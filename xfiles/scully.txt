 You’re not sure? Any indication what would have been the cause of death?  Detective? Mulder, what do you think it is? Disappeared? Mulder, what we just saw was not decomposition. What about you? Where are you going? It’s not a problem, is it?  You sound surprised. Why? Old-fashioned?  Like this one? I appreciate your concern, Detective, but it’s not necessary. Where would you like the autopsy report sent? The date is august 29th. The time is 4:15 pm.  Scully.  How do you know it’s the same guy?  Mulder, I’d like you to meet me at the coroner’s  There’s not going to be an autopsy. It’s a metacarpal from Lauren MacKalvey’s hand. It’s organic. Mostly hydrochloric acid similar to what is Almost identical only twice as acidic. I don’t know how else to explain such accelerated autolysis. In some broken-down form, yes.  Missing? I don’t think so.  All the body tissues What weight discrepancy? She probably lost weight since the license was issued.  What possible motivation could the killer have  All of the air passages are blocked with  Here’s something else that might Good. We are expanding the search to include the faculty I’m almost done with the list. And?   "The second sample contains no oils or essential From a dry skin sample you’re concluding what? ….which he ingests before the rest of the body dissolves Yes, scorpions predigest their food outside of their body by I’d like to brief them, if that’s okay with you. Mr. Brenman? I’m Special Agent Scully from the FBI.  These are all University addresses. Cross hasn’t checked in yet. We’ve been trying his  He would have been by sometime this morning. Mulder … the landlady’s body --- I know this is hard to talk about right now, but I need Your mother’s perfume? And you smelled it in his apartment? He grabbed you? What suitcase? Did he say where? Okay, Jesse. That helps us. I’m going to take a couple Yeah? I don’t know, Jesse. What about employment records? He told the girl he was on his way to New York. What is it? Well, how are we going to track him? Yeah. And the bad news? You were right, Mulder. They’re coming up empty at the  "Friend?"  We need this scanned I’m going to call the online service and have them fax us  Just lock your doors until we contact you again. Well, we’ve already contacted everyone on this list directly Mulder …. You go ahead. I’ll stay here. Go.  This is Federal Agent Dana Scully. Why? You’re more than a monster. Not anymore.  Let me out. Monica, I'm so sorry. Agent Doggett is just coming out of surgery and they're moving him to the ICU. If he pulls through this, it's likely that he'll be paralysed for life. I saw something once. It's only been the last couple of years that I've... fully come to terms with it.  Scully.  Yeah, she's here, we're both at the hospital.  What's this about? What is this? I'm going to put a stop to this. Follmer's case has a couple potential holes. For starters, there's the fact that when I called you, you were at home. Plus there's the condition of your gun. However, the bullet does match your gun. Perfectly. I don't know. It could just be a muscle spasm. It's not uncommon with this type of spinal injury.  Lukesh. Fully conscious. We set up a communication device designed for spinal injuries ............ You all right, Agent Reyes? It's understandable Where's she gone? He's in there. He's got to be. And what if it is? Want to stick around to find out? Mulder? Answer me! I want to know what's on that train. Our government is operating a secret railroad. They put something What the Japanese have to do with it. How a man named Ishimaru Don't tell me you don't know, you smug son of a b... I don't have time for your convenient ignorance. You know them too? The implant. Biological information? But what? Memory formation. Like a computer hard drive. You could know a person's every thought. They've seen this technology before? What do you mean? It's Japanese, isn't it? Oh, it was just a guess. Well done, Agent Pendrell. Keep up the good work. Hey! Who are you? Don't worry. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm an What kind of facility? Hansen's Dis... do you mean this is a leper colony? L, look. I, I, I came here looking for a Doctor Shiro Zama. Where did they go? What death squads? How many have been killed? I don't understand how there could have been hundreds of people Who were the others? And they had Hansen's disease? Oh, my God... oh... Wait! Hey! How did you know my name? What are you talking about? Who are you? What is this place? I've seen your methods of elimination. What happened to the Exposed to what? You mean Ishimaru. You hid him here after the war. He stayed What was he exposing these people to? What kinds of things? Who knows? Mulder, it's me. I'm in West Virginia. Mulder, we've gotten involved in something, but it's not at Whatever is on that train is not alien. Mulder, Ishimaru Zama... The leper colony was just a front. The tests weren't just on The man who handed me the phone. Because of what he's shown me. Mulder, I'm standing in a train car just like the one in your This is where they brought me, Mulder. This is where they put It all makes sense, Mulder. Ishimaru Zama, he was using the Can you hear me? What I am saying, Mulder, is that there is no such thing as That wasn't a... Because I have what I told you I needed, Mulder... proof. Two Mulder, listen to me. You have got to stay out of that train Because there is a bomb on board. Well, then we've got to get you out of there. 'Cause that device There should be... Did you find it, Mulder? How much time do you have? Look, Mulder, you've got to get them to stop that train so we So we can get a bomb squad out there. Did you hear that? Mulder? Mul... It's not on the map. Scully. Damn it, Mulder, what happened? Yeah, I figured that, do you have any idea where you are? Mulder, if I'm right, they're not going to want to find you... We're not waiting for anything, Mulder, we got to get you... Yes, hello, my name is Dana Scully and I'm trying to reach Senator Mulder? I think I've got something here. I think I may have a code for you. Your alien autopsy video. I've got six minutes left, is that what you have? One. Yeah, yeah. One, zero, one. And a three... then a three... Uh... I can't see the last number clearly. His hand gets in I know, I'm sorry, um... I think it's a one. Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty sure. Mulder? Are there any satellite photos you can get your hands on? Well, the administrator at the hospital where you were admitted Yeah. I got it right here. It's the one they gave me, the one they said you gave to the Mulder... They've gotten away with it, Mulder. The bodies at the leper And I know what I saw at that research facility. It was barely    Special Agent Dana Scully.    Out where?      What he means is I don't hear    Apparently, so does Mr. Dales.    Look, Mr. Dales, I'm sure that there is good reason for your alarm.    In the bathroom, you said?       And you have no reason to doubt Ms. Shipley's report?     What is it that brought you out here in the first place, Mr.    At least it looks like they had the time and the presence of mind    Hello!  Mrs. Shipley!    Mulder... No sign of life.    How the hell did the cat get in the washing machine?    Where do you think this leads to?      Mr. Shipley!    Sir, we're Agents Scully and Mulder.   I can show you my ba - ...    Well, what else would we be doing out here on a night like this?       Deputy...    I'll be in the car.      Yeah.  No...  Thank you.      Great. Mulder, they're threatening to close the airport.  I think    Yes, I'm curious, Mulder but I'm also suspicious.  I mean, I... I    Because sea monsters can only be read about, Mulder, because they    You know what? Maybe you are a member of the Manson family.    This is an emergency.    Well, what about the airport?  Is there an alternate route?    Sir, it's important that we evacuate the area.  We're FBI agents    I'd be happy to show you my I.D…    Mulder.      Hello?       Is this the Collier County Sheriff?  Yes. Oh, hi.      Nance Road.  (listens for a moment and looks pointedly      Hello? Hello...     No service.    I don't need my mettle tested.    What was that?    Mulder, we have to pull over.  We have to wait out this storm    We don't know where we are and we don't know where we're going.    Mulder, isn't that...    Deputy?  Hello?  Anybody... Mulder, he's in here.    Can you talk to me?    You're having trouble breathing? This man needs a trach or he's    Mulder, I need you to hold his head real steady.  (MULDER is not    I don't know but he's having a reaction which is affecting his    All I know is we have to get a medivac unit out here as soon as       This is Special Agent Dana Scully       I have an officer in need of emergency medical       My name is Dana... Scully.       I'm a medical doctor requesting a medivac unit       I have a deputy who's been attacked by something       His vitals are weak and he's in shock.  Now, I    He's had some kind of foreign organism released into his body.  His    I don't know.  It may have been some kind of a water-borne    I'm sorry. I don't know who Harry is.    He may have evacuated.    Yeah.    We can't.    Mulder, I just got off the radio. They won't even chance sending a    It looks that way.  At least until the weather breaks.    I don't think these wounds are bites or stings.  There's something       You're not far off.  It's 106.    Yeah, well, it may be but unless we get his temperature down he's    We need to put this man in ice water as soon as possible.    I need a container.  Mulder, lift him up.  We have to get him into    All that happened here is a sewage pipe burst.    Look, you guys, whatever this thing is there's no evidence yet that    The man in the bathtub may very well be saved if he can just last    How is he?       We'll be waiting for you out here.    Mulder, nothing I've seen convinces me there's a monster …    Mulder, there is no evidence of any creature here.  Those organisms    Mulder?    It's gone?    Where'd he go?    Mulder, if that were true then this wouldn't be visible, would it?    Mulder, the Shipleys weren't even in their house.     We're in the middle of a hurricane.    Mulder, we cant.  There's no way we can transport everybody.    Mulder?    Mulder, if we're going to leave we should leave now.    Mulder?!  Hey, Mulder, are you okay?    Hey... wait a second.  What are you doing?!    That's my partner out there!    You can't just leave him there!    He'll die!    Well, I can at least keep him breathing!    Look, at least let me try.  I'm a medical doctor.      We're going to need water.  If I'm going to    You don't.  The truth is I've never delivered a baby before.  So    You got it.  Breathe... Breathe.  Okay, Angela,  I'm going to need    You got it.  You got it.  You're on the right track.        I need some towels, damn it!    You're doing good.  You're doing good. Okay.  You're doing good.    I can feel it up there!    Okay, come on.  Puuush!  Good!  You got it.  Okay.  Here it comes.    Here it comes.  It's coming.  Okay.    It's the water.    It's the water!    Okay!    Push!    It's coming! Push!  Push!    Okay!       Okay, now pick up the gun.       Pick up the gun!    Shoot out the sprinklers!  Just point and shoot!  Shoot out the    Well, it's official.  Ten pounds, ten ounces of piss and vinegar.    Oh, yes.    What's that?       Well, you wouldn't have known to go out in the Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been several Father, I’m an FBI agent. I’ve taken it as my code In a way. I was here for Easter services last week Because there was a family that he felt needed my help. Yes.  Father, I told you that I had a sin to confess … An innocent girl is dead because of me. I could’ve I’ve been trying to make an effort to come more often. No, I’m afraid I don’t. No, I didn’t. Are you asking for my help? Oh, Father McCue said that, uh, that you’ve been having What do you mean? Could somebody have taken her out of her room? Mrs. Kernof was talking about her husband, but she might I felt drawn to these people, Father … in a very personal As much as I have my faith, Father, I am a scientist trained You think it was lightning? Her mother said that she was found in a kneeling position. Why do you ask? Looks like there was surgery done on her hands. What’s the connection? Dara Kernof was adopted. I don’t suppose that you’ve No, that’s okay. I, uh … I have someone I can ask. Somebody  Hello?  Hi .. uh, something’s come up. I was, uh, hoping  This isn’t official FBI business so I  I need some birth and adoptive  Dara Kernof. I can’t tell  Not until you get me those records. What so you mean? Mulder, it’s not what you think. I - I didn’t want You found Dara’s records? I think one of my questions has already been answered. Uh, yes, as far as I know. Why? Put there by whom? Not as of this time. Uh, it’s doubtful. Paula Koklos was severely impaired It appears that their eyes were burnt out. Their They might. What makes you so sure? Mr. Starkey, do you happen to know if that cross over Did she have any visitors or anybody who might have left By who? What kind of church is this? Father Gregory? I’m Dana Scully. We’re here about the death of Paula Are you all right, Father? Do you know where she is? We were looking for her name. It’s not listed on The other two girls may be in danger. We’re hoping Can you give us a name? I brought Agent Mulder on the case to help temper my feelings Yes. I think you’re a little extreme in your judgment, don’t Well, he said this wasn’t done by the hand of man. What? But, basically, you’re ruling out any element of the supernatural? Well, Dara Kernof was baptized on the day of her death. I was raised to believe that God has His reasons, The victim is Paula Koklos, age 16, cause of death unknown.  Oh, God.  I told myself that it was all in my head … a hallucination But that’s not what it was, Father. I was meant To save these girls.  What do you mean?  Where?  Well, Mulder, if she shares anything  There’s evidence of a progressive  Mulder, there’s something else St. Peter would only be crucified upside-down out of humility Yes. He believed that he could find the last girl. But I wasn’t sure. Father Gregory said that the Devil I know now that Father Gregory was mistaken. The Father Gregory called them Messengers. Mulder, he knows where she is. You’re not going find her. I think you’re being I saw Emily. She came to me in a vision. You go. Go find the girl. I’m going to finish I’d like to get back in here. Father Gregory?  Father Gregory?  Hello?  He’s dead, Mulder.  Father Gregory. They found him Father? I’m not sure if they should be, Father. I’ve seen things. Things that have made me question Visions … of my daughter Emily, for one. I considered that, um… but then I saw something last night, How did he bring back their souls? Do you think that’s what I saw? But I saw it, Father. Father, do you believe that … God has His reasons? What is it? Trying to reach me for what? There’s no one here.  My name is Dana. I’m I’m going to take you someplace safe. Everything’s going to be fine. No, it’s okay. It’s all right. Stay here. It’s okay. Stay Emily. Emily? Emily?! Oh, God. I felt sure of it. No. I thought I could, Father, but I can’t. Yes. You mean, accepting my loss? Maybe that’s what faith is.      Time passes in moments ...  moments which, rushing      But what if we could stop, pause to take stock of each    I got the lab to rush the results of...    I said, I got the lab to rush the results of the Szczesny autopsy,    And Szczesny did indeed drown but not as the result of the    Margarita mix, upchucked with about 40 ounces of Corcovado    No, I don't.    Crop circles, Mulder?    Hmm?    I am.    I guess I just don't see the point.    Getting where?    Mulder, I still have to go over to the hospital and-and-and finish    What it means, Mulder, is I'm not interested in tracking down    And besides, I mean... what could you possibly get out of this?    Mulder...    Look, we're always running.  We're always chasing the next big    My name is Dana Scully and I was told I could pick up a postmortem    Thank you.    Hi, um... I was given the wrong test results.   This, uh, x-ray    Thank you.  Is the, um... is the "D. Waterston" that was on the    Thank you.    Um, I'm sorry.  I'm Dr. Scully.  I-I was just in the hospital and...    Yeah.    Uh, yes, Dana Scully.    I'm sorry, you must be mistaken.    He has a heart condition?    Then it's serious.    No, that's all right.  But, uh, thanks for your time.    Yes...  he's a remarkable man.       Hello?       I'm sorry, who is this?       Maggie.  Is everything all right?       I'm sorry?       About what?       I don't know, Maggie.  I don't know if I've got time.       Maggie, can you hang on a second?  I have another       Hello?    Hello?       Mulder, aren't you supposed to be on a plane?       Right.  Guess I lost track of time.       No, I just walked in. Why?       Mulder, I'm not going.       I'm out for the evening, Mulder.       Look, um... why don't you leave that address on    I'm sorry.   I-I have the wrong room.    Hi.    Surely not the Devil.    How are you feeling, Daniel?    You're extremely lucky you called that diagnosis.       Daniel...    So, how did you happen to be here in Washington?    Is that why you wanted to see me?  To remind me once again    You scare me, Daniel.    You never accepted my reason for leaving.    But you understood why.    I'm sorry I came.    I just wanted to make sure you were okay.       Scully.       She researches crop circles?       Mulder you want me to...?    Hi.  I'm...    You were...       Right.  That's strange.  Um, I-I'm Agent Scully.  I'm-I'm here    For the FBI, as odd as that may sound.    No, thank you.  I think I need some fresh air.    Yes, I... I mean, yes, I-I'm just a little shaken.  I... a near    I'm sorry?    Look, I-I don't mean to be rude but I really don't have much time.    Uh, to be honest, I don't know exactly what it is that you do.    I really should be going.       Hello.    I was summoned.    Prednisone?  That won't complicate cardiac arrhythmia.    How did she even find out?    What things?    Bad how?    You divorced.    Where did you go?    When?       Daniel...  you didn't move here for me?    Oh, God.    You've come at such a strange time.       I don't know what I have.  I mean...  your    I want everything I should want at this time of my life.    Nurse!  We have a code in here!   Nurse!    He's in v-fib, get his head.    In!    200 joules.  All clear?    300 joules.    Clear!    Epinephrine, one milligram, I.V. Push.  Now!  Who's paying    Clear!    We have a pulse.    Okay.  Thank you.    Uh, I'm looking for Colleen.    I just need to speak with her that's all.    I'm sorry that I was rude before.  I'm a medical doctor and a    I have a friend who's ill, and, um... I had a strange feeling    Hmm... Yes.    What are you saying that I saw?    But he has a heart condition.    Yes.  It's so strange.    I'm sorry.    But how?    I'm sorry?   I was just going up to see your father.    Since when?    Maggie, to be honest, I left so that there wouldn't be hell in    We have nothing but Dr. Waterston's welfare in mind here.    I understand that.  What's taking place here is an alternative    I just wanted to help him.  It seemed like nothing else was       Hello?       Maggie, what's...?    Daniel?    You were slipping away.  No one thought you'd come out of this.    I was afraid it didn't work.    Daniel, that "crap" may have just saved your life whether you're    I spoke at length to Maggie.  It's time... that you took    Maybe the reason you're alive now is to make up for that.       No.  I'm not the same person, Daniel.    Excuse me!    Mulder?    But you're supposed to be in England.    What happened?    Maybe sometimes nothing happens for a reason, Mulder.    Nothing.     Come on, I'm make you some tea.    What part?    Mmm, I didn't say my whole life changed.    Mmm, and I didn't say that God spoke back.  I said that I had    I once considered spending my whole life with this man.    What if there was only one choice and all the other ones were I'm not staying, Agent Doggett. My doctor told me to take my maternity leave. In fact, she insisted on it. It's a medallion commemorating the Apollo 11 space flight. I'd like to give this to you, Agent Doggett. Agent Mulder gave it to me a few years back. It symbolizes team-work, partnership. . It means no-one gets there alone. And after this past year and everything that we've been through, it just,  I wouldn't be here without you. Yeah. I'll just get my keys. How do you know all these things, Mulder? Thank you for doing this with me. I don't know, I, uh, maybe it's hormones, or, I just, it's just, I'm just feeling so strange about all this. No, no, leaving work, I guess. I mean, I, I walked out of that office today feeling like a deserter. You know, the entire time that I was down there I had someone to watch my back. Is it true? I can't reach Agent Doggett and someone told me he's gone missing. Why wasn't I told?  I'm heading into the Bureau right now. Sir, are you ordering me not to go looking for Agent Doggett? I know that you are. But what if it's not enough? Thank you. What are you doing here, Mulder? I found something that may prove helpful in locating Agent Doggett. This is Arlen Sacks, the murder victim Doggett was investigating. This old man was not murdered, Mulder, he died of heart failure evidently after he was blinded by a chemical substance of some kind. The orbits have residual traces of a slimy substance,  known as hydrolytic enzymes. How do you know that. I, uh, I also found some bacteria in the venom which I am going to do a culture on. I know. But this is an X-File, Mulder, and you are out of the Bureau. If now I go home, where is Skinner going to find someone qualified to look into this. Mulder, what are you doing? I just got off the phone with Skinner who is furious. This man Stites just called him saying you've been impersonating Deputy Director Kersh and making baseless accusations. Mulder, the victim had reptile venom in his eyes, are you now saying that it was a man who did this? I know this may be hard to believe coming from me but some kind of reptile attack is the only explanation consistent with the scientific evidence. Now why do you say that? I'm sorry? You found it? I gotta go. What am I looking at? It looks like they're breaking down the tissue.  Digestive enzymes. So the reptile sprays its victim, then all it has to do is wait. Yeah, but there are no species that can do all of this. At least not yet. You were right about Herman Stites, Mulder. Well, Stites is a crypto-biologist, specialising in reptile genetics. Listen to this. It says here that he published a monograph last year claiming to be on the verge of creating a new species of reptile. I don't know. He dropped out of sight and never published a follow-up. But Mulder, the bacteria inside this venom - if Stites is genetically altering reptile breeds it may explain the peculiar properties. Mulder, are you listening to me? Mulder?  Mulder? Mulder! Mulder! Agent Doggett. No. No. How is she? Skinner said she won't be returning to the X-Files. Um, well, first of all, it was never  actually proven that it was a spaceship ... Well, no, what happened was that we fell off of something that ...  ... that rose out of the ice. Well, I don't know what it was. But we never got, we didn't actually get to see a spaceship. Well, it couldn't have been a spaceship. Well, we don't know it was a spaceship. But you don't have a picture of it or anything. No, no, no, no, remember, I was unconscious and when I woke up there was no spaceship. Mulder, n-n-n-no. And you were frozen, and I hugged you ....     Aren't you going home?    What you got?    You mind if I ask the cause of death?    From what?    A dog?   A "dog" dog?       What happened to the dog?    Yeah, I got it.  Did anybody, um, examine the victims, Mulder?    Look, bite wounds are rarely lethal in themselves.  I mean, they    Mulder, I don't have to tell you how absolutely and completely    Two grown men?       You're not going to tell me that a dog did this.    Yeah.       What did you find?    I don't suppose you can tell us what kind of dog this is.       Don't mind him.  He'll go on forever.  Did you    A breed of what?    And you have one of these?    Jake Conroy, age 30.  He was employed as a customs agent by the    Well, it does make sense.  I mean, a victim and his dog are    Well, then what?    You mean covering up crime scenes?    So, you're talking about a dog that has human intelligence.      Yeah, he doesn't listen and he chews on    You sure this woman's not an authority on bats?    How is it that you know so much about her but you don't know what    But you assume that she's going to help us?      Oh, so you two are chummy?      Ah. The Wolf Inside...  Dogs Don't    Well, she seems to have made a connection to you.    Intelligence enough to murder?    What about a Dhole?    Mulder... She's a friend of yours?    On-line...    Is it the same dog?       I don't think wolfwoman is here to speak to    Did they tell you anything?    And that's what you think the print indicates?    Just yesterday you dismissed the possibility outright, that a dog    But you'll accept the idea that it behaves in every other way like       Oh, I'm... fairly    How well do you know this woman, Mulder?  Well,  I question her motives.    She's enamored of you, Mulder.  Don't underestimate a woman. They    I'm a federal agent.  I'm armed.  If you can hear me, don't move.    Mulder?    Come take a look at this.    I'll call the paramedics.    Continuing his investigation.    No. This is my investigation.    You.    I thought at first that they were eccentricities or affectations--    Ironic or perverse?    But not with Mulder.  With Mulder, you found somebody you could       You don't believe it, do you-- not for    More cunning than you?      I'm watching you.       Now tell me why you pulled me away from the suspect    What do you mean?        Mulder...    So, what is he going to do?  Walk in here, skitter across the    Mulder, the only thing Karin Berquist is interested in is you.    You're kidding yourself if you think that she hasn't manipulated    Well, you've got no argument from me.    Mulder...    You going home?    You think this is your fault.    Why wouldn't you believe her?      Well, she had a lot of secrets, that's for sure.  I think    You going to be okay?    Oh.  This came for you. Mulder, Skinner's looking for you. Why, what's going on.? You want me to recite them.? What are you talking about.? What is this.? Where did you get this.? Mulder, this may not be gibberish.

Of course, he's my partner. Yes sir. A year and a half ago. I've been writing Am I accused of lying.? What action is that.? Is that all sir.? You didn't answer your door. I couldn't find you at work.

You didn't give me much choice, you were If he is, then his weapon is probably the same one that killed If you killed Krycek with that weapon there would have been I didn't. I went back to your apartment to pull the slug It's a dyalysis filter. It's a device used in the transmission Well it wasn't an excercise in subtlety. Mulder these We're in Farmington New Mexico. We've just driven two days across country, I had to put you Albert was a Navajo code talker during world war two. He helped Through a woman in Washington. But he claims he knew Most of these files are written in jargon but apparently there I'm afraid you're on your own with this. I didn't show I was certain they would have killed you Mulder. There's something else. My name is in those files. It's not clear, but it has something to do with a test. Scully. Where are you.? What do you mean.? Bodies.? What happened to them.? Mulder, in these files I found references to experiments that Some kind of tests, on humans. What they referred to Are you sure.? Mulder... Excuse me, where can I find Walter Skinner? He was brought in Agent Fuller.  How bad is he? What happened? What do we have on the shooter? Hair and fiber? This is the assistant director who's been shot. We have to make Excuse me.  How is he?  He's on steady Demerol, he's in and out. I thought I asked for This wasn't a random shooting. I want guards posted here and I've heard the excuses. I don't care if you and agent Caleca I got a message you called. It's on the shooter? Which tells us we're looking for a male, probably in his 40s We still gotta find the guy before we can get a match. This takes too much time. You know what, run them anyway. Can Thanks. What happened?      The State police found you unconscious. You were strapped in Who's "we"? Krycek? Is that what the men wanted?

Do you realize what you're saying sir? You're saying, that they closed down my sister's case not because The man who shot you.. you said that you've seen him before. He was working with Krycek? Damn it! Krycek, Mulder had him. I'll be ok  It's exactly what they want  
 Addendum to case number 621517, in the absence What's this doing here? Evidence of what? What kind of oil? I don't understand. I still don't understand how did this get onto the diver and So you're saying that this stuff has intelligence. Waiting to jump into the diver and then into the diver's wife. Krycek? Is anybody not looking for Krycek? Beautiful. I'll bet. What do you mean? Does he have an alias? Damn it, they think they can just get away with it. Keep looking for him. What's it gonna take? I've seen stranger things, believe me. Scully. They should be why? I got it covered Mulder. Nurse, what happened to the guards who were outside this room? Where did they go? And what happened to the man who was in this Where is he? Where did they take him? Thank you.

If I'm correct they were all My ears are still popping. Where's the concrete? 1 down, 199 silos to go. We saw bodies in there.  Men with radiation I was just thinking about something that a man said to me. That You know I thought... when we found him, this man that killed What are you talking about? How? And what about Krycek? You think they got to him too. I think the dead are speaking to us Mulder, demanding justice.    We pronounce it "Pee-trie," actually.   (struggling with the large basket that MULDER makes no move to help    I'm sorry?    This place really is immaculate, Pat.  I, uh, I wouldn't mind    "Pee-trie."    Excuse me!  I'll get that.

01 p.m., February 24.  Agents Scully and Mulder in the    The local police departments were at a dead end so they turned to    Rob and Laura Petrie?    Mulder, if we ever go undercover again I get to choose the names,    It just tells me that you're not taking this seriously.    Sure it is.  It's unexplained.  What do you want, aliens? Tractor    Hi.  Well, you didn't need to do that.      Hi.    Oh.  That's a caduceus.  Are you a doctor, Mike?    Mighty nice of you, Mike.  I, uh ... gosh, with all this    Mulder...

What do you mean?       In the ground.  This huge creature you think you saw?      Look, Mulder, huge creatures aside do you care to hear what I    These are the lab results from the San Diego PD.  First of all, the    Mm-hmm. We found this stuff everywhere because it is everywhere.    Yeah?    You mean buried in the yard?    Well, once we start a      Hey.  Mulder.

Several residents of the falls  have now come Mulder! I need your help! Any cavities? Well, there's a filling on the occlusal surface of the upper That name sounds familiar. What's your interest in this case? Believing in the paranormal? Which is? I guess that's why we're going to Aubrey. Detective Morrow, exactly how did you discover the remains? These bones are in good condition. But I think the field may Well, that's poetic but it doesn't help us much. Mulder, these cuts on the ribs -- they could have been made No, but we might be able to if we can find somebody in I've scanned the images from the crime photo and the ribcage Mulder, I don't think BJ was in the woods that night because Well, the Motel Black would have been the perfect meeting It's obvious BJ and Tillman are having an affair. A woman senses these things. The image on the right is Chaney's ribcage. The one on the I'm searching for any matching pattern of cuts. Feeling better? Things must be difficult for you now. I've had ... feelings for  No, not yet.  Nightmares? Have you talked to anyone about these nightmares? What are you going to do?  Well, BJ's Well, it could be a word, or it could just be random slashes. Well, that means getting a court order. It could take a couple No, those were from a case that Agent Ledbetter and BJ? What do you think it is? Do you know why they might have been in your dream?  This is the man BJ claims to have seen in her dream.  Harry Cokely. He lives in Gainesville, Nebraska since He was convicted in 1945 for rape and attempted murder. No. But Mulder, the man we're talking about is 77 years old. What if it's cryptamnesia? Yeah. BJ told us that her father was a policeman in the area. What if the recent murders triggered what was previously Yeah, something like that. I seem to recall you having some pretty extreme hunches. Mr. Cokely, our records show that in 1942, you lived in Well, I'm sure Mrs. Thibedeaux will never forget it. What kind of pills?  That won't be necessary. For now.  Thought you might need these. You hurt yourself. Cokely attacked you? Well, I'll have Tillman pick him up. (Looks at MULDER with  Mulder? I have the preliminary results from the genetic testing from The results strongly suggest that. Imagine the strength of Well, she's not the first. Mrs. Thibedeaux also survived his I know this goes back a long way, Mrs. Thibedeaux, but can The bones BJ found under the house belong to Chaney's Yeah, but you know the state of mind she was in that night. Are you saying Cokely's grandson attacked BJ?  I don't think Mendel had serial What?  Yeah, Danny Valladeo, it's Agent Scully. But children aren't born liking sunflower seeds. Waldo?  Yeah, Danny. (pause as she listens, then shock BJ is Cokely's granddaughter. Mulder ... Wait, Mulder. Do you honestly think that BJ is capable of That's outrageous! So you're saying that BJ's nightmares are real? That, that Well then how do you explain the cuts on her own chest? Where are we going? Mulder. (She rushes up the stairs to the landing, where MRS. Can you stand? Let me help you up the steps. BJ's going after Tillman. The first murder occurred after BJ Why? I'm giving a statement. Can we talk about this outside? Have you seen Detective Morrow?  Detective Morrow Freeze! (Audibly she cocks her weapon; she's got BJ Let him go. Let him go, BJ. He's dead.  We are continuing with genetic testing on Detective  Detective Morrow has not demonstrated any further  Amniocentesis results show no genetic abnormalities. Well, the man who hit her had fifteen. Don't do this to yourself, It's true, John. She's gone. There's no measurable electrical activity in her brain. Brain death I'm sorry. John ... John, at the end of the day it doesn't matter. It doesn't change the I did note some minor swelling in the left anterior which is I-I don't know if that means anything. It's not like there's an exact Yeah. She had EEG monitoring after the point that she coded. Agent Doggett. What exactly are you thinking? You're thinking that somebody murdered her to cover something up. Well, I'd use a fast-acting barbiturate like pentobarbital. I'd use a Agent Doggett ... I'm happy to do this for you. Just don't kid I'll call you back. Monica's parents are on their way from Mexico City. They're coming to What are these? Dr. Jack Preijers. Well, at the request of the family. How did you come up with these two men's names? The transplant teams are in place. John ... I'm still waiting for your argument. If you have something  Mulder, it's me. I just got your message. I don't understand. Most of it. Mulder, I'm on my way.  The conspicuous absence of any contusions Her spinal cord was crushed, Mulder. The cervical So far. They found no semen samples. There was Have they learned anything more? Have you talked to anybody she worked with? An indiscretion? What kind of work? Give me five minutes here.  Addendum
 observed what appears to be a Business must be booming. We'd like to ask you some questions about an employee Well, you can start by telling us if she was working last I also doubt that they'd want to get entangled in a homicide It just doesn't seem like him. Well, I think the lack of discretion is the least of his sins. No, but that doesn't mean that we can discount the evidence. Look, Mulder, I feel the same way about Skinner as you do, Skinner was in bed with a prostitute at the time of her Even if it means proving his guilt? Who was that? Why won't you tell us what happened last night, sir? Do you know him? We were just a little caught off guard. Neither of us even Has he always been such a private person? Including you? Is that why you were separated? Excuse me. Sorry. Mulder, we've gotta go.  You have our What's going on here? That's right. Available for what? He's doing everything he shouldn't be doing. He's behaving like a guilty man, Mulder. It's his irrational behavior that concerns me. It speaks to I *am*, Mulder, believe me.  Well, maybe he doesn't remember. Not necessarily. This man is running away from a train. He sees it coming No, night terrors and sleep walking occur doing slow-wave This video tape came from the Bethesda Sleep Disorder The same disorder, different dreams.  Defending himself against this imaginary old woman. It isn't? Visits them for sex?  What's that? I feel kinda strange saying this, but I found something It's a circular patch around the victim's mouth and nose, I know what I saw, Mulder. It was here. No. It was definitely visible to the naked eye. Yeah. I sent on over to Chem-Tox. Well, my first hunch was that it was some kind of a fungal That there was no analyzable substance in the sample Mulder, I'm afraid this isn't exactly something that I'd make That he did it? Number 5. According to Woltos' report, the hood was still warm when The only prints they found on the steering wheel were Sure. Why? I don't know what you're expecting to find, Mulder, but uh, What are you doing? Yes, sir. No, sir. None of the physical evidence we recovered directly I took a sample of an extraneous substance that turned A naturally occurring enzyme around her mouth and nose. No. Sir, I feel reluctant to say or to speak for Agent Mulder. Agent Mulder had a theory that the substance could have No. I'm sorry, I don't. Whatever extreme cases I have encountered I have always Excuse me, sir, I don't understand the question. No, sir. Not at all. I believe the Assistant Director has protected us out of a No. That is not true. Sir, if I may ... I'm not finished.  Mulder? You missed it. Not that anything you said would have Out of a job. He would have had a better chance against a firing squad. How'd you know? But why? What am I looking at? I don't understand. Why would they orchestrate such an Who is this guy? So how are we supposed to find him? So he must have hired the prostitute. Mulder, look. Judy, we need you to identify somebody. And Lorraine. He's cleaning house. Agent Mulder's right. I'll stay with you if you want, until  Did you get him? He should have been here fifteen minutes ago.  Nothing.  Maybe it's the rain. Mulder, hang on a second.  Judy? Mulder, get up here right now. Judy? I'm sorry. I called but you didn't answer. What's the matter? Uhhh ... Mmm-hmmm ... Sir? This is our report. You'll see, though, that several We ran his face and fingerprints through every available Mulder? Mulder-- Skinner wants our report in one hour. I'll tell him exactly what I saw. First of all, if the family of Ronnie Strickland does indeed Where is your proof? Oh, you want our stories straight. I don't feel comfortable with that. All right. The very beginning? (Mulder returns to his desk and takes You want us to go to Dallas? (Mulder talks through this Exsanguinations? Of whom? Is it a...? Is there any sign of --? I wasn't asking that. Well, these may be syringe marks. Their placement meant You're not gonna tell me you think it's that Mexican So, instead, this would be... Of a bunch of cows. Why the hell didn't you tell me that from the beginning? The town of Chaney is too small to maintain a morgue No exam has been done? Well, my theory has evolved. Basically, I think that we're Well, someone so obsessed might well file down their Well, there is a psychological fixation called hematodipsia Mmm. There are also genetic afflictions which cause a You're gonna interrupt me or what? Anyway ... that's when you had your big ... Mulder, what's your point? Mulder ... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What am I even looking for? He does that. 4
54 PM, begin autopsy on white male, age 60, who is Heart weighs 370 grams, tissue appears healthy. Stomach contents show last meal close to the time of Having completed the autopsy I checked into the Davey Chloral hydrate. What the hell happened to you? (She sits up on the bed. Yeah. That thing that you didn't know that you were looking My ...  Exactly. Tonight? I just put money in the magic fingers! This one's my room, Mulder. Don't get mud everywhere. Yeah. The guy in there'll pay for it. (She walks to the car Foregoing both dinner and sleep, I was soon back at the Mulder? Well, luckily, I'd gotten there in time. I mean, though you Mulder? Are you okay? (She turns his face to her and Long story short. Though my first four shots obviously Well, I'm going to argue that we caught a killer -- an Excuse me? Mulder?  Why don't you tell me Why are we going to Dallas? Like what? It's a dead cow. Why am I looking at six dead cows? And? On what do you base that?! Well, it's obviously not a vampire. Because they don't exist? It's not that Mexican goat sucker, either. Hoo, boy. He had big buck teeth? No, he didn't.  And that's significant?  No exam has In short, Sheriff, no. This can't be what it looks like. I think  Thank you. If there's a point, Mulder, please feel free to come to it. Now, why is it so important that his shoes were untied? Mulder, shoelaces? On the corpse. You were going to tell me what was Why skip ahead? What happened then?  What do you mean you want me to do another autopsy?! Don't you touch that bed. Mulder? You're saying that I actually hit him two times? And then he sort of flew at me like a flying squirrel? Mulder, it's not just me. Nobody in their right mind will ever Mulder, please just keep reminding him you were drugged. It wouldn't hurt. But ... he was dead. With a stake through his heart. So we should find Ronnie out here because ...? Oh. But Mulder, he had fake fangs. Why would a real vampire Well, so where the hell is he? Well, an aunt and an uncle. Their mail comes general Sheriff Hartwell.  Where are you going? Thanks. You mean aside from the fact that I don't believe in them? Well ... they're supposed to be extremely charming. Mulder?  I came to in the cemetery. That's all I know. Well, I can neither confirm nor deny agent Mulder's version Anyway... I was drugged. Essentially.    Good morning.  I'm sorry I'm late.  I didn't get a chance to look at the case    Who are we talking about?    Did the M.E. See it?  The body?    No sign of forced entry?    So, basically what you're saying is that nobody knows anything.       A child's print.    Mm...    No. From what I see, Agent Doggett, from the way this man died... I doubt it    But regardless, I'd say it's wise you keep an open mind.    Big is a relative term, Agent Doggett.  It took three strong men to wheel him    I'm missing the point.    Well, considering what I found here today I'd say I have to agree.    Tissue damage.  Massive trauma to the lower intestine and the rectal wall.    Well, unfortunately there's so much damage that it's hard to tell.    I took MRIs, which reveal further shredding throughout the abdomen and,    Are you suggesting that he's a mule?  A courier of heroine or opiates?  Drug    Well, I'd say, uh, that's a good theory, Agent Doggett, not to mention a    Not exactly.  I ran a decay analysis to, uh, determine the time of death.    24 to 36 hours.    Well, it would mean that, uh, Mr. Potocki here would have died before he    I told you to keep an open mind.    Bad connection?    Look at this.  Albert Brecht's passport was a recent issue and it has his    Well, that's a pretty big lie.  I mean, that's a 33 pound discrepancy.    Yeah.  As was our DC victim.  All the better for accommodation.       Well, something has to account for the weight gain, Agent    I understand, Agent Doggett and I can't prove it... but I bet that if we had    I appreciate your resistance but so far this evidence supports it.    Yeah.  That's not all he claims he saw.    He said he called his dad in because there was something in his room.  I    How can you be sure?    Right.  Which is exactly what the boy said that his father did.  But it's the    Unless that's just the first stage.    This is Special Agent Dana Scully.  I am a medical doctor about to perform    I suppose distention could be due to decomposition gases... but that seems    Oh.    Agent Mulder consulted with Dr. Burks on occasion and I have to admit that    These ascetic masters... they have abilities?    Chuck... Could one of these Siddhi mystics make you believe that he    What?    Chuck.  Thank you for, uh, coming down here again.    This, uh... this case, I-I-I-I'm just... I'm trying to see it the way that Mulder    You described these, uh, Siddhi mystics as being religious men.    So, presumably using those powers for murder would be in opposition of    Which got me thinking that, uh... if these Siddhi hold so fast to their    Something human?    Revenge?    This is... an American chemical plant in a village in India called, uh, Vishi.    Now, I'd say, right here.  It's an 11-year-old boy... whose father is described    Do you think that this boy's father could be a Siddhi mystic like you    She came out to call her son in for dinner.  That's all we know.    What are we doing?  A woman died of mysterious circumstances not three    Are you questioning my integrity?    I asked you to keep an open mind.    There is something here, Agent Doggett.  And I'll admit that it's hard to    Trevor.  Trevor, I'm Dana Scully...    Your father's in the house.  I'm going to take...       Trevor.    Sir, I am so sorry to bother you again.  I know this has been a terrible ordeal.    I need to speak with your son, Trevor, again.    Well, Trevor told me that he saw a man... It was just something that doesn't    Thank you.       Scully.       What?    I'm sorry, just hang on one second.       Agent Doggett what do you mean he's not there?    Oh, thank god.    Quinton, what's the matter?    Who?  Trevor?    Okay, don't move.  Stay where you are.    I can't.       I shot a young boy.    But it's what I saw.  With my eyes, anyway.  Do you know what it's like not    Because it's what the boy saw.  And in an instant I realized that it's what    Because that's just how he came at things... without judgment and without    No...  it did.  In some way, it did. Yup. All year. Since you always made us take the Christmas tree That's okay, Mom, I got that. Thanks, Mom. Yup. It's good. Well, drive carefully. Goodnight, Daddy. Dad? I thought you guys left. Mom? What's the matter? Last time you were that engrossed, it turned out you were reading "Dana." I'm fine, thank you. What are you working on? They were kept alive, tortured through that period. That's a grim deadline. How is he related? Or the kidnapper. His talents? Mulder, do I detect a hint of skepticism? So you believe that Boggs is orchestrating the kidnapping from And they've requested you speak with him? Why you? I'll go with you. I need to work.  Okay. As a captain, he was entitled to burial at Arlington with full I know that you and Dad were... disappointed that I chose the No. It's my father. I'm sorry, I'm sorry... Did Boggs confess? I lied to the police about how I found the warehouse. I didn't It was where Boggs said it would be. I didn't go looking for it! I came across an area that had landmarks I thought it would be a better explanation under the circumstances. I thought that you'd be pleased that I opened myself to extreme I love this job. Incredible! They found them? I don't understand, why didn't the police notify us? Go. Mulder, it's you. Mulder... even if he is setting us up, we have to follow because And then a day later, our only connection to the case will be Sweep the docks! Mulder! We need an ambulance... officer down! He's reliving it. That would explain the deadline. You set us up. You're in on this with Lucas Henry. This was No! No, I do not believe you! That could be a moment from any kid's life. I'll believe you... if you let... me talk to him. It may be a cold dark place for you but it's not for Mulder I don't believe you. Guard! There's still no sign of Lucas Henry or Jim Summers. The Raliegh Mulder, I never thought I'd say this... but what if there's All right, Mr. Boggs... you got your deal. Alright, where are they? Luther, if you really were psychic... Federal agents, we're armed! Drop your weapon. Go! I believe... that if you had orchestrated this kidnapping, Lucas I was considering Boggs. If he knew that I was your partner, "Beyond the Sea" was playing at my parents' wedding. Visions I'm afraid. I'm afraid to believe. But I do know. He was my father.       From Space, it seems an abstraction-- a magician's       Or will the mystery be revealed through a sign, a      Dr. Solomon Merkmallen, Professor of Biology,    … elsewhere... in this universe.    Yeah.   It's the idea that Mars or other    Well, almost any scientist would... theoretically. I mean, it's       Much less plausible.    And what was it supposed to say?    Well, why don't we?    What are we doing, Mulder?  This is a police matter at best.    Are you going to try and convince me that you have no personal    Oh, come on.    Two men suggesting that we're all Martians.  Now why would they      I don't understand you, Mulder.  You're    Mulder?  Did you hear a word of what I just said?    No?    Well, maybe you didn't want to hear it.    Mulder... look, after all you've done, after all you've    Guess I was right about this being a police matter.  Detective?    Agents Mulder and Scully with the FBI.  What do you have here?    Any word on this Dr. Sandoz?    Told by whom?      Capable of murder?    Are you, uh, speaking of this?       Mulder?    What is it, Mulder?    Do you have a fever?    You're not kidding.    It's just a    You're late.    I called Chuck as I knew you would for authentication, and to get    Is it happening right now?    Because the rubbing is a fake and I'm not the first one to say so..    And the fact that it was found in Africa makes it all the mores    Well, that's what someone would have you believe this is.    As it turns out neither of us had to go very far to find out.    Barnes documented Sandoz's fakery once before.  If he was blunt    Well, it's quite scholarly, actually.    Mulder, if it were real then why would an American Indian artifact    It was from outer space.    Mulder?  Hey.    Let's step outside.   Step outside.    You're in pain.    Mulder, whatever is causing this I think it needs immediate    Mulder, you're not okay.  If nothing else, you should be at home    You had a sense of it?    Well, I hope you're not going to suggest that we arrest him on    We'll come get you to  …    Well, I think I know who he was going to see.    Your World War II code-talker    Or write them.  Mulder, you also said that we'd find a body.  Care    No. Why?    Oh, God.    Parts of his body were missing-- his arms, his hands, uh, parts of    On Agent Mulder's urging I ran tissue samples through what's    I don't know how to explain it but I feel that we can make an    Mulder, let's go.    Mulder, you're losing it.    Mulder, you need to see a doctor.    I'll find the artifacts.  You need to go home right now.    Yes, I was looking to speak to Mr. Hosteen.    Yes, I understand.  I saw him wheeled out of here in an emergency..      I, um, I know him.  He's helped me in the    Hey!    Okay... I need answers from you.    But then other pieces surfaced.       A passage from the Bible on an    And, uh, this was going to tell us what?      Hello?  I'm sorry.  I'm trying to reach Fox Mulder.      Mulder, where are you?      Where?  Who answered the phone?      I'm in New Mexico, with, uh, with Dr. Sandoz.         Mulder, this, uh, artifact if I'm to believe      It has a passage on it from Genesis.      Mulder, it can't be.      No, it would mean nothing, Mulder.      Mulder, that is science fiction.  It doesn't hold a      Mulder, I will not accept that.  It is       It began with an act of supreme violence--  a big    No, I, uh, I don't think that's right.  I don't share in their    I know.  I think they have.    I'm sorry.      Scully.       I'm with Dr. Sandoz.      In Gallup, New Mexico.  Where are you?      What happened to him?    I have to go.  I have to leave.       They just told me he's in the special psychiatric    No, you said that there was bad news.  You didn't tell me what was    What?  What is it?    What's wrong with him?  This man right here, Fox Mulder?    Waiting for what?    I want to talk to him.       Not to me.       About what?    When we took this case... when Skinner gave it to us.    Investigation into a murder.    I never sent you that report.    Why were you with him last night?    You're a liar.    You're both liars.      Hello.      Dr. Sandoz, I-I don't know if this is a secure line.      What they are?    For what?    Yeah.       Dr. Sandoz?  Hello?      Dr. Sandoz? I was wondering when you'd get to that. Several anomalies were discovered in post-mortem analysis that I'm sorry, Mulder, he's right. I'd love to tell you that I flew Yes, but you are proof that it wasn't from exposure to L.S.D.M. Sure. You mean like... sex and ice cubes in liquor in ice cube ads? And how is this connected with the spraying? I'm still waiting. By who? Mulder, I was wrong. Exposure to the insecticide does induce Controlled by who? By the government? By a corporation? By Reticulans? Yes, but why, Mulder? Why would they intentionally create a This is odd. Door's unlocked. Here it is. Nothing. I mean, he hasn't seen a doctor in decades. Get the uniforms out of sight. We'll have to wait him out. Nothing. Scully. Hello? Mulder, is that you? Mulder, where are you? Mulder? You said there was one witness, a little girl. What did Well, it stands to reason that somebody ... Was he depressed or under psychiatric care of any kind? You don't really think the girl had anything to do with it, Do you have any idea how your daughter might have gotten And Mrs. Dougherty is? What seems to be the problem? How do you mean? Frightens you how? Tell me. Your husband? Where is he now? It's beautiful. Wait a minute. We have an autopsy at 7. Why? Are you saying Michelle possesses the ability to Note postmortem examination is being conducted 11 I just started the autopsy.  Will you, uh, take a couple for scale, Looks like a match. Do you know him? Where is he now? Has he been transferred? He was killed in Chinatown - gangland style, allegedly by "Could have been" being the operative phrase. Now, I'm Because sometimes ... ... looking for extreme possibilities makes you blind to the This is the face that Michelle Bishop saw. She walked Yeah, I have what's been declassified. Why? Yes, I told you. It was a signature hit. His arm was severed just below the shoulder, presumably Yeah, this won't take long. Detective, we're under the direct authority of Captain Did you know the detective? Sir, would you mind ... Sure. Did you notice her hands? He said she was sleeping, but her hands were dusted We don't know. All we know is that your daughter has Is there anything that you haven't told us? Is there Well, this police station has a designated room at the Four cops. Their only connection being a drug bust in Chinatown Well, for one thing Fiore said he only knew Barbala by I don't know. There's a page gone from Morris' homicide file. Should be. Yeah. (she reads from the log sheet on the Mrs. Fiore, we're sorry for the early hour, but is your Does your husband have any family or close friends in Mrs. Fiore, did your husband ever mention a detective by Not Charlie Morris, Tony's ex-partner? Do me a favor, Mulder. Let me say it. Reincarnation. All based on the coincidence that Michelle Bishop and So what, you think he's back like Peter Proud to avenge That still doesn't explain how an eight-year-old girl can So where does that leave us? They just left. I know. Mrs. Bishop won't go for that, not in this lifetime anyway. How? And to what end? I mean, what exactly do you We'll find the truth when we find Fiore. What I saw was some traumatized little girl who for no Mulder ... OK. Let's just say that, by some small miracle, you Which means? How is that possible? Pathologists are paranoid by nature. Great.  Apparently, Charlie Morris did not die Um-hmm. That's right. Suggesting that he was killed in The marked bradycardia. That indicates a raised plasma Mulder, what is it? Right. So? Mulder!    This is where the body was found?    Testimony concerning what?    And you think that someone made good on these threats?    It's almost as if his flesh has been stripped or eaten away.  I mean, an    I'll get right on it.    Well, the tissue damage on Dr. Scobie's mouth extends all the way down his    No, that's not the case.  There's no acids present, no caustics.  This damage    Hypoxemia.  The, uh, inability to transfer oxygen from the lungs to the    A bug?    I didn't find anything like that, Mulder.  Were you expecting me to?    Oh... Well, judging from the condition of the body, I'd say that he died in the    What could Morley Tobacco have against a transient from Massachusetts?    It's a long shot, Mulder, but it could be some form of contagious agent, like    And the only thing I have to go on medically at this point is Mulder's bug.    Hmm. What are the differences?    What if such deviations arose from genetic engineering?    No. I was thinking about another possibility
 "Transgenomics."    It's a form of DNA manipulation-- alterations made on the genetic level.    Which possibly could have created super bugs.  I guess the real question is    Thomas Gastall's left lung and bronchus.    Hey, Mulder.  Where have you been?    Well, take a look at this.    They're the larval stage of the tobacco beetle, Mulder and somehow, they    The larvae must pupate inside the lungs and then once they mature into    Mulder?    They're using a deep-suction technique that's been designed for asthma and    For every one of those things that are in his lung tissue there may be a dozen    His pulmonary tissue is riddled with them and they're going to hatch.  It's    I'm thinking he inhaled them.    Well, the tobacco beetle lives out its life cycle on or around the tobacco    Right-- like spores or pollen, somehow small enough to be airborne.    Maybe they were around someone who was.    How do you feel?    We're looking for someone who may be able to help you-- a Morley test    Yeah.  Mr. Weaver seems to have some kind of tolerance or immunity and    Mulder...    Doctor!    His SAT's down to 72.  Get some O-2 on him and call the Code.    There's more now than there were six hours ago.    No.  No, I...  He's too weak for thoracic surgery.  He-he'd die on the table.       I'd say for the time being, we just wait.    Not good.  Let's get the blood work on this man.    Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Get me 30 milligrams of methyl pyrrolidinyl    Yeah.     I think this could save Mulder's life.    Hey.  Good to be back?    Well, you'll be interested to know that Morley Tobacco has subpoenaed all    He's, uh, well enough to have been moved to the hospital ward at Raleigh    Well, his fingertips were stained yellow with it.  He was a four-pack-a-day    Well, once we loaded your system up with enough of it, it acted as a sort of    You're not going to start smoking.    Mulder...    Good.   Well, Skinner's waiting for us in his office.    Anything?    Yeah.  Well, I hope you realize there's no evidence whatsoever    Though her wardrobe comes close.    … and twice they came up empty-handed.       Well, I hope we catch her, so she can tell us before       Mulder...       Mulder, please tell me I can go home.       Well, the furnace broke and I can just about see       That... and I've witnessed a couple hundred things       But as of yet, no mystery woman.       Yeah, well not before I die of malnutrition.       I'm sorry. What?       Mulder, when you find me dead, my    It's a freak show, Mulder.  It's a nonstop       It's not the same, trust me.       Are you talking about a reprieve for me?       That van is back.       Nothing, Mulder.  I'll talk to you later, okay?       Mulder?  I am free.       Mm-hmm.  I'm going to go home, take a shower for,       Yes, except it's not an X-File, Mulder.       Oh, no, we caught her, but she isn't a serial killer       What I'm talking about is the six missing prostitutes    Exactly.  A wolf in sheep's clothing or I guess, in this case, a  Scully.  Mulder, I thought we had an agreement.  Mulder, I’m on vacation. The weather  Why?  Mulder, I’m hanging up. I’m turning Sir … Sir, what happened? I’m .. my name is Scully. I’m an FBI agent.  Mulder, it’s me.  I am. I’m up in Maine.  I don’t … I mean, I do.  I, uh … I’m at a market here. I’m  Well, I’m not quite sure how to describe  Toward themselves.  Yeah. Beating at their  Self-inflicted, it appears.  No, I don’t think it’s witchcraft,  Like evidence of conjury  … familiars, bloodstones,  Yes?  I was hoping for something  Thanks anyway. (hangs  Who’s that woman right She’s the only one I’ve seen who looks unaffected. You might want to talk to her. Yes. I’m on vacation. Why? How’s that? Well, that’s not the first time for that accusation Look, to be honest with you, Captain Bonsaint, um, But now you’re not convinced? What one thing is that? Who she’s been carrying on with? Back door’s wide open. Chief? Take a look at this. It looks like she was afraid of something. You know her? Mm-hmm. The daughter’s autistic? Slapped her? What for? The little girl did? This ah, this affair that the mother was having So, it was unrequited. To the extent that she’d have to nail her windows Like what? Miss Froelich, my name’s Dana Scully. I’m So, I just am helping out the chief here. Who? New England hospitality. Heard about This family tree of Melissa Turner’s... It’s all talk, isn’t it? Well, I think you need to bring her in to straighten That she might know something. Well, about what I’m sure is a perfectly reasonable Well, I wish I could help you out. You With what?  Hello?  Mulder?  Needed your help on what?  I was up and out this morning.  What’s that noise?  A scientific explanation?  Dancing sickness.  Yeah, and  Mulder?  Thanks for the help. Yep.  No. You know, Chief Bonsaint – Jack – can I call Well, maybe we need to keep our minds open to … Oh, my god! That looks like something I’ve been thinking about Melissa Turner. Now, you said Well, was there anything strange about that? How’s that? Was Melissa ever questioned about that? I saw that man at the market. You were on board the night that he died. People’s stories change. Who do you blame? And you know what killed him. But you saw something in that grocery store. That  Scully  Then why’d you call?  Mulder, are there any references  Um, like a doll, for instance.  Yeah, kind of like that.  I was just curious.  No, no. Of course not. Let’s go talk to Melissa Turner. Unh-uh. Melissa? Melissa? Bonsaint!  She’s got the door nailed shut. Melissa! Melissa! Melissa! Put it down, Melissa.  Give me the doll, Polly, give me the doll. I feel fine. That poster … Where’d you get it? Hmm. No. I just … wanted to send one to somebody. Mm-hmm. Oh, just … some guy.  Jack. What case? Uh, yeah. Yes it does. Me? No. No. I was, uh, I Oh, I don’t know. I think some things are Hello? Merry Christmas! You're huge.   This is the exact same layout as our old house. Mom?  You okay? Bill?   Scully residence... Yes, sorry, who is this? Who... who is this?   This is Special Agent, Dana Scully.  My badge number is 2317616. Can you transfer Scully, FBI.  Can you tell me what's going on here? I received a phone call from this address.  It was a woman's voice.  She said that About 20 minutes ago. Please, can you tell me what happened here? I thought it was a dead woman, just not the one in there. I know it's not possible, Bill, but it sounded just like her. Our sister... Melissa. What was their explanation? Excuse me.   Nothing.  Mom, I'm very happy for Bill and Tara. Oh, Mom. Several months ago, I learned that as a result of my abduction, of what they It's okay.  I just never realized how much I wanted it until I couldn't have it. Who is this?  Why are you doing this? Mr. Sim, my name is Dana Scully.  I'm sorry for your loss and I'm sorry to disturb you I received a phone call less than an hour ago.  I was addressed by name and told that I This is the second time this has happened, and I'd really like to get to the bottom of it. Yes. I understand. I'd like everything you have on the Roberta Sim case. Whatever you call it, I'd appreciate seeing everything that you have.   In the It says here that your precinct visited the Sims before.  Two weeks ago.  A domestic They ran a tox screen? It says they turned up high levels of doritriptan. I'd like to borrow this.  She's adopted.   Danny, it's me, Dana... What?   Some of it.   Just some unfinished business. I've got a little work to do.  Can I join you guys later? I'll... I'll rent a car. I'd like to order an autopsy on Roberta Sim.  There's a possibility she was murdered. I think that it may have been the husband. No.  Thanks. I took another look at the police photos this morning.  There were no hesitation cuts No.  Why was the phone off the hook when you got to the Sim's house? Your report says the husband called the police after he discovered his wife dead. But if the phone was off the hook when you arrived, how did he call you? Did he find I am suggesting that there are questions that beg for further investigation.  Order an Stomach contents appear to include coffee, whole wheat toast and cantaloupe. No Then why didn't it show up in her stomach? No. I don't believe absorption would be that complete, not that close to her death. On the heel of her right foot.  Extremely tiny and easy to miss. It was meant to be I say it justifies opening a murder investigation. Mr. Sim, where is your daughter now? We'll check that out.  I want you to analyze Mom... sit down.  The woman who committed suicide has an adopted It means, that this little girl Emily... is Melissa's daughter. You can't deny that there is a remarkable resemblance. Mom, it's uncanny.  Emily looked exactly like Melissa. That's why I ordered the PCR There's a 60% chance that Melissa is Emily's mother. I'll order a more comprehensive Mom, remember about four years ago and Melissa took off? She traveled up and down That was 1994.  Emily was born that November. She could have given it for adoption Mom, this has nothing to do with what I'm going through. I'll be right down. Not a problem. What? From where? Dr. Calderon?  I'm Agent Dana Scully with the FBI, this is Detective You knew Mrs. Sim? What were you treating her for? What's her prognosis? Then why were the checks made out to her mother? She wanted to pull Emily from the program? Dr. Calderon, did you ever prescribe doritriptan injections to Emily during her Where's Emily? Lets get you right in there.  Lets get you buckled in here nice What's up? What do you mean? I did. We did. Yes, I do. It does not matter where that phone call came from.  What matters is that there is a Bill, I don't expect you to understand but I am not going to stand here and justify my Hello? He admitted to being in the house that morning? What about the witnesses who said they saw him in the doctor's office at the time of Maybe they weren't. Where is he now? Did they identify themselves? How long were they here? Just now. Marshall Sim, Emily's adoptive father is dead. They made it look like a suicide, just No. I think it might. Bill, that doesn't prove anything.  Melissa didn't have to be pregnant to have a baby. What dream? Hi. Thanks for coming in on Christmas Eve. I don't understand. I mean, I think I have a right to know why you're rejecting my Well, it's one I've given a great deal of thought to. I mean, to be honest, I've started to I realize that.  And I feel like I'm ready. Merry Christmas.  Melissa? I couldn't sleep.  I guess I'm afraid of making a big mistake.  I could tell Dad sure thinks I am.  I know that. You know, when I God! You sound like a greeting card. I don't believe in fate. I think we have to choose Which is what? Merry Christmas.  (She opens the package and stumbles to the living room. The others It's the DNA test on Emily Sim's blood. It says, definitely, that Melissa is not Emily's mother, but that they found striking According to this... I am Emily's mother.       Ed Truelove was 19 when he committed his first    I'm talking about your sister.  (MULDER sits up and stretches    Do we know each other?    Mr. Piller, are you part of this investigation?    You're a police psychic.    Mr. Piller, you have some interesting references here.  You've,    And did you recover them?    Thank you, Mr. Piller, but we have real work to be done.    Please excuse us.    Mulder...  Mulder, please.    Mulder, you have been through so much in such a short time --    Yes, but this man isn't going to help us find her by his own    Because it's foolproof, Mulder.  Nobody is going to disprove it if    Like your sister.  Mulder...  You told me that all you wanted was    Well, then I'm going back to Washington.  There's nothing more to    Suspicious of what?    Compensatory for what?    You mean his sister wasn't abducted.    But why alien abduction?    So what do you think happened to his sister?    You think that his sister's dead?    Someone owes it to Mulder.    Well, this particular wound has never healed.  And Mulder       Mulder, it's me.  I found something, and I'm standing       I don't know if you know this but there was a special       Well, I'm in your mother's house and I found a piece       This is the document that effectively calls off the       C.G.B. Spender.  The Smoking Man.  He was involved       Mulder, you told me you believe that he's the man       You don't want to press him?    Hello?       You can start by putting out that cigarette.    All but why you can't just come to the door and knock.    You're sick.    What do you want?    You've wanted that since 1973... when you ordered an end to the    Why not?    You're a liar.  If you knew that she was dead why didn't you say    So you just let Mulder believe that she was alive for all these years.    When did you come up with this story, Mulder?  Because yesterday,    Mulder ...    Mulder, I spoke to him.  The Smoking Man, C.G.B. Spender,    Mulder, why would he lie now?  I mean, think about it.    Oh, he led you, Mulder.  He led you from the moment that he    That's not all, Harold.  Your history of mental illness.  You were    Well, whoever's lived here hasn't lived here in a long time.    What do you mean?       Oh, yay.  A seance.  I haven't done that since    How will we know?    Mulder?  What are you doing?    What is?    Mulder?    Let's get out of here.    Go get some sleep.    I got it, Mulder.  I couldn't believe it when I saw it.  It was like    The description matches your sister.    Mulder, it's almost noon.    Maybe she went by another name.  She could have given them    Her medical examination is normal.  Her mental state -- it says       "Diagnosis of condition incomplete... tests unavailable."    Mulder, wait.    That was 1979.  It was 21 years ago.  I don't even know where to    What's wrong?    Are you ready for it?    Do you want me to go talk to her myself?    Okay.       Arbutus Ray?    Are you the same Arbutus Ray that worked as a nurse at the    I'd like to ask you about a patient you treated... a 14-year-old girl.    So you saw her dead?    What do you mean?    So they took her?    Mulder, where did you go?    Mulder, what happened?  Are you sure you're all right? No, nobody does anything without a reason. We've already composed Well, there's a possible connection with all of his victims I can't take you anywhere. It's too bad about your "negative energy," Mulder, you missed He said the killer doesn't feel in control of his own life but Might as well go home, Mulder, this case is as good as solved. Who found the body? According to the police report, Mister Bruckman, you didn't But you reported that you found a body with its eyes cut out. Mister Bruckman, how much have you heard about the recent slayings How did you know about the entrails? That information hasn't I don't blame you, Mister Bruckman. This guy's performing the same routine as the Stupendous Yappi, Oh, so now you're psychic? So you can see into him but not at him. Is he raping her? Mulder, the human mind naturally seeks meaningful patterns and Yes, it looks like a fat, little, white Nazi stormtrooper but Mulder, that only implies that he was the one who put her in I don't believe he's psychic. Maybe he's just lucky. I was told you were interrogating a suspect but something tells Try reading this. It was found on the woman that was pulled from the lake. Identical As far as I know, that's correct. In any case, we're trying to get a hold of him. You get used to it. You prognosticated Buddy Holly's death? Well, Mister Bruckman, I'm not one who readily believes in that Where's the body? Yes, yes, we do. Can you see him physically yet? What? What do you see? Who's it from? He must've been at the crime scenes, seeing you with us. Studying background checks. This is what detective work is really It's something you haven't explained. Can you see your own end? Mister Bruckman... there are hits and there are misses. And So, Ahab mistakes the prophecy and as a result, dies. A similar That must be Mulder. Time for the midnight shift. Chantilly lace? Mulder, it's not likely that the killer was wearing anything It's a coincidence. That's one to pose to the psychic philosopher. Good night, Mulder. Mulder, there's... are you okay? Havez is going to stay with Bruckman while we go over to a tarot Actually, I'm starting to feel more sympathetic towards him. Well, no, not really. But I am convinced that by thinking he can see the future, he's Mulder, I found another strand of that silk. It's the bellhop. Havez? Drop it! I didn't. I got on the service elevator by mistake. You know, none of Bruckman's prophecy came true. The killer Actually, I don't know. I couldn't find him. "My neighbor, Mrs. Lowe, passed away last night. Please see An Agent Mulder was brought here tonight? I'm a federal agent! There's no time for this. I'm Dana Scully, I'm Agent Mulder's partner. What are his vitals? No... you've got to get him out of the tub. You've got to listen to me! If you keep him in there, you're I was just down the street. Someone fired more shots at the What are you working on? Sent by whom? Why? Sounds like the work of militant right-to-lifers. Why would somebody send them to you? What did you find? Triplets? What? What about the man you arrested, this, uh, preacher? Would you recognize his face? I've got a bad feeling about this case, Mulder. Well, nothing about it makes sense. We've got three deaths of You don't even know who sent you that information. I mean, we've More victims? There's twenty four messages responding to the ad. The first Mulder, it's me. I'm at home. What? Have you checked your e-mail this morning, Mulder? Because I received something unsettling and I wondered if you'd It's a digitally scanned photograph. There's another one, Mulder. He's right here in Washington. Who are they? Are you saying these men are clones? If you've known about this for a year, why hasn't anything been Who? Agents Scully and Mulder, we're with the F.B.I. May we come in, Doctor Dickens? I'll call the paramedics... I'll call you back. Okay... Where? How are you feeling? Maybe we should've dropped this case when you were told. Our friend from the C.I.A. is about as unbelievable as his story... Why would a man with his experience need our help... and how Paranoid. Have you stopped to consider that maybe it was Agent Damn it, Mulder, that is not my job. An F.B.I. agent died because of our pursuit of this case. I have to show you something. An autopsy bay? There's no penetrating knife or gunshot wounds. No ligature Well, there's evidence of polycythemia, excessive production Extremely. The doctor who made this report has it in here that Possibly a coagulating agent introduced into the body, but it I don't know, Mulder, I... there was a doctor's bag I took as Well, Skinner's going to want to know why you didn't file your I didn't find anything much to go on but we've got an address. Where you going? Mulder, it's me. I need to talk to you immediately. I've got Mulder, it's me. I just left my aparment and I don't think I've Wait. Put you hands against the wall... now. Sir... These men are to be held in maximum security protective custody. I'll let you know when I figure it out myself. I'd like a single for one night, please. Who is it? Where've you been? Sioux City, Iowa. That's the first I've heard of I don't understand. He must have more evidence than.. I admit, that is strange. Even for Mulder. An X-File. She was his sister, she disappeared twenty-one years ago, In my opinion, no. With respect sir, at least let me talk with him, and make It just doesn't seem, substantial enough to warrant an Well, at least if we had a legitimate source, we could.. But what makes this case anymore credible, than...(Scully Oko-what? Is that supposed to mean something to me? Define hotspot. The pilot took that photograph? Lisa Tyrell, Bonnie Winston, Dorreen McAllister, Darlene Miss Darlene Morris?  Hmmm. Miss Morris, during the divorce, was there a custody battle? How can you be so sure? I just think it's a good idea not to antagonise local You never know, we might need his help one of these days. That's right. Who are you? Are you a friend of Ruby's? And she liked to hang out with you? Do you know what they were planning to do about it? You know Greg from School? This is the motel we'll be staying at if you hear of anything. What? Mulder, they're NSA.  Well how did Kevin obtain top secret information? And, What is it? And none of the information is actionable? So it's just a random set of ones and zeroes. I don't understand. That's from the Brandenburg concertos. This has been a terrible mistake. And I assure you I thought we were headed back into town. (Mulder shakes The key to what? Agent Atsumi said it was a statistical aberration. Ok, I admit it, it's not much of an explanation but it.. A conduit. But how? Mulder I know what you're thinking. I know why this is Just a stones throw from the forest wall. Meaning anybody could've come out of the forest to grab Or an electrical storm. (Mulder is looking through Mulder, look. Mulder what are you doing? (Mulder continues to You ok Mulder? Ruby's boyfriend. Look at that, it's her, the girl from the library. We didn't get her name but she claimed Greg and Ruby had Have a seat Tessa. (Tessa sits down and the door We can prove it Tessa, and we can prove that Greg, was This is very serious. Do you understand how serious You said that he and Ruby were seeing each other. Mulder you're not seeing the whole picture here. Which is that all likelihood, Ruby is dead. They're searching the national park and a rescue dive Do you really think Tessa Seers is telling the truth? She lied to us in the library, she lied to us about her We have a suspect in custody, we have a confession to Mulder where are you going? Darlene won't even let you in the door. They don't wanna have anything to do with you...us. Kevin? (Mulder notices something on the floor and I'm gonna check upstairs. (Scully goes upstairs Just come up here.  This is a longshot Mulder, they could be anywhere. Look, there's a trail ahead. Go ahead. MULDER! She's unconcious but she's still alive. Nurse says she been awake for almost an hour. Eerrr, there's no sign of head trauma, no narcotic traces Errmmm, actually both, how did you know that? Hi.  Hi Ruby. Ooh, we're with the FBI, I'm Special Agent Dana Scully How are you feeling? You're right, we should wait until Ruby gets a little Both eardrums are ruptured. Cataracts over both eyes. Well, there is extensive charring along the sternum with Did you find contact wounds on any of the other five victims? Are you aware that something like 60 people die from Yes, I’m Agent Scully.  These Yes, I know a little. No, I didn’t know that. I don’t understand. I didn’t know that either. With all due respect, sir, these autopsies don’t quite add up. Based on my opinion as a medical doctor. Well, since there is no other explanation right now, I’d  Feel free to jump in anytime.  Do you have a theory on what’s going on here? Mulder, wait. What are you expecting to find here?  Could you stop for a second, please? Well, what are you looking for? I mean, just because a The only possible scientific conclusion is that Jack What are you talking about? Police found Hammond in his car at 17 minutes past Get away from what?  Sometime between 11
00 and 11
30. Excuse me. What’s your name? Zero, do you mind if we talk for a minute? I’m with the FBI. Were you working here last night? Do you recognize this person? Why don’t you take a closer look. He was here between Before the ambulance showed up did you notice anything Did you notice anyone else around who might have seen What?  Uh… Corey Huffard, Darren Peter. Why? Yes. Mulder. What’s in your pocket? What happened? What happened here, Sheriff? Did they report lightning last night? Mulder, I’d have to say I think he’s right. Well, look at the evidence. What else could it be? Here we go. Well, considering it’s a partial imprint  The tread looks Well, it says it right here on the bottom. But I may have something even better. When I was I’d have to conduct a chemical analysis to be sure, But why? And how? Mulder … We’ve got a size match. Yeah, but it still doesn’t prove that he killed Jack I’m surprised you haven’t already read that issue. Who is she? Mm-hmm. there’s a yearbook in Darren’s closet. Her name is Sharon Kiveat. I just talked to one of the EMS workers. Frank Kiveat’s electrocardiogram.  See that He didn’t. All he saw was Darren Oswald touching  He was admitted to the ER five months ago A severe chemical imbalance characterized by high Yeah. Well, among other things they generate the electrical Our body doesn’t work like that … You’re saying he’s some kind of lightning rod?  We just want to talk to you, that’s all. Why did you run when you saw us? We’re not so sure. Not much. Except that he’s a hero. CPR. He claims he paid attention in health class. How? By causing Kiveat’s heart attack? So what? Are we supposed to charge him with assaulting Mulder, look where we are. We don’t have the capability Is it okay if we come in? How would you describe your relationship with him? Did you get him the job at your husband’s garage? How did you know it was Darren? Well, you don’t have to be afraid any more. You and I believe that Darren Oswald was involved somehow in In effect. You said yourself, Sheriff, not even science can explain She’s on her way to the hospital. Sharon? We need you to come with us right away. Look, we don’t have much time. Come with us and we’ll Sharon, please. He’s dead. How many other access points to this floor? Mulder!  Darren, don’t move. I said don’t move. Darren. Stop. I’m warning you. I want you step back inside that room. She’s not going anywhere with you, Darren. I can hurt you too. I’m going to give you three seconds. Sharon, we can work this all out, right here. I just got off the phone with the coroner. He’s ruling They also reported lightning last night. I talked to the DA. They came in five minutes ago. Nothing unusual was detected, Mulder. The electrolytes, What am I looking at? Right, but what am I looking for? I don’t know, I... I give up, Mulder. Why, what happened to them? Ecoterrorists or militant environmentalists. Do they know why? It appears as if these monkey wrenchers are doing more than For an ecoterrorism case? Do I dare ask why? And you suspect what? Bigfoot? Must be pretty rugged where we’re going, huh? "Freddies?" Do you think they’d go so far as to kill a man? Get the impression that we’ve walked into the middle of a war You’re kidding, right? So how are we going to get up to the camp? Looks like they left in a hurry too. Somebody really turned this place upside-down. Well, you were right about one thing. It definitely wasn’t Bigfoot. What is it? Got it. Yeah, I think so. Oh God... No, more like all the fluids have been bled from this body. What kind of an insect could have gotten a man all the way up When who comes? We found something in the forest. That’s the man you said that was devoured alive?  What do you think? Who marks these trees? You must get a lot of lumber from a big tree like this. Those center rings are the older rings, right? That’s what we’re trying to determine, sir. Why not? Can you identify them? Well, they appear to be hatching out of the porous wood. Maybe You think these mites are what killed the men? These bugs aren’t moving anymore. They’re either dead or they’re That’s weird, I mean, usually bugs are attracted to light. Uh, just what I learned in my biology courses. That they’re Yeah, something like 600 million years, even before the dinosaurs. Well, like what, exactly? Yeah, but how does that explain the bugs? Oh, a brain-sucking amoeba. But an amoeba is a single-celled organism. It can be mutated. It’s working? What about transmissions, could we send a message? What do you mean? What about the gas in the trucks? Well, then we’ve got to get back on the radio, we’ve got to Mulder... Fine. What do you suggest? Look, I think we both have a pretty good idea of what happened It’s a big forest. You mean, would I have made a decision by myself that would Well, what do you want me to say? Let’s face it, Mulder, we What are you going to do? I can see them. You guys, look at this. Get them off me! Can you see them? Mulder, get them off me! I thought we were supposed to be safe in the light! I’m okay. And then what? It’s over a day’s hike out of here. We won’t Oh, you sent that call hours ago. I mean, help would have been And if he doesn’t?      Where's Mulder?   No...  no …     No...!!!!!      He was the last.  His father and mother... his sister... all gone.  I think the          I can't truly believe that I'm really standing      I'm fine.  How are you feeling?      A.D. Skinner just called.  He told me about your meeting with Kersh.      You'd be crazy to stay, Agent Doggett.  This is a huge career opportunity      What do you mean?      You don't owe me anything, Agent Doggett.      I heard the same speech come out of my mouth seven years ago.      Get out while you can, Agent Doggett... or you may never get out at all.      Is it true?      No. I want to see him.         No, I need to see him, damn it!        Tell me it's true.  Tell me.      What did they say?      I need to see him.      Nothing.  I was just looking in on the patient and he started to go into grand      No. No, I, uh... the man down the hall was my... is my partner and we knew      You asked me not to come in here, Agent Doggett.  I hope you're not      You mean finding Mulder alive?      Agent Doggett... ...However I felt about you when we first met, you      About what caused this.      Do you have any idea what you're doing here, Billy?  Do you have any      That's not what you mean... is it, Billy?  You mean... a spacecraft.      Agent Doggett...  Where are you going?      You just won't believe it, will you?   Not even for a minute.  Not even with      Agent Doggett, you spoke with his doctors.  He was lying on his deathbed.      I underestimated you, Agent Doggett.  I thought this was just simple...      Hi.      I know.  I'm sorry.      It's too incredible.  Sir, there isn't a piece of medical data on him that isn't      Because it doesn't make sense.  I mean, there should be blood, fluid,      Why are you asking me this?  Sir, if you know something... look, we-we're      Where?      This is about saving a man's life.      Look, I don't have time to waste debating our differences, Agent Doggett.      A virus that seems to keep the body just alive enough to take it through a      Agent Doggett, I don't have time to argue.      He told you this was a virus?      That's it.      How Billy Miles came back so perfectly.  I stood there and watched his      And it'll happen to Mulder if we don't stop it soon.      I need a surgical bay, a team of doctors.  I have to keep Mulder's body      The one I asked AD Skinner to get me.      I don't know.  I... I really don't know how we could've known.      That by keeping him on life support we were incubating the virus.  We      When Skinner pulled Mulder off of the machines, his temperature dropped      If we can stabilize him and his temperature we can give him courses of      Mulder...      Hi.      Oh, my god.  Don't do that to me.      Do you know...?  Do you have any idea what you've been through? Hi. I got your message. It's two-o-clock in the afternoon Agent Mulder. Something you couldn't show me at work. Which was what, exactly? What do you mean? What reason would the military have to kidnap one of their own Yeah, there were rumours those pilots were shot down at high So? I don't get it Mulder. Does this have something to do You ok Mulder? Mulder? I checked on that file you gave me. You failed to tell me a few things. (Mulder hears clicking Did you hear what I said, because the bureau has it out for How do you mean? Did you ever talk to him about this? You know that the government is not above the law. They How long has he been... We'll be staying at the Beech Grove Motel if you anything, ok? Mmm, it's called sterioptathy, it's a syndrome produced by extreme Ever hear of something called The Aurora Project? The Pentagon has all but admitted, they've been testing a secret Yeah, somebody named Colonel Kissel will meet with us, Good thing we still kept that appointment. Sucker. Catch ye outside. Wanna see something weird, Mulder? Ellens Air Base You know. Where are we going? What do you honestly hope to see? Is this why we came out here, Mulder? To look for Aaaaaah! Unnh! What are they? That's unreal. I've never seen anything like it. Well, it can't be aircraft. Aircraft can't manoeuvre I don't know, lasers maybe. Being shot from the That's not a plane, that's a helicopter. So, what exactly were you guys doing in there? What's that? You believe it all, don't you? Mulder, did you see their eyes? If I were that stoned I... Mulder, you could have shown that kid a picture of a flying Mulder, are you suggesting that the military is flying Mulder, c'mon. You've got two blurry photos, one Tell me, one good reason why either of these photos is Just because I can't explain it, doesn't mean I'm gonna Mulder, you're crazy.  And Thanks. You ready for this. We got a message from Mrs. Budahas, her husband came home We got your message. What is it? Mulder, would you explain to me what's going on. The brain doesn't work like that, Mulder. You can't There are types of amnesia th.. All I'm saying, is that the science or medical technology Even if they could, why would they do such a thing? It couldn't just be that he had a nervous breakdown with What the hell is th.. Federal Agents. Nothing under Idaho plate CC1356, no plate registered Something else. What! If, if that were true, it would be a national scandal. Did you ever stop to think that what we saw was simply Look, these are questions we have no business asking. Mulder, where are you going? Yeah, I'm, I'm trying to make a call to Washington D.C. This one's not working either. Thanks. I was in the lobby trying to make a call. Yeah. Get on the car. Hands on the car, do it. I said, hands against the car. Who are you? Where's Mulder? I want you to get on that walkie-talkie and find out where I think you can, or I'm gonna have every newspaper in Yeah, I've already seen where you get with tears and a What are we doing? I want the car running. I said start the car. Yeah, you just keep telling yourself that. I want you to keep the car running, and step out of the You ok Mulder? What? That's enough Mulder.

There's a change of clothes Did you take anything, Mulder? Are you sure you didn't cut yourself? Where's your weapon? Two rounds have been fired. Mulder, I need to get you to a hospital. You have to be examined Mulder, the first thing that you need to do, is to take care No. You checked in alone around noon on Saturday. The manager's You drove. He's got a license number of a car registered. Do There's blood on the steering wheel, Mulder. Car's registered That's what I'm gonna find out, Mulder, but first, I'm checking You are taking a big risk, Mulder. I feel strongly about this. Is this David Cassandra's house? We're with the FBI. Possibly. Is Amy or David reachable in anyway? Mulder, what's up? How? When? Do you know anything else about this house? Where's that? If you've been here, Mulder I don't think it was any time recently. Mulder? Mulder, can you hear me? What happened? You fell to your knees and you grabbed your head, like you What do you mean, what you saw? Do you remember anything else? Your heart is racing. It was some kind of a seizure. Some kind of acute physiological That's what a specialist is going to have to tell you, Mulder. Mulder, you are not really good. What, in your childhood? I don't think anybody's lived here in a long time. Mulder. There's a gunshot wound to her heart. This must be They'd like to ask you some questions. I told them about your Mulder, I refuse to believe that you had any part in this. Agent Mulder's not going anywhere but to a hospital. Mulder, I'd advise you not to say anything more--not until Did you see this? Do you mind? I'm not sure. Do you have a magnifying glass? Thanks. I just Yeah. I think it is, too, but what I'm more interested in right Mulder. I'm going to get you out of here. Did you make a confession? Detective Curtis, before you go through all that trouble, I Medical evidence. The toxicology report on Amy Cassandra indicates Typically, but when ingested by a person, it can cause hallucinations. So, I went down to the hospital to go over agent Mulder's medical Probably injected--there was a bruise from an injection on I don't know, but the presence of such a powerful drug could Mulder, you have to help me out. There is nothing here that You're jailing an innocent man. I'm a doctor. Somebody call the paramedics. He's dead. I need Did this officer have a history of depression or mental illness? How do you mean? Do you see these photos? Does this mean anything to you? Well, I think that it speaks to a pronounced mental illness. Amy Cassandra. Both your officer and Amy Cassandra had identical Yes. I think your officer knew of Amy Cassandra, and somehow Did he say about what? I need to talk to him alone, if you don't mind. [to Mulder] I know that, and I think I've gathered enough proof and evidence The forensics reports. The, uh, the shirt that you were wearing Yes. I think I have an idea about that, too. Amy Cassandra believed Yes... apparently. According to an article I read on Amy, she I can't say definitively, but judging from an almost identical I can't explain that. I've arranged for your arraignment in This is the office of the psychologist that treated Amy Cassandra. It's been here for a few days. Yes. We're investigating the deaths of Amy and David Cassandra. Are you referring to her belief that she was an abductee? Did you also use this treatment on a police officer named Michael Mr. Fazekas shot himself in the head last night. Are you familiar with Waxman-Geschwind syndrome? Did you know Amy Cassandra suffered from it? I know what you do. This man is lying about more than that. I think that he administered Why would you do that, Mulder? Why would you undergo something Mulder? No, I am not going to take that for an answer. You do not belong No, you're not driving. You're not doing anything until these To go where? Okay... but I'm driving. He's undergone a treatment. He believes it's helped him to Where's Mulder? Did you ask Dr. Goldstein? Stop that car! Hey! Open the back door. What did you do to Where is he now? What was the last thing he said to you? Yeah. Is he in there? All right... that man in there is armed. He is a federal officer Mulder? Mulder, it's me. Mulder, Put down the gun. Please, Mulder... Are you going to shoot me, Mulder? Is that how much this means Put down the gun. Let it go. Although cleared of any wrongdoing in the deaths of Amy and Ummm.... I think I went to a constructive problem solving Mulder? Mulder? We’ve got this conference. They’re waiting. You want me to tell them that you’re not going to make it to Since you won’t be making it to the conference .... However, I must remind you this goes against the Bureau’s policy Well, what does that have to do with anything? I thought this was just a ploy to get out of the conference. Mulder, we’re in Western Florida. The closest thing to Where are you going? You know, Mulder, sometimes I think some work on your communication How’s the boy? I think I might have some insight into this invisible creature Right.  Mm hmm. And? Where? That could have been brought in by the dog. Wait a minute. I thought you said it wasn’t human.  You’re putting me on. So, if it’s not man and it’s not animal, what the hell is it? Where was that?  Okay. I get you. Thank you. Why do you say that? But for what purpose? What enemy would that be?

They’re trying to separate us – pull us away from the others. Michelle? Michelle?! Jeez.   Over here! Over here! I don’t know. She was walking right ahead of me. She was right here, What the hell’s happening here? Mulder, he’s right. We weren’t prepared for this.  I don’t have much faith that this device will Whatever it is that we were chasing did show up on the screen Nothing. Except that we’re going in the right direction. Ticks. I’ve heard that they can halt their metabolism Why is that interesting? What would that be filed next to - - "The Cockroach That Ate What do you mean?  Everybody stand still. About 40 or 50 yards out. I saw it. The woods have gone silent again. Talk to him. Talk to him, Jeff! Mulder, it’s not on the screen. I got it.  I don’t know. It just stopped. Six, maybe seven. Yep.

Any evidence to substantiate those Many homicides include victim desecration. More rumours. Any idea who Jerry Stevens was with out here? Well, most people don't set out to drink two six-packs Theories like that are why I can't take him seriously. Mulder, I got the impression you didn't believe him either. I think he incited your imagination. I think this Mulder, toads just fell from the sky!

How can you I am a medical doctor and I would like to see the autopsy Something very strange is going on here, Mulder.

Agent Fox Mulder lost consciousness at  Mmmm. Yeah. Mulder? Where is he? Whatever caused this is still out there. I have to talk to      I'm all a-tingle.

I'm sure he's on his way.    Mulder!    Mulder... Where have you been?    You got lost.    Yeah.    Well, sir...    We were following a lead, sir.    Mulder.  Mulder!    What was that about?    "I'd give you his name if I had it"?  Whatever happened to    What is going on with you?    Mulder, you are acting bizarre.    Mulder!      Scully.      I'm sorry, who is this?      Mulder.      UFO?      Morris Fletcher.      Psst.      Uh... What was what?      Mulder, uh... Where are you?      How can I get in touch with you?    That wasn't your source?  Well, I'll run a trace.    Mulder?  Are you sure that's the best thing to do?       It's me.    What do you think you're doing?      We got the trace back on the call we    And I'm thinking it was your source although I don't know why he'd    You don't think that we should follow up on this?      Am I out of my mind?  Mulder, you    Hi. My name is Dana Scully.  I'm looking for Morris Fletcher.    I'm sorry.  Uh, Morris Fletcher?      You're, uh... You're the man from the other night?  From    You phoned me.  Would you mind telling me what this is about?    Look... Any of that information could have been gathered by anyone.    I don't know what the point of all of this is.    No. You won't, but I wouldn't mind if you came clean with me.    Good-bye, Mr. Fletcher.         Scully.      Uh... Sir, I am...      Sir, I don't know what Agent Mulder might have told    I'm sorry. You did the right thing, Mulder. I've been telling you for years you should play more by the book, He said that I was willful, insubordinate and not a team player and Two-week suspension without pay.    See you in two weeks. Wow. Mulder. I didn't even know you had a bedroom. Uh, no, that's okay.  Thanks. Oh! Mulder...   No, I don't hate it. ,Do you know what would really be fun? You first. You're not Mulder.    "Baby" me and you'll be peeing through a Are you through? Or I just shoot you... Baby. What about Mulder's source?  The man he was supposed to meet in the And? Get going. Mulder?  Is that really you? I'm trying to figure out a way to help you. Open up. We need your help right now.   Who, what, why. I need to know everything that's on that data Groom Lake. Outside Area 51. What's that?

Morris... Get your butt in gear.   Enough.  Call me when you guys have some   That is you in there, Mulder, isn't it?    I, uh... I just got off the phone with Frohike.   Well, that's just it.

Mrs. Fletcher, we have reason to believe that whatever event caused Only we have to be in its path when it happens. Come on, Mulder.  Let's go.      Mulder, it's me.  I just wanted to let you know that we      Mulder, I'm sorry that your confidential source didn't      Good night.      You're welcome. Uh, Virgil Nokes? I'm Agent Scully. This is Agent Mulder. No, sir. Federal Bureau of Investigation. Uh, sir, this is just a routine check but, uh, we understand that Excuse me? Yeah. Well, as we said, sir this is just routine.   Mulder, we're not going to Nevada. No. Sorry, Mulder. We have a whole new assignment.

All right. I want the CDC on-site. I want the officers making What's the report, Captain? How did Crump know to avoid the roadblock? Maybe Agent Mulder steered him away from it. Maybe he knew something that we don't. Anything? No, no. Not necessarily. I mean, something killed these people. Sorry. Excuse me.  Scully.  Yes, sir.  Sir, I am not currently in the state of Idaho.  In the course of prosecuting our assignment in  Thank you, sir.  Can I see that for a minute? What if he read the meter at Vicky Crump's place? Okay, I want a thorough search with an eye to the usual I think we're witnessing the same pathology here. Let's go. Hang on. Let me sedate him. Dogs, housewives...

Let him through.  I'll take that under advisement. Lieutenant Breil? My name is Dana Scully. I called in My Washington office? Oh, I'm...

I'm just about to board a justice department jet...  I don't know, Mulder. You tell me.  Well, I think I have a loose theory as to what  Okay. Mulder, you know what ELF waves are?  Well, Seafarer has an antenna array stretching  What if some overload some... Some hum  I don't know, Mulder, I don't know. I mean...  Well, I think I know, Mulder, but it's nothing Get ready! Sir, Agent Mulder has been through a lot. I'm not apologizing for this. Because of his work, the DOD  Right.  Scully. Yeah, I know. I've been watching it on TV. What's going on out That an escaped mental patient is holding four people hostage Seriously? Mulder? Where's Mulder? What? You've got to get him out of there. No, you've got to get him out of there now or he's going to Because Duane Barry is not what Mulder thinks he is. No, I don't think you understand what I'm telling you. I just All right, well then let me speak to someone who's in charge. Don't tell me to calm down, I'm not going to calm down until I'm Special Agent Dana Scully and I have information that is I think there has been a critical misjudgment here. This man The injury left him nearly incapable of functioning in society. He became a pathological liar, suffering from severe delusions. Agent Mulder called me. We used to work together. Is there a way I can reach him with this information? Mulder? It's me. Listen to me. You cannot trust Duane Barry. Mulder, he could snap at any time. He has a history of irrational That's good, that's good, Mulder. This is the countdown, Mulder, they're coming at you. You okay, Mulder? Whatever you're feeling... you did the right thing. Sometimes when you want to believe so badly, you end up... looking This could just be a piece of shrapnel. Duane Barry did a tour And you think that this was implanted? Or some version of the truth. What do you think? That would make sense. What? Mm-hmm. Looks like some kind of a stamp. Uh, I don't know what happened. Mulder, it's me. I just had something incredibly strange happen. Mulder! I need your help! Mulder! Dr. Dana Scully. I have just been assigned to the Academy as a forensic investigator. For the past eight Sorry to disappoint you, but this is a course in forensic pathology. Hard There is adhesive residue on Mrs. Mountjoy's wrists and face.  Well, there's also evidence of fingerprint bruising along his collarbone. Snakes appeared to be purely symbolic. They're non-venomous species collected locally. They were sewn But there's something else. There's something that you're not saying. I've felt things that I couldn't understand. Things that I was afraid to admit even to myself. I learned not to ignore it... to trust my instincts. It appears he was shot in the chest. His body was staged post-mortem, just like the others. Saint Peter. He was said to have been crucified upside down. I haven't formed an opinion about it yet, actually. The syringes contained roperidol, that's the same anti-psychotic medication that she was giving to Dr. Richmond. You still think that it was Kobold? Agent Doggett, have you considered that something else might be going on here? But I also said that once science fails, we have to consider extreme possibilities. I know what you're feeling. I know your frustration. But you can't let it cloud your objectivity. As far as I can tell physically he's fine. What brought this on? Agent Mulder used to refer to it as psychic plasma - a residual by-product Well, then let's just see how well he plays that game. Agent Doggett. Agent Reyes is just trying to get to the truth, okay? What are you doing? Scully. I'm on my way back to DC. What is it? Where? On state road 710, near Annandale. There-there's old marina there. I passed it on my way home, in fact I'm almost there right now. Agent Doggett, over here. He held me at gunpoint until you arrived and then he shot himself. Uncertainty. Not matter how thorough the investigation, some doubts inevitably remain. Just as juries seek to  I'll see you Monday.  I was going to do it on my way home. But Agent Reyes told me that Kobold accessed information about all of us over the He wanted us on the case, we know that. But we know all this already. It was a game, every move was played out perfectly. Except the last one. What, to get shot in the back? Kobold's dead. Agent Doggett shot him. We all saw that. Satan. Chosen from the phone book. For what reason? And the third victim?  It's not Kobold. Custer. Something still bothering you, Agent Reyes? You don't believe this explanation? You mean that you felt the presence of evil? From the trucker’s description, the shape he fired on could conceivably have been a mountain lion. The National Weather Service last night reported atmospheric conditions in this area that were possibly conducive to lightning. It is feasible that the truck was struck by lightning, creating the electrical failure. And you know, there’s a marsh over there. The lights the driver saw may have been swamp gas. It’s a natural phenonemon in which phospine and methane rising from decaying organic matter ignite, creating globes of blue flame. Mulder, none of that evidence is conclusive. Isn’t it more plausible that an exhausted truck driver became swept up in the hysteria and fired at hallucinations? I mean, after all, the road can play tricks on you. Pardon me for asking, but how long have you had that cough? I’m just concerned, you said you were a veteran. The cough, the fever, the rash. Those are all symptoms of Gulf War Syndrome. Why? Ranheim was sick. Mm-hmm. Mulder, the only UFOs people are likely to see are secret military aircraft. Well, there is a base in Little Rock. You think that’s what the Air Force was flying that night? Possibly. Mulder, the military isn’t going to talk about classified aircraft. Hmm. I think you give the government too much credit. …what makes you think they could plan and execute such an elaborate conspiracy? How can they do that? Hmmm… I’ll check. Hey! This strip is an anti-counterfeiting measure. Those were the most paranoid people I have ever met. I don’t know how you could think that what they say is even remotely plausible. Did you see the way they answered the telephone? They probably think that every call that they get is monitored and they’re followed wherever they go. It’s a form of self-delusion. It makes them think that what they’re doing is important enough that somebody would… The truck is bogus. And so’s the truck driver, Ranheim. First I checked his manifest. It listed a truck carrying 180 cartons of auto parts weighing 3,100 pounds. Then I checked with three weigh stations along his route and they have it listed at 5,100 pounds. There’s something in that truck, Mulder, and it’s not auto parts. And of course, nobody ever reported him. Furthermore, Ranheim lied about being in the Gulf War. His real name is Frank Druce – and I worked hard to get this one. He was Special Operations Black Beret in Mosul, northern Iraq. Also, he didn’t get sick from the encounter the other night. He’s been to the V.A. hospital for treatment three times this past year. Where did you obtain this information? I want to know all about him. How do you know that? We work for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and we’re being bugged. What does that tell you? Exactly. And for all we know, this “deep background” is the one responsible for the bug. Mulder, you’re the only one I trust. Generally. It’s heading west. Towards Colorado. Mulder, this photograph is a fake. Look. Now look closely at the color of the light reflected in the windshield. Now that reflection should be from the red lights in the UFO but it doesn’t match the color of the ship’s light. We should have it analyzed. Well, maybe you’re too determined to believe him. Mulder, listen to me. Please, will you just hear me? Mulder? Are you home? Mul… I think this time you’re right, Mulder. I’d also like a one-way ticket to Los Angeles with a stop at Las Vegas, and I’ll be paying cash. My ear’s numb from being on hold for so many hours. Yep. It’s heading northwest on I-90. Here we go. Yeah. Ranheim? Ranheim? Oh my God. Where’d it go? God, Mulder, I can’t stop shaking. What we just saw – did it fit the profile? But how could anyone generate such force? So they created this elaborate show just to deflect us again. I mean, wouldn’t it have been easier just for them to – Now we have nothing to go on. No one to turn to. The sightings are following the path of the truck. Aliens? We’ve driven full circle through Mattawa twice. There’s nothing here. What’s going on here? This place has got to have the highest level of security. Who? 5-3-1-1. We’re gonna look suspicious going back. Mulder, they’re not going to let us. Mulder, stop. We’re agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mulder, no! Mulder, this happened how long ago? Only the smell. Mulder, you brought me out here A transient. Purple rain? Mulder, this "transient," as you call it, this bright And the victim, Maria Dorantes, did she die in a similar You assume? Nobody’s examined the body? No La Migra, no La Migra.  La FBI, no La Migra. (MULDER El Chupacabra? Who would that be, sir?  Thank you, Mr. Buente. You’ve  Maria ... Maria ... It makes perfect sense, Mulder. Admit it. Mulder, what we’ve walked into here is a Mexican soap Okay, I care, but what are we supposed to do about it? While you do what? Excuse me? Excuse me? I’m Agent Dana Scully with the FBI.  I’m sorry? Uh, a woman named Maria Dorantes. I need to determine Well, I’m a medical doctor. If you show me the body  I don’t Did you find Eladio Buente? Did he confess to the murder of Maria Dorantes? Did he tell you what happened? He didn’t kill her, Mulder. I examined the body Aspergillis, according to the coroner. It’s a mold Not normally. It’s actually very common and quite Well, aspergillis can be lethal to people with immunodeficiencies Mulder, I know you don’t want to hear this, but I think Look at that. Mulder. It appears this man died of systemic shock. Brought on No. It looks dissimilar. I don’t know what No one knows where he ran? Eladio Buente didn’t kill this man. He didn’t kill Mulder, this is the work of a pathogen of - of some kind Mulder, whatever you hope to learn by finding this man Athlete’s foot? But our body has natural defenses against this kind of What’s this? So it’s not the fungi, but the enzyme that kills. Oh, my God.  Mulder, it’s me.  I’m at the state university bio department.  By spreading an enzyme produced by what  My guess is by touch.  He could be just a carrier, then – a  Yes. Mulder, it’s extremely important that you  A bollide?  Mulder, I think this is beside the point,  Mulder, let me work on the fungus, okay? More goats. Maybe you should check the back. There is no El Chupacabra, Gabrielle. Eladio is For what? Eladio Buente? Drop your weapon! Drop it! Put it down! Now!  Mulder. Gone where? You gave him your money? You know, what she said about Eladio Buente, about his Mulder, he could be anywhere right now. If - if If he’s going to Mexico ... Then where is he going? I don’t understand. Yes, sir. We can’t exactly explain it ourselves, sir.  The Haz-mat team were able to contain the And the fungal infection already starting to eat away They were nowhere to be found. Lozano’s revolver It’s not a fungus, sir. Actually, it’s an enzyme Well, sir, they, um...They have a way of being almost What am I looking at? Yep.  This is where you saw the body? And the blood from the victim was pooling where? But both the body and the blood were gone when you returned? Was the same woman that you saw caught up here in the I would have thought that after three years you'd know You're saying that what this man saw was the victim's Which is just another name for a ghost. A death omen? Communicate what? What? (holding up a TV Guide with Jay Leno's picture on the Yeah, I found something here Mulder ... in these photos Yeah. But she wasn't married. No, not at all.  And in all Well, there's something called ego dystonia. It's You really think that the killer is a patient here? Did he cop to making the call? Well ... when you're right, you're right. Harold Spuller suffers from pervasive developmental disorder, You mean what made him snap? Why, I think his outburst Mulder, the man is disturbed. You could see the Why are you now so unconvinced that Harold Spuller is "She is me." Well, I think I have an idea about that if not an explanation. Yeah. It's ok. Yeah, it's just, um, I'm fine. I just need to find a washroom.  Yeah. That would rule out Harold Spuller as the killer, huh? I don't imagine he'd be too hard to find. Mulder ... I ... I think I'm going to let you take care of that. No, no, I'm fine really. I've had the doctors keep I'm fine. This is different. Several months ago, I was diagnosed with a cancerous mass I don't mean for this to sound too dire. My health Yes. It's been important to me. Why? Um ...Agent Mulder has been concerned. He's been supportive  No.  I guess I never realized I saw something. I, I don't know what to trust.  Maybe. I saw a woman who had recently been murdered. I No. No. What are you doing Mulder? On what? I'm fine. What's up, Mulder? How? That's what you need my medical opinion on? I don't understand. How do you know? But you didn't see it yourself? Why? What's Harold Spuller's connection? Oh, wait a minute, so Harold knew the people that were Even if what you're saying is true, Harold wasn't the Which is what? Harold Spuller is dying too? Well, what if he isn't? I'll meet you there. Maybe you were wrong. Then why would he do it? Maybe. We won't know until we can examine him. Is your name Chuck? Do you, uh, do you share this room with Harold? Do you know where he is? Why do you say that? Who told you that? Harold hasn't been taking his medication? Who? Does anybody else know about these pictures, Chuck? How are you feeling? Understandable. Will your family be a comfort? No children? Nurse Innes, I'm afraid I'm gonna to have to ask you to Stay where you are! Drop it! Let it go! She's alive. Let's get a paramedic in here. Yeah, she attacked me. (Mulder starts to pick up She had been taking Harold's meds ... clonazepam Well, I went in to talk to Harold's roommate and he said I don't know. I mean, maybe in some drug-addled I don't know. Have they found Harold? What happened? As a result of what? Well, Harold Spuller wasn't dying, Mulder. He, he I saw something Mulder. The fourth victim. I saw her in the bathroom before Because I didn't want to believe it. Because I don't No, I came down here because you asked me to.  What do you want me to say?  No. The doctor said I was fine.  I'm going home. Emily? I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.  His name is Mulder. Remember, I told She's a little shy. I'll be right back.  Thank You got a name? Fugazzi? I don't understand. Why create a false record? How did she come into this world? Well, she was born to someone, she... she has to belong to someone. I can protect her too. I know... I've considered that, but I've also considered that there's only one right thing Because I couldn't believe it. But I need you now to be a witness on my behalf in this Then why are you here? It takes two of us just to get my sister-in-law into bed these days. Two weeks ago.  Why didn't you tell me, Mulder? Why would they do this to me? Children being created for who? Hello? Hello?  Hello, is anybody Mulder, it's ... She's burning up. Oh, my God.  How is she? Do you know what's causing it? I'm her mother. I know that she was being treated for anemia. I was told that it was some kind of auto immune hemolytic anemia. Her treatment was His name is Calderon. They have her under a mild sedative. How did you know? So what now? She's still just a little girl. You say I can't protect her, but I can't let this He can't do that. He's endangering her life. It's an ethical violation . Well, authority or not, I'm not leaving her side. Can you give me a minute with her?  (The woman nods.  Scully adjusts her mask and We just want you to get better.  That's what these tests are for. I hope you know what this is. Is it cancer? Can you put her on antivirals? No, you can't do that.  Her immune system's too weak. Dr. Calderon? (She rushes to Emily's room and sees Emily laying on her side-stomach What do you mean, you've been following him.  I just saw him.  There was a scare She seems to be, but we're running a tox screen anyway. (She walks down the hall as What are you talking about?  Mulder, that doesn't make any sense.  Why would he endanger her before only to Detective. Thanks for coming down. That might not be necessary. There seems to be some indication that he came here to help her. Because Emily's mother wanted to stop the tests, just like I did, and I guess that's why I don't understand.  Just an hour ago you said she was getting better. It's killing her. Ms. Chambliss, I am a medical doctor.  And the decisions that I make are reasonable  No.  That is not true.  The injection that Dr. Calderon gave her is actually making her Do you think I don't want what's best for this child? Do you think that I'm not trying You can get a court order and you can try to enforce it, but I suggest that if you're I don't know yet, but I will.   You okay in there, Emily.  Good. I'm going to be right here the whole time, Hold on Sweetie. Settle down.  We'll get you out of there as fact as we can. She's gone into a coma. (Mulder looks around at where to turn, what to say. He looks I wouldn't. I wouldn't do it to her. Mulder, whoever brought this child into this world... didn't intend to love her. I have a chance to stop that. You were right. This child... was not meant to be. I think I'd like to be alone.  I think I'll ride back with Mulder. (Scully stands and hugs her mother. She hugs Bill. Who are the men who would create a life whose only hope was to die? She found me. How's Detective Kresge? And the men who did this to him? There is evidence of what they did.    Mulder?    I was just about to jump in the shower but I was waiting for the pizza man.    The pizza man?    No, what I mean was the pizza man's usually late, and so...    You want to come in?    I feel like I'm stuck in an episode of Mad About You.    Yeah, well, you know what I'm talking about.    Ah, I see.    Is that for me?    Nice package.    What's the occasion?    Well, I'm touched.    Hi... just, uh, give it to the man with the funny look on his face.    What are you doing, Agent Doggett?    I'm, uh... I feel all druggy.  Do you mind?    Thank you.    Who's we?    What's wrong, Agent Doggett?  You don't seem too good yourself.    Mm-hmm.    I realized it was me, that I was afraid.  Afraid to believe.    Why do you ask?    Agent Doggett, why do you ask?   Yeah.    That I had a partial abruption.  Which means that my placenta started to tear    Yeah.    Where have you been?    Agent Reyes.    I like her.    Well, then neither are you and I.  So this is a case you're working on?    Yeah, he's never talked to me about him, but I know something.  Are you    He's worth the effort, Mulder.    Mulder, you never fail to surprise me.  I just wish I felt like eating it right    Yes.  That's okay. He's coming by later.    No, I didn't, actually.  I thought about it a lot while I was lying in my    Oh, my god.  Oh, Mulder.    Not even close.    But then that's the other gift that you gave me, Mulder.    Courage... to believe.  And I hope that's a gift I can pass on.    Jason McPeck, Goochland, Virginia.    Yeah. His parents refused treatment on religious grounds.    Well, spontaneous remission, Mulder, isn't completely unheard of.    DARPA.    No.    As far as I can tell, I was the only one to whom it was delivered.    It's not a case, Mulder.       Hi, I'm Dana Scully with the, uh, Federal    I'm here about your son.    Ah, no. I was just hoping to better understand what happened to    And you say that you saw angels?    May I ask what they looked like?    And what did they say?    He pinched you?  Where?    What the hell are you doing?    Get out of my car!    You got your light.  Now get out.    So you want to give it to us.    You think I'm fooled by this?       Yes, I need a trace on a D.C. area phone number.    I'm sorry, I, uh, made a mistake.    Look, is this necessary?  I just walked through the wrong door.    Look...    You obviously knew that I would.       Please.       What are you dying of?    So, you want to use me to clear the slate... to make you a    I'm here.  Where is it ...  this miracle cure of yours?    I'll get back to you.       Mulder, it's me.  I wanted to let you know that       This is Dana Scully.  I'm not in right now.       You're going to smoke?    Just like that.    What exactly is it you expect to receive?    I might if you let me know where we're going.    I've always trusted Mulder.    Wow.  I'm learning a whole other side to you.  You're not just a    Where are we going?    And what's her relationship to you?    Nice to meet you.       Sir?       I'm on the road.  Um, I'm sorry to call you on this line.       Everything's okay.  I just wanted you to express       No, sir.  That's all right.  Can you tell him that    I'm going to the restroom.    Mulder, I'm trusting you'll be able to make sense of what's on    Unadulterated, thank you.    You drugged me.    How the hell did I get out of my clothes and into bed?    Where are we?    Well, that wasn't part of the deal.  I don't know what you're up to.    It's, uh... It's beautiful.    So, your contact's going to join us?    You extol our great trust but you still haven't told me who he is.    I'm still not clear what my importance is to this exchange.    What?    How?    Then you would be cured.    What do I do when I get there?    Well, wait.  Where did you get this?  Where did it come from,    Who developed it?    Yes, I'm Scully but I don't believe that we've spoken before or    They shot him.  They killed him and they shot at me.      You told me that no one else knew about this.       Oh, man.       Yes, I got it.    I've got to go.        No, it can't be.  It can't be.  It's got    He was here!  These were his offices.  What the hell is this?    Mulder, he laid it all out for me.

You can't    Mulder, I looked into his eyes.  I swear what he told me was true.       You think he used me to save himself-- at the expense of       You may be right... but for a moment, I saw something No, sorry. It's a wrong number. Where have you been, Mulder? I've been Why didn't you call when you got my message? Put your hands against the wall. I said put your hands against the wall! Do it! I don't know who you are. I said keep your hands up. I don't know what you're talking about. Mulder, it's me. I don't know, I'm... I'm in a telephone booth. A woman who's with you. He says you'll know what I'm talking He doesn't want to negotiate. He says he wants to make a trade. He wants you to be at Memorial Bridge at Bethesda in one hour. Mulder... Yeah. I'm okay. Mulder... I was discharged an hour ago and I asked to come here.

How could a man just sit Wait a minute. These X-Files indicate UFO related phenomena. Mulder, why would alien beings travel light years through space Can we talk to her now? Hi. I know you must be feeling really sad right now. And scared. Okay. Did you ever see any strangers with your daddy at home? Did you ever see... anyone yell at your daddy or your daddy Can you think of anyone who would want to hurt your daddy? Scully... Where? Mulder... There's been another one. The victim, Doug Reardon, was married with one daughter. Cause Ah... yes. On the jugular. Time of death was estimated at 2
30 It appears we have two serial killers working in tandem. Mulder, nothing beyond your leading questions to Teena Simmons Yes... The police report states that she remembers nothing. Tomorrow. She was kidnaped from the Social Services Home around 11 p.m. Connecticut State Troopers set up road blocks within a half an I told them to contact us if they happen to find her. Teena?

That girl's name is Do you still believe this is UFO related? Cindy Reardon didn't Well, there seems to be the random possibility that two people The girls are the one and only link between identical murders. Kidnaped. Where are you going? And you expect the pattern to continue. Okay. I'll call the San Francisco bureau and get someone to relieve you.

Dr. Kendrick was the supervising physician in both the Reardon's Well, she must have had an accomplice to have done both murders. Mulder, does this mean you've abandoned your UFO connection? Hello? Just a couple of clicks. Must be the wrong number. Mulder, you're rushing me out of the room. You got a girl coming over? Why the flashlights? Sally Kendrick... Are you Sally Kendrick? Did you work for the Luther Stapes Center for Reproductive Medicine My God. It's the girls. Until I heard that, I was beginning to suspect the girls. You suppose these girls have any idea of what they are? Mulder, let's go. There's someone upstairs, wait outside. Suspect's name is Sally Kendrick. Early 40's, 5'8, 135 pounds. And then what do we do? Okay, good. I want you to start a check on every single We just found the car at the airport. Someone else could have picked up the little girl without the That's it.

About his story. But in a substantiated crime. Is there still a medical staff? What kind of treatment? Was he receiving special treatment? Are you saying you don’t believe Nurse Charters’ This is Michelle Charters’? I’d like to review it myself, if that’s okay? Call 911. Hal. Can you speak?  I think And get me a defibrillator!

I don't understand, Mulder-- they came to take him from us-- why they      From the moment I became pregnant, I feared the truth... about how... and      Which is what? According to my briefing, the prisoners escaped by hiding in And they're both serving life terms. Murder convictions. It is. I don't know. Looks like some kind of de-con situation. That's right. We have orders to work with the federal marshals We don't know why we've been sent here. Maybe if we talked to Why? It came out of Skinner's office. No, why? I've got the same feeling, Mulder. I can try. Where are you going? Who are you? Are you the prison doctor? Who do you work for? You work for the Centers for Disease Control? What are you doing So am I. How many people are infected? Any deaths? What are the chances the men who escaped are infected? Mulder, it's me. I'm starting to get a picture of what's going There seems to be some kind of... Well, from what I've seen so far, thirty-six hours after infection, The exact nature of this thing... Not until I get some answers. I'm a federal agent, sir. To my partner, who needs to know if the men he's pursuing are Well, then I want to see charts and I want access to the infirmary. I need to know what these men are dying from. You said this Do all of the victims have these boils? Yes, I'm trying to trace the origin of a package that was sent What do you know about Pinck Pharmaceuticals? They sent a package to a prisoner here who may have been the No, it's empty. That sounds like what I'm finding on all the victims in here. I'm on it. Why? What's going on? What the hell is going on? By who, the C.D.C.? Pinck Pharmaceuticals. You work for Pinck Pharmaceuticals? Disappeared how? Like this? Is this what caused the outbreak? So the contagion only spreads when the pustules erupt and the Mulder, they're enforcing a full quarantine. One of the epidimiologists who claimed to be with the C.D.C. Why else would the national guard be here? The public? Mulder, we can't leak this, not until we know more. If this gets out... What if someone dies because we didn't? Yeah. I'm okay. All I want you to worry about is capturing that And if I am? How long will this take? What? What do you want me to do? Why did you confide in me? How can I prove it? What are you doing? You don't work for the C.D.C. Well, we'll leave that up to others to decide. Mulder... I think everything here is under control. Yeah. He's alive? Mulder, listen to me. Everything here has been destroyed. If you want the truth, Mulder, he's going to have to make a We can't prove a thing, Mulder. They've made sure of it. The Costa Rican government just faxed me the report on the missing Come on, let's go. This isn't funny, Mulder. Who? Is that what this is about? Try explaining that to Section Cheif McGrath. He stepped I don't understand you Mulder. Why you're always defying Because it wasn't. What you saw was not a toxic spill. It was a downed Libyan jet with a nuclear warhead. (Mulder  That story happens to be highly classified. If they're searching for anyone, its probably the pilot. Well, maybe he ejected. You can't be serious! Mulder, the hearing is tomorrow morning at ten o'clock. My assignment is to bring you back, not to help you What's going on? Who would... Get your hands up! A-mazing. Yeah. Wolf Industries supplied the CIA with all of its I'm sorry about your husband. Mrs. Wright, we want to help you. The government can't do that. I'm sure if you appealed You're entitled to the truth. Does that mean Jason Wright was your patient? Did you note any cadaver acute heat rigor or heat stiffening? Lets say those men died from radiation exposure. Couldn't Yeah, so have I. In Hiroshima at Ground Zero. Mulder I don't claim to know all the answers, but if Of course, I... I'll scrub up. It was terrible. We lost all but two. And they're still I don't know. And under other circumstances, I would What?  Are you saying Max Fenig is an abductee? Mulder, the Not all of them. DILANTIN is an anti-convulsant, but Okay. You pack. I'll take a look at Max...on the way Come on, Mulder. Lets get this over with. Mulder - look at this.  Mulder! Where do you think you are going? Look, if we go to Yeah, so what? They're dead.  What are you doing? You have a very sick man He's a delusional schitzophrenic. What?! No, sir No, sir. Yes. Sir. Request permision to make a statement. Sir, its unfair to judge Mulder by the same criteria... But sir, I... Good luck So you saw nothing when the window broke? No one outside? Okay. Thank you. They claim they didn't see anything. What the janitors describe sounds more like a sonic boom. Mulder, if you're still suggesting that the elephant did this, An invisible elephant? Have they determined what he died of? Ambrose? What're you looking for, Mulder? Excuse me. We're looking for Willa Ambrose. Thank you. Miss Ambrose? I'm Agent Dana Scully.  This is Agent Well, a federal employee was fatally injured last night, and No, I was just wondering why such a small pen for such a large Would he be vindictive enough to let Ganesha go as an act of W.A.O? And you consider that inhumane treatment? According to FBI files, you've been arrested over a dozen times Hmmm. Were you involved in the liberation of Ganesha? Preoccupied with what? Will they win? I thought you said she rescued this gorilla. Even if that means trampling a man to death? Well, we found our suspects. Well, you heard the man - "all animals should run free." Well, the lights they were using at the construction site were These guys are dedicated to exactly this kind of activity, It wouldn't surprise me if they tried to capitalize on their By liberating another animal. Willa Ambrose said that the zoo And where are you going? Mulder, it's me. I was right. I just followed the kid from There's a member of the W.A.O. on the premises. What's going on? You have no idea what he was doing at the zoo? What if I said I saw this camera sitting up there on the shelf A tiger is missing, and a member of your organization is dead. Well, if I find evidence that he was releasing those animals You know, that guy really pisses me off. Yeah. Have they found the tiger yet? What? You saw his body, Mulder. That kid was mauled to death. She speaks to you? Is this who you wanted to speak to, Mulder? Why would she be afraid of the light? I hope you know what you're getting us into, Mulder. This isn't exactly in my job description. Okay. You're right, Mulder. The signs in the uterus and ovaries are This animal had been pregnant. There's evidence of hyperplasia and the corpus luteum is How'd the tiger get all the way across town without being I just finished up in the infirmary. A sheriff's deputy came You want to see something interesting? I was looking for a pen to finish my report in Willa's office, Do you have any idea what he would have been doing at the zoo? We have a witness who says that you visited Kyle's office For what purpose? Did you ask him to help you take Sophie to prevent her from But he helped you to rescue her originally, isn't that correct? But you asked him anyway ... to help you. Then what was he doing here last night, and why did he give Did he make a habit of visiting the zoo? You think she's telling the truth? Well, Kyle Lang's death and the disappearance of the animal And you've been pushing this alien abduction angle. You mean to losing Sophie? You think she killed him? Even wait atop a stack of crates for a former lover to walk Looks like you're in a hurry. I'm afraid there is. I found evidence that Kyle died a wrongful Ed Meecham took Sophie? Where is she, Willa? Mulder? Mulder? Sorry. Lie still. Lie down.  Can we get a paramedic in here? Ed Meecham's been arrested. We picked him up on the way Who did? She's outside. She's going in to make a statement about  What happened here?    Which rules out decomposition.   I'd say predation, but the... the       Right. Well, I'd say it looks like a double    Well, what do you think this is?    And what does that have to do with these two?    UFOs.  Extraterrestrial visitors from beyond who apparently have    Mulder, can't you just for once, just... for the novelty of it    The connective tissue is more or less intact.    If you'll, um, pardon an obvious question are you sure that these    Would you, uh, happen to know what this is?      No.  You go ahead.    Water, hydrochloric acid... Electrolytes, pepsins and    Chitinase?    Both of these were discovered as skeletal remains.    It says here that the bodies were found not far from where Angela    Oh, Mulder, answer your phone.    Do me a favor.  I want you to forward a sample of that secretion    And, uh, in the meantime, could I borrow your truck?    Mulder?!    Mulder?!  Mulder!    Mulder.  Why the hell did you leave North Carolina without telling    You disappear and then I get a furtive call that you're back here    No.    Angela... and Wallace Schiff.  But, Mulder, it can't be.    Mulder, I I.D.'d their remains myself.    The aliens?    Mulder...    What?    Mulder, from what very little I understand about this case, this    Who?    I... I can hear him.       Oh, my god.    I, uh... I don't know what to say, Mulder.  Where to begin.  I    You were right about the grays, about... about the abductions,    They were... they were fake.  They were decoys.    It was nothing.  It was bog sludge.    Mulder, I'm admitting that I was wrong.    Are... are you all right?    How are you feeling?    What?    Mulder, if I, of all people, can believe this then why can't you?    Yeah. I looked.  It's empty.  It's as if he just vanished.    Doctor... It's more of that digestive material.  (uses a latex    They were only going in before.    How? I mean, this, this cave's not much more than a hole in the       That, um... that digestive secretion      Well, it's... it's chemically    It was... it was on the Schiffs.    What is the most logical explanation?       What arrangement?    Sir?  You're satisfied with my conclusions in this case?    Well... I was unable to determine a clear cause of death nor was I       No.  I mean that was one possible scenario that I    My role in the X-Files has always been to provide a... a rational    Have I?  How many X-Files has my scientific approach fully and    Sir, this one makes no sense at all.    That's what Agent Mulder would have thought.    I, uh... I still can't believe it.    No, thank you.    I was beginning to think that I was the only one who was a little       Find who?    I don't understand.       Those were not my findings.  You guys believe    No, it is not the obvious answer!       What the hell is wrong with everybody?!  You guys,    You three, of all people!  You should be all over this, not buying       What have you done with him?    Where is Mulder?  Where is he?  What have you done with him?!       Look, something else    Mulder, the Schiffs are dead.    Mulder, their remains were discovered in a field.  That's...    How did you get here?    From North Carolina direct to your apartment door?  (MULDER thinks    Mulder, why did you knock?  This is your apartment.  (MULDER    Mulder, this is not reality.  This is a hallucination.  It has to    Something that we found in that field, Mulder, because that's    This is it, Mulder.  What if we're still there?  If we're still in    No, Mulder, bear with me.  I think this is making sense.  I think    A giant fungal organism, Mulder.  We already know that they exist.    To make it complacent.  To keep it still while it devours it.    What if we're still underground, Mulder?  What if we're moving    That's correct, sir.  We know that the organism extends for at    The lab results determined that the spores we were exposed to have    That's right.    Well, the fact remains we did.    Mulder, we did escape.  I think you're suffering from    Mulder, I...    Mulder!       Mushroom.    But it's not?    ... but you're not.    Seven years?    Not even I would be so farfetched.    What I'm thinking, Mulder, is how familiar this seems.  Playing    Okay, so these agents were investigating something.    Something... much like what they themselves were almost killed    Two third parties.  Twins?  Relatives?  A doppelganger?       A corporeal likeness    ... which in psychological terms represents the person's secret    Mulder, the slide, please.       Yes!    Maybe you should take another look at that photograph,    Are you still pleading ignorance, Mr. Zupanic?  Is that not you    And who's that sitting next to you?    Try Betty Templeton.  We can't find her, Mr. Zupanic.    Mm-hmm.    Alderwood, blue house.    Mr. Zupanic, do you have any reason to be lying to us?    Thank you, Mr. Zupanic.  I've no doubt we'll be in touch with you.    That Mr. Zupanic not only knows Betty Templeton and where    Well, I guess that's why they put the "I" in the FBI.    So I take it from your posture, Mulder, you've solved this case.    Narrowed it down to where?    Bert Zupanic is a boxer?    So what? We wait around Kansas City for a couple of days until    Well, finding Betty Templeton won't solve this case, Mulder.    Our doppelganger who lived, until yesterday in a pink house on    It's not just car accidents and fistfights, Mulder.  It's house    Mr. Zupanic?    Uh, there was an incident.  You were struck by flying glass.    Would that be Betty or Lulu, Mr. Zupanic?    'Cause they're the ones who caused this and they'll do it again       Scully.       Betty Templeton?       Well, Lulu Pfeiffer works at Koko's, too.  And that's       What's going on here?       Well, I think that this is more than just physical       She just took off, Mulder.  She left work and she       That's exactly what she's driving.    Uh, yes.  I'm looking for someone.  He was here speaking to    Yeah.    And you don't know where he went?    How about Internet access?    Is he in there?    Can you wake him up for me?    It's important.    Mr. Danfous?       Mr. Danfous, I'm Special    It's an FBI title, sir.    Mr. Danfous, if you'll let me explain why I'm here we might be    Mr. Danfous, through a lot of matching-up of documents that I    I believe that you may be the father of two daughters.    Using documents filed by a sperm bank in Sparta, Illinois and    Well, be that as it may, sir, it is very likely that you are the       Mulder?       Where have you been?       What happened to you?       I don't know, but I have been able to locate the       Yeah.  He's here in the state pen.       Well, the biggest thing that I can figure out right       They're both after him?       Well, if they're the reason it doesn't explain what's    Mr. Zupanic?    50 million anonymous donations have been made to sperm    Bert Zupanic and his non-fraternal biological sibling both    Betty Templeton and Lulu Pfeiffer products of different mothers    ... an angry drifter now doing time for counterfeiting-- chanced    I've been thinking hard about that, Mr. Saperstein.  I would like    If four should meet, the result is...  well, suffice to say it's I forgot what it was like to spend a day in court. It's open. It's unlocked. Must be an X-File. What do you think it is? Hello. Three-pipe problem? How private? Mulder, you just keep unfolding like a flower. Yeah, I noticed how you couldn't drop everything fast enough Oh, is that what you were extending? Something tells me you're not going to get rid of her that easily. So, Sherlock, is the game afoot? What do you mean? Put me through what? What are you talking about? Wait, and Phoebe knows about this? So she shows up knowing the power she has over you and then Mulder? Are you sure you don't want me to help you out on this After reviewing the files of the Scotland Yard arson murders, The arsonist is most likely a male, less than twenty-five years Agent Beatty? I'm Special Agent Dana Scully. Can I... steal a minute of your I'm... working with Agent Mulder. You mentioned that the arsonist might be using some kind of What if he got some of this fuel into some... hand cream or, The arsonist is usually unmarried and prone to excessive fantasies His crimes are often very clever and elaborately planned. The Thank you. It's Scully, where are you? There's something I need to show you. I might have some information... Can I meet you somewhere? There's a fire upstairs. On the fourteenth floor. We've got a fire on the fourteenth floor! You were really out. She's down the hall. Okay, the doctor checked them out. It could've happened to anyone. What do you know about this guy that saved the kids? The driver? Who was watching the kids tonight? Are you sure? I could have sworn I saw him down in the hallway You all right? You at all interested in what I came up here to show you? Well, I did a little checking of my own. I didn't know a whole And these people probably don't even tie their own shoes. There Nothing. Apparently, he was question by Scotland Yard and they released You're going to love this. On a list of recent visas issued What are you going to do? Yes, this is Special Agent Scully. I've been waiting on hold It's the driver. What's the matter? Yes. Michael? Quick, come on... Freeze! Federal agent. Stay right where you are.  Care to take me to lunch? Where is Phoebe? You don't know? She didn't call? Did you play it? Why not? Aren't you curious what's on it? X-File number 11214893. Addendum to the file opened by Special ...confined to a hyperbaric chamber until he can be tried on I'd always heard that he was brilliant. But that was alive. Over what? How soon can we get up there? Mulder, I appreciate your concern - but I'm ready. I've already lost too much time. Shouldn't we find the rest of the descent team first? Mulder! What's going on? Can you think of anything that might have caused or contributed You're part of the team, Jesse? What do you mean? Well, considering what they've been through, not especially. Well, they've been living in the middle of nowhere for almost a Based on what? Now, Mulder, you're sounding paranoid. OK. That should do it. Do you have a freezer?  Why don't you radio for the helicopter, Why not? I know. He killed Pierce and probably Erikson. What are you talking about? Mulder, nothing can live in a volcanic interior, not only  It describes the metabolism from But the fundamental building block for every organism known Mulder, that is science fiction. It's, it's an elaborate construct Mulder, whatever evidence Trepkos had, he destroyed. Why on earth would they do that? But, Mulder, the fact is Jesse? Can I talk to you? Are you OK? What happened here, Jesse? You can trust me. Do you think the descent somehow triggered his breakdown? Lithium carbonate. What are you so afraid of, Jesse? Where is home? I can't tell whether it's an infection or a toxic reaction, Give me the short wave.  This is Agent Scully with the Firewalker team.  You guys go ahead.  Request dispatch of Med-Evac to our location Tanaka's collapsed. We're getting him out. Without better imaging equipment, I can't say for sure. It appears to be some kind of a fungus. Well, I'm not a botanist, but I think it's fair to guess that it's Spores. I scraped them off the tip of the fungus. It appears Maybe now there is, but we won't have conclusive proof until This might explain something else, though. The spore could We don't know that. If it was an airborne microbe, any of us Not until we know how it's transmitted, how it incubates.  Maybe you should go check up on O'Neil. What if he's already dead? He's dangerous, Mulder. He's already killed two men. Will you at least let me go with you? Look, I know what you're thinking but you have to get past that.  I have attempted to culture the spore using Jesse? I thought you might like to know, chances are good that none OK, Jesse? Jesse? Jesse? Oh! God, you scared me! Jesse? Are you OK? Jesse, what are you doing? I'm OK, I'm OK. I'm OK. Yeah. Look. She was infected. I don't know how. Did you find him? Mulder, what are you doing?       "To protect all proprietary or    F.P.S.       Video games.    I can get in the Pentagon easier than this.    How about a simple explanation as to why we're here?    Okay.    What kind of accident?    How did the victim die?    Was there equipment involved?    What's your business here?    Yeah.    Only there's a dead body between you and untold riches.    This man's been shot.    What do you call this?    You say this weapon is a toy but this man clearly has gunshot       Well, the next call's going to be to the    Well, connections or not, you've got a murder victim here.       Yes, this is Special Agent Dana Scully with the    My partner, Agent Mulder.  This is Detective LaCoeur.    Mulder, you're not serious.    Mulder, that's any voluptuous vixen out of any number of video    Yeah, but even if they had, she's not real.  She's a character.    Who's Daryl Musashi?    What's he doing here?    Mulder, why does this game have the effect of reducing grown    Mulder.    Do you want me to autopsy the body?       Preliminary external examination of deceased,       Scratch that.  Cause    I thought I was on to something.  You know, Mulder, this suit    Yeah, well, if only that were the case.    I thought at first that maybe the uh, suit had malfunctioned, that    Yeah, wasted on a stupid game.    Dressing up like high-tech warriors to play a futuristic version    Mulder, what - what purpose does this game serve except to add    You think that taking up weapons and creating gratuitous virtual    Well, that must be why men feel the great need to blast the crap    Yeah, I've seen it. A computer-animated woman, Mulder, with a computer-animated    Pictures don't kill people, Mulder, guns kill people.    You get the feeling these men have something better to do?    Was she read her rights?    For the record, can you state your name, please?       I'm sorry.  Your real name?    No.    Well, you're not upsetting me, Miss, uh...    You say that you have no knowledge of Ivan Martinez or a company    Would it surprise you to know that you have been placed at a    You might want to start telling the truth.    What?    They paid you to scan your body?    Hello.    Phoebe?   Hey, you okay?    Where is everybody?  Where's Ivan?    Well, we need to talk to him right away about a woman named    What for?    Hey...    Somebody's shooting at them.    Mulder?       He's getting his ya-yas out.    Where's Mulder?    I said, where's Mulder?  Maybe you guys didn't hear me.    I saw what he did.  But where did he go?    I saw where he went.  I want to know where he is.  Is there a    Yeah.  Easy for you to say.    What do you mean?    Where?    Yes, but where's the game?    What?    Yeah, and you're going to be counting teeth.    The game has disappeared.    Jade Blue Afterglow--  does that ring a bell?    Oh, you'd remember her.    Hey.  Phoebe.    You knew about her?  Then it was you.  You scanned that    But why?    I wouldn't be so sure.    But, Phoebe, she is still a killer.  I can't explain it, but she is.    You've got to destroy her, Phoebe.    Well, there's got to be some way.  There's got to be some    Her name is Maitreya.    She's input herself into the game.  We have to download her.    Frohike, what's wrong?  What is that?    What?    Hey.  No fair picking on a girl.    There's no picture.    That's not the game.    Where's Mulder?    Shut the game down.    Well, just turn it off!    Look!  We have to get him out of there!    You okay?    Mulder!    Mulder? Sir? A threat assessment for whom? What do you mean? You’re saying "I" a lot. I heard "we." Mulder …  Scully.  What?  On the case that’s a total  Which one? There’s  "Hiding in the  "Hiding in the light."  Well, Mr. Resnick was a deacon  Not as such. He showed  I told you so. Who’s the agent in charge? I’m Scully. Agent Mulder’s partner. Who’s inside? No. Not until we get a clear idea of the situation. If you make a phone call right now, it could compromise No. If it was safe to do so he would have  Who? Give it to him. Is he getting this?  You look exhausted. Agent Rice has the situation in hand. Let’s Uh, no, Mr. Pincus. Thank you very much for  What’s going on? Mulder, why didn’t you take the day off? Have you slept? What exactly is it you think you have here? Mulder, you’re not serious. No. Well, what you’re describing would be more like Mulder, he was disturbed. He was mentally ill. This monster was a sick  No. No, I mean, this … How? No. No, absolutely not. Mulder, I am not going to serve the delusions of Mulder … Sir? You wanted to see me? Sir? Agent Mulder believes that there may be a connection To the best of my knowledge, Agent Mulder is currently I’ll get right on it, sir.   No, sir. Let’s start with the photos. In fact, let’s Knock yourself out.  Come on, Mulder.  No. This man died Absolutely. More or less what we thought we’d find. The body showed signs of decomposition beyond what No, Mulder… Mulder, the case is over. There’s no more I wish it were that simple. No. Let’s flip him. Yep. Give me a hand.  I’ve come a long way, I believe that Agent Mulder is mentally sound and  I can personally vouch for the fact  It was dark. The truth … as well as I under stand it. Folie A Deux. A madness shared by two. William... Well, it seems that Dr. Sanjay had a psychotic break and committed suicide. Note the letter opener sticking out of his head. All the witnesses I spoke to have consistent accounts. Is that why we're here? You're interested in the server? What are you looking for, Mulder? The reason why we're investigating, rather than the local police is because we have security clearance.  Can you confirm that you have security cameras watching over the entire complex? There's that one, and I saw a few more out there. In that case, I'd like to see all of the tapes. As soon as possible. Sorry, we're not finished...  Mulder, that's not your phone. Riley vs. California. The Supreme Court ruled that you needed a warrant to search a mobile phone. Well, there is no victim. He killed himself. Dr. Sanjay is from western India. Gupta's a Marathi word. It means "secret." I'm old-school, Mulder. Pre-Google. Deceased is a male, 35 years old.  Five foot eight and three-quarters inches. 180 pounds. The probable cause of death is the introduction - self-propelled - of a letter opener, into the cerebral cortex by way of the ear canal. I will now commence with my overall external examination. Mulder, you gotta see this. I had to break his fingers to pry them open. But he wrote that on the palm of his hand before he died. The Founder is what they called Dr. Goldman at Nugenics. Is that why you wanted to talk to him? Well, there were no abnormalities in Dr. Sanjay's brain. The opener destroyed the acoustic nerve and then went into the cerebral cortex. Yeah. It ended up in the auditory cortex. You know... he blurted something out at the meeting, before his suicide. He said
 "Can't anyone hear that?" But nobody else could hear a thing. Hmm. But where? We've checked out every square inch of his apartment. It's hard to imagine, in 2016, that Sanjay had to keep his lifestyle preferences a secret.  Mulder? I found something. Yeah. It's a clinical setting. It looks like it might be a hospital.  The police are coming up. We must have triggered a silent alarm. Mulder? Mulder, are you okay? They're coming. Mulder. FBI. Find her. Find her.  Find her... Find her... Find her... If you look at the files that we found in Dr. Sanjay's apartment...  They're right over there. I think there were many troubling details to this case, and, um... if Agent Mulder has nothing more to add... ...then I think we need time to prove his theory. Yeah, from Nugenics. I've been working on syncing all the cameras to the exact time code of Dr. Sanjay's suicide.  There. What happened to you at Sanjay's apartment, Mulder? . I can understand why you wouldn't want to tell Skinner, but I was there, I saw you on your knees in pain. There were no sounds. I didn't hear anything. Maybe they seeded the lawn that morning. Mulder, how are these connected? The birds, the suicide, the kids, the genetic anomalies. What are you hiding? Sanjay heard sounds - right before he committed suicide. That could be you, Mulder. This is dangerous. I might know how to get to Goldman. Dr. Goldman is a blessing.  That's why we're here today. I've become aware of a situation that I wanted to share with you. Dr. Goldman is under investigation. We wanted to spare him the indignity of having the government knock at his door unannounced. I was wondering if we could meet with him in private. Sister Mary, I've worked here for seven years. You know me. I wouldn't ask if it weren't important. Thank you. Do you want to call someone? Agnes. Wait. I'm a doctor. You can tell me anything. The hospital is only concerned with the health of the mother and the baby. Of course, your baby. Thank you. Mulder... I'm not a fragile little girl. This is what you suspected all along, but were afraid to articulate. Is this what you believe happened to me 15 years ago? When I got pregnant, when I had my baby?  Was I just an incubator? Do you ever think about William? He'd be 15 years old now. And I've missed every single year of his life. And sometimes... I hate myself that I didn't have the courage to stand by him. Do you believe he was an experiment? What if he's out there somewhere, like one of those kids on Sanjay's wall? Fighting for his life? It's the first day of school. Are you nervous? Your hands are sweaty. What's the most important thing to remember? The most important thing to remember... is that I love you. That's all you have to remember.  Come on, let's go say "Hi" to your teacher. Thank you. Be home in time for dinner! Will... You're gonna be fine. You've just broken your arm. Does it hurt anywhere else?  Okay, we're gonna get you to the hospital, and take some X-rays to make sure you don't have a concussion, okay, honey? I've read everything you published, Dr. Goldman. It seems your research deals primarily with genetic manipulation? Sure. Hi, Adam. My name is Dr. Scully. How long have you been here, Adam? And where are your parents? And why is he in a sealed room? All of the children. He has a genetic disorder. He's not contagious. Alien DNA? Is that why the Department of Defense is funding your research?  He didn't answer my question... Did you see that Mulder? What about the baby?  She was pregnant... Mulder... Agnes died from blunt force trauma. Most likely from the impact of the car. Her right ulna was broken in two places, her lungs were lacerated by broken ribs, and her skull was crushed. Surgically removed. I couldn't tell if the fetus was still alive when it was taken from her womb, but... they took it, Mulder. To get rid of evidence. Agnes wanted to talk. She left the hospital. That baby was the only proof that she was part of Goldman's experiment. Mulder, that car hit her so hard that a, an adult woman with the benefit of a mature skeletal structure wasn't able to survive the impact. It's highly unlikely that the baby would remain viable. But what you're talking about is changing the genetic makeup of a population. That's the next step in evolution. There was a study published last year in Nature Communications, by Batini and Hallast, that found that Y chromosomes in the majority of European men could be traced back to just three individuals from the Bronze Age. Dr. Goldman's wife? Mulder, she hasn't said anything in ten minutes. Can we ask you a few questions, Jackie? Do you know what happened to your son? A mother never forgets. All my training, everything that I know about psychology tells me that she's delusional. But Mulder, there's something about her that I trust. Are you saying that you think the baby that communicated with her communicated with you? Action, reaction. I'm Special Agent Scully. This is Special Agent Mulder. We'd like to speak with Kyle Gilligan. Well, we'd still like to speak with him. Why don't you let us decide that? Mulder... Mulder, she's making it pretty clear... Mulder! Mulder!  Where is he? Where is he?! Whatever you're doing, stop right there. Molly?  I know who knows. Kyle?! Kyle! Have they found Molly or Kyle? Kyle's blood.  Drug and alcohol tests came back negative. Both at the same base? Wasn't there a riot there about a month ago? Why did the military contact us? She doesn’t believe it was suicide. It looks like some kind of ritual symbol. Mrs. McAlpin believes voodoo was behind her husband's Did he ever discuss with you what went on there? Was he ever treated for depression or stress?  Come on, Mulder.  Let’s go, Mulder. Two of your men have died in the past two weeks allegedly But your soldiers aren't in combat. How so? So your men are getting the brunt of the refugees' I'd also like to examine Private McAlpin's body. So they pronounced him at the scene? Mulder, I need to speak with you. How did you know? Somebody stole McAlpin's body and replaced it with what Somehow, Bauvais must have switched the bodies. Well, then he had somebody else do it. I was only suggesting that whoever did it was clever and Mulder, voodoo only works by instilling fear in its believers. Private McAlpin? He’s nonverbal, nonresponsive to voice, touch or pain. Well, obviously, he never left. Dr. Foyle made a gross Yeah.  Electrolytes, white and red counts are all You have a theory how it got into his blood? Well, I hope you don't intend to tell Robin McAlpin that But, Mulder, it’s a lethal poison. Well, zombie or not, Jack McAlpin is alive. Why did they bury Private Guttierez here? Too late? Don't the police intervene? Mulder ..  Maybe I should kiss a few and find How do you get out of the camp? What about your parents? Are your parents at the camp? Mulder, certain frog species secrete a substance called  What’s going on? Colonel Wharton sanctioned beatings of the refugees? Why hasn't anybody stepped forward or filed a complaint? Well, we don't know what happened to him but there is a Sounds like an old wives’ tale. Think he’s telling the truth? He’s superstitious, and superstition breeds fear. We suspect it was an act of retaliation. For your mistreatment of the detainees. Physical abuse of political refugees is a prosecutable Then there is no official policy of harassment? Sorry, Mulder, there’s a big difference between nasty looks Ah!!! More scare tactics.  No. It’s nothing.  You don't understand. I've been on hold for  Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.  Mulder, I just got through to Dunham’s Mulder, listen to this. Dunham's been AWOL since last Mulder? Oh, God.  Yeah. Yeah. It's Dunham. Why did you sign the confession?  I'm fine. It's just a headache. He said it himself. He signed a confession.  That’s Bauvais. And Wharton? Mulder … Dunham and Guttierez both filed complaints It wasn’t Bauvais. Those men were about to testify against Colonel Wharton. I’m all right. No, I’m fine. I’ll catch up with you. Just go get Wharton.  Mulder … I feel better than you look. What happened? He’s dead. Did you kill him? Thank you. Is this a complete list? There was a boy. His name was Bonaparte. How's that? Couldn't she just have changed clothes? Well, we're 30 floors up, no other means of egress. Hard to imagine in this day and age someone having sex You know, I don't even know why we got this call in the All young, healthy adults. You think there's a new drug on the streets? The chemicals animals secrete? You mean, sexual attractants? So you think somebody is synthesizing them? Well, there's still a question as to whether humans can He or she? You've got victims of both sexes. So what is our profile of the killer? Indeterminate height, The killer's moving south. Right. They live up there without electricity, phones, What's so weird about that? Well, wait a minute. Aren't these people famous for their We're investigating a possible murder. Did the Kindred let you take those pictures?  Hi. She must have problems on the asphalt. Has she ever That's sweet. Did you name her? That's all right.  I'm Dana Scully. I was just talking ... Yeah, I think so. There's something up there, Mulder. After you. What does the map say? Mulder, look. We're FBI agents. Federal police. I'm going to have to ask you to remain at a distance, We just want to have a few questions answered. We have pictures. A crime has been committed. We have certain questions Hotel security videos of a man and a woman who may have In a hotel in Washington, DC. And may kill again, which is why we need your help. He can't breathe. He's choking to death! Take me back to the 20th century. Believe all what? Well, they better take care of their own or that man at the What? The choking? Do you think they know who the murderer is? I know, that was odd. These people have probably been intermarrying for years. What are you doing? Uh-huh. What do you think? The murders? What's his name? What do you mean, different? We're not sure. All of the victims died of cardiac arrest. Maybe, how do you know that? Why did you keep them? You said Marty was different. How? How did he kill his victims? Does it have something to do with the ceremony in the What are you doing? Oh ... oh.  I don't know. No. Thanks. Better ... a little embarrassed, actually. It's like I don't remember ... Because he told me he knew who the killer was. I believed him. So what did you see down in the cellar? How do you know he was alive? Changing sexes? So you're saying these people ... Think he was trying to kill me? Well, if he was trying to kill me, why did they let us go? Did she touch you or make physical contact in any other What did you see, Michael? She was a man. Well, I can't rule out the possiblity that who we're looking I just don't want us to ignore the obvious. I mean, how This is Agent Scully requesting police backup and additional Mulder! Dead body!  I'm OK. Federal agent, I'm armed!  Back away! Step away! Step away! No. Step away.  They're gone. I don't understand. How can they just disappear? Excuse me.  Yeah.  Yes sir. Four years ago, Section Chief Blevins assigned me to Yes Sir. Recent events have shed new light on the factual and Agent Mulder was recently contacted by man who's pursuit of So he toppled over me and down the stairs. Speaking of Bill, is he coming? (The maid opens the door and Look at you, my big brother.  Yes, I did. Thanks for remembering this year. I'm fine. Let's get some dinner, huh? No, I'm sorry. Father McCue, I... Father McCue.. I appreciate my mother's concern, and yours. I haven't felt the need. I have strength and I...(the phone Excuse me. (She gets up and takes the phone from Bill in the No, is something the matter? Contacted you about what? What?  When? I'm on my way. It's okay. Who's this... Arlinsky? What am I coming to see? Who found him? You have the ice core samples here? I have no opinion, actually. This is your holy grail, Mulder. Not mine. It just means proving to the world the existence of alien life You already believe, Mulder. What difference would it make? Only if it were disproven. I don't think about it, actually, and I don't think it can be I can't go with you, Mulder. What I couldn't tell Agent Mulder, what I had only learned myself, But not in old ice. So it hasn't been tampered with? Another agent asked me to. From a site in the Yukon Territory, why? Plant or animal? From what? Is it capable of cell division? Yes. Please. Excuse me, I'm looking for Dr. Vitagliano.  Dr. I'm supposed to meet him here. Actually, I a little late. Bill. What are you doing here? Thank you. Um. Where's Mom? I was ... ahhh ... knocked down a flight of stairs, but I'm I told Mom not to tell you. Because it's very personal... Because I don't want sympathy. Oh, now come on, Bill... What should I be doing?! Hey, look, just because I haven't bared my soul to you, or to Thank you for coming.  Have you run it through the NCIC? Try the federal data base.  Where does he work?  STOP! FEDERAL AGENT! HOLD IT! (She runs after him. She runs Put your hands on the car. (She slams him onto the side of the I don't know what you're talking about. I had reached agent Mulder at a warehouse just outside of Washington He told me a story which detailed, point by point, the systematic I was only able to convince him to meet me so that he might Mulder...  What? So is this man. (She motions to the hot water bath. Mulder walks Who did this, Mulder? Mulder?  You said it yourself, Mulder. More tests needed to be run. Cellular material found in the ice core samples were a direct Mulder, everything this man described. You can't just guess Mulder, the only lie here is the one that you continue to believe. Because it's easier to believe the lie. Isn't it? He said that the men behind this hoax... behind these lies... Earlier this morning, I got a call from the police, asking me Agent Mulder died late last night from an apparent self-inflicted No, really ... And it wasn't accidental? Who's running the investigation? The forensics instructor at the Academy?  How come you two went your separate ways? Seriously. And you? I know where you ended up. What about Jerry? What kind of bad luck?  Twenty-nine? Must be for the visually impaired. Yeah. What was that? Hello? This is Agent Dana Scully. Uh, actually, I think everything's okay. ...he completed the circuit. And to throw a 180 pound man ten feet. (Looks at cracked  It's past three. Maybe if you cleaned your desk more than once a year. Come on. We're late.  Is that your profile? What did he say? I just got off the phone with Peterson, the systems engineer. He said it would be a short list. And it's headline news And fully consistent with Jerry's excellent behavioral profile.  Brad Wilczek?  I take it Benjamin Drake fit into the first category. And you had a different vision for the company? Could you have done it? You don't seem too worried.  Mulder, take a look. And this we spliced together from a series of lectures Brad Now we'll stack them.  Which means that he was the one that killed Drake. He I heard about Jerry. I'm sorry. What? To destroy evidence. To cover his tracks. Mulder, you've been through a lot - - more than I think even  He just signed a confession. Mulder, don't you see, blaming the machine is an alibi, and So the machine killed Drake out of self-defense? Mulder, that level of artificial intelligence is decades away  Mulder, I think you're looking for something Where are you going? Hello? Oh my God.  This is Mulder! Someone or something's been scanning my computer files. How can we get in? Mulder! Oh, great. Mulder? What are you doing? Unh.... Ahhhhh!!!!!  Put down the gun. Shut up and drop the gun.  Mulder, put in the disc. He was arrested last week for the murders of at least seven Was there a signature or a defining MO? Both eyes punctured... signature gashes from the corners The level of violence and overkill here would suggest the Well, possession is a common claim by criminals who have A copy cat? You have a nice soft bunk, sir. Why aren't you using it? Or maybe it's just the name of your accomplice. You killed all those young men yourself? Well, its fingerprints weren't on the murder weapon, yours Is that was it did last night, John? Snapped its fingers and Yes, I know. Behavioral Science... You wrote the book. No, not at all, sir. You're not going to tell me when your love affair with I thought you were considered his fair-haired boy when Why not? You mean you couldn't worship him. Well, from what I hear, there are a lot of men who did. By the looks of this, I'd say that served him pretty well. I thought it was one of those pictures coming to life. One of our guys must have locked it in here. It's a door. Why don't you wait until we can get some more light in here?  See anything?  Why would he keep them in a secret room?  Mulder...  Mulder, what is it?  What do you see?  Mulder! Can you tell me what's going on in there? We've turned the studio upside down and there doesn't Five. All of them dismembered, all of them young men What does Patterson have to say? Well, I'd have to agree with that theory. He thinks our finding Mostow's secret gallery isn't going He requested him? Mulder's under the impression that Patterson never thought Stitches? What happened? He was going to see what he could find out about these I think the same thing you are, sir. A second killer. Mulder? Mulder, its me. Mulder? I was scared, Mulder. I didn't know where you were. You turned your phone off?  Thanks. You still haven't told what you were doing in Mostow's studio. AT 3
30 in the morning? Mulder, I haven't seen or spoken to It? What are you talking about? Mostow killed those men, Mulder, and out of some sick Well, did you actually see it? Mulder, maybe you're Listen to yourself, Mulder. Listen to what you're saying. Look, when I couldn't reach you, I went to your apartment. I saw your new wallpaper. Don't you realize what is He requested your involvement through Skinner's office.  Mulder... where are you going? Sir, can I have a minute? In private? Maybe you can tell me... I'm curious about what you're I think you do, sir. I think you knew exactly how Agent You know I already have. I just want you to be honest with me about what you're trying Then why? And you knew that he could help you solve it. I'm sorry? It looks like a partial index. They're oriented how someone would have gripped the knife. Your message said that you identified them. An FBI agent? These are Mulder's prints? Are you sure? Excuse me. No, that's okay. You can just throw it on the floor. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, sir. No, sir. I'm not altogether certain. Yes, sir. No, sir. I know Agent Mulder is working very hard on this case at No... sir.  Mulder? Where are you? Are you with Nemhauser? Well, that's who I was calling. He left this number on my Mulder? Do you know where he is? Mulder, that knife that we recovered at the crime scene, Because Mostow's was stolen from evidence. I was hoping you could tell me. Your prints were all over it. Why? Yeah, but why? Okay, Mulder. Listen to me carefully. I want you to stay Mulder! What the hell are you doing? First, put the gun down. Help me understand why you have a gun on Agent Mulder! You okay, Mulder? We should call an ambulance. His pulse is still strong. What a way to go. Have you seen this MO before, Detective? His name was Johnny Lo. He moved here about six months  I think it's pretty clear this I don’t know. So now we’re chasing ghosts? So you're saying that the ancestral spirits pushed Johnny Lo  It's still tacky. Someone's been here. This place has been cleaned out. Maybe it's this new carpet. What slumlord would spring for a new carpet in a dump What's this? And what about this? I couldn't tell you what any one of these things are. Does she remember Johnny Lo or remember selling it to him? What was that about? What about you, detective? What were they doing here? I still don't understand what anybody would want with an A lot. And I haven't even finished my preliminary visual If you ask me, nothing. Do you know how much the human body is worth, Mulder?  It's worth a fortune. A kidney, a portion of the liver, a cornea bone marrow... No, but if I’m right this is one man who left his heart in I only saw one body, but the only thing that wasn't burned Oh, God. Maybe you can tell us. It was found in the body cavity of You said the frog was a symbol of luck and prosperity. Maybe you can tell me this
 have you heard any word on This man with the frog in his chest was missing a cornea Either you resent us being here or you feel some kind of Mr. Hsin, can I ask what happened to your eye? Mr. Hsin, you laid a carpet in an apartment that was We contacted the man that you work for. He said it must His name was Johnny Lo. He's dead now-- murdered-- Do you remember who called you about the job? What’s up? That this guy didn’t have an accident at work. I say we monitor Hsin’s every movements. Look like you just saw a ghost. He hasn’t left his apartment, has he?  Well, you can use the one down at Detective Chao was attacked in his town house tonight. I don’t know, but I think we should go check it out. How is he? Why would he just take off? You want to see what his injuries were? His blood type? You think Chao’s involved?  Uh, O-negative. That the blood that we found on the carpet padding in the Mr. Hsin. We're looking for Mr. Hsin. Is he home? Are you his daughter? May we talk to you? You're sick, aren't you? But that's a treatable form of cancer.  This is from the Organ Procurement Organization. Thanks. We need some information and we need it as You had a man come in here named Shuyang Hsin. Yeah. That’s where the doctor’s phone is registered. Or sterile ice. What is that? He’s still alive. No ghosts called to those men. You did, by preying on You cheated them out of life by promising them prosperity I understand this. What about his daughter? That's great. What's wrong? And? What about Chao? His testimony would be enough. Agent Doggett. That was my question. Well, from what I could see from my visual exam the skin was removed Is there anything else ... Agent Reyes? Something special that Most of these are post-mortem skinnings. Wait a minute. What's this? It's just ... there's a pattern. There's a pattern ... the way the 1960. Excuse me. Dr. Mueller? Dr. Bertram Mueller? My name is Dana Scully. I'm with the FBI. I want to ask you some Sir, this particular victim was skinned alive. Sir, I haven't located police records from the investigation. Was I don't understand. And no one called him on that? Why do you say that? If so, it's the most perfectly executed that I've ever seen. And I'm sorry? Agent Reyes, I got a call from Agent Doggett. He said there's Well, if you're up for it, I've got something to show you. Case More skinned bodies ... cut with the same precision as the body I I need you to come to Quantico right away, Monica. I have something to show you. Agent Reyes. I showed you files of men killed in 1960 skinned alive like the Yes, there are cuts in the bone ... on the tibias and on the Well, it's even weirder than that. (Both women leave the autopsy Mm-hmm. But look at the date that they died. Birth dates of Victor Potts and Terry Pruit. Potts and Pruit were He's trying. We all are. It's just a long way to go from this... You mean in a future life? And Lisa Holland? What about her? And you? Well, maybe in this life you succeed. Mulder, he knows about your sister. Stop right there, sir! Mulder! Mulder! Mulder! Uh... I don't know... Please, I don't know. Scully. I'm right where you left me, Mulder. Because you wouldn't answer your phone and because I didn't Yes, I'm fine. Mulder... Mulder, he's coming after you. The man you left for dead. Sir. I heard that you were looking for me. We're fine, sir. We've been searching for this man, Jeremiah No. I'm afraid we haven't exactly formulated any clear suspicions, Sir? How much of it is there? Could it be some kind of cryptograph? I'd like to get a copy of a portion of this. I might be able Maybe. There's somebody I want to run it by. No. I think, sir, this is more along my field of expertise. How did you know I was here? I don't know. Concern him how? Has something happened to her? Is she in danger? From whom? Not until you give me some information first. All beginning with the letters S-E-P. You know what these are. Smallpox? What's that supposed to mean? Are you busy, Agent Pendrell? Good, because I think I've made some headway on this data. Can "SEP." Smallpox Eradication Program. I got lucky, but the key is in this first string of letters. You say "a twenty-letter code" to any scientist, and they immediately Cowpox virus... the virus used to inoculate humans against smallpox. I haven't worked that out yet, but the big question is this An inventory. Of us. Actually, it's an image created by what's called a confocal From me. I had a biopsy taken from the smallpox vaccination What I'm saying is that I think this protein is a tag... some Not just me... all of us... quite possibly anybody who's been I had my doubts... and I'm still not certain. But I performed I don't know, but it would have to be a government agency. I don't know that either, and I think the only man who might I am a scientist, sir. What I'm promoting in there is reductive I'm in Skinner's office, where are you? Just tell me where. Mulder, I don't... Who? Oh, believe me, Mulder, you're going to have it. There's a lot of people who want to talk to Jeremiah Smith. Something's wrong. Something happened. Oh, my God... Mulder... Oh, dear... no... he's freezing. He's in, you're in shock, Mulder. As long as she's lying here, you can't give up on her. I don't We don't know that, Mulder. You can't blame yourself for what I've seen things too. But there are answers to be found now. Nothing happens in contradiction to nature, only in contradiction I feel it too. I know it. I was warned...    Who's taking credit for it?    Uh, Christ's Church.  Isn't that, uh, Cardinal O'Fallon's church?    Um...  He's one of the most powerful men in the church today.        Of course, I'm too young to remember but, uh, wasn't he some    Just paperwork.    Mulder, we should have a warrant.    Mulder, sorry to denigrate a third of your Trinity, but, uh, looks    Yeah, well, it appears he was a master calligrapher as well.    Well, it's pretty rusty but it looks like some kind of lost    Yeah. It's a heretical text, Mulder-- mythical, I should say,    I think the question is
 What would Hoffman be doing forging I'm sure this place is crawling with rats.    Now, Wayne, I'm sure that it was dark in there and that your    You know, Mulder, I... I know that Federman's bs-ing you,    We had this wacky nun in Catholic school-- Sister Callahan--    Well, she would hold up an old piece of wood with a rusty nail    Well, she would tell this story of when Jesus raised Lazarus    ...who was spinning a clay bowl on a wheel nearby and that       Well, Sister    What is it?    Wow.    We're not sure.  Either a forger by the name of Micah Hoffman       Scully.       Why?       Oh, Mulder, this bowl.  Your buddy Chuck Burks       I'll call you after the autopsy.    Fracturing of skull and surface abrasions initially consistent    Oh, my God.    Who are you?    Ow!  Damn it!    In Micah Hoffman's stomach there were traces of red wine and    Mmm.    It's possible, Mulder.    Mulder... Let's allow the man some dignity, okay?    Let's get this over with.    Oh, my God.    Mulder...  Do you see what I see?    Is that Micah Hoffman?    Sir, the dead man looked very much like Micah Hoffman.    We're off this case, Mulder.    That's the language that Christ spoke.      What is it?    Lazarus?    So, uh... you created a Christ in these forgeries that was more    So why didn't O'Fallon and the Elders go outside the church for    Remorse?    Plan 9 From Outer Space?    How about Hoffman's Roadrunner to O'Fallon's Wile E. Coyote?    Mulder...    Do you think it's at all possible that Hoffman is really Jesus    No.    Well, yes, I know that.    Maybe true faith is really a form of insanity.       No.  I'm directing it at myself and at Ed Wood.    How...?    You've seen this movie 42 times?    Doesn't that make you sad?  It makes me sad.       California, here we come.    Hi.       Hey, Mulder, it's me.  What are you doing?       I'm, uh, packing.  Just, you know, getting ready for       Well, that's because people can't really come back       Oh, I see.  So it's just that we never get       Yeah.       Wow, he's really gone Hollywood.       You know, Mulder, speaking of Hollywood, I think       I think that Shandling likes you a bit, too.    Shh, Mulder, sit down.    Been looking all over for you.    I got a page from the Washington Bureau.  Micah Hoffman was    Wow... It's all over now.    Pretty silly.    Well, hopefully, the movie will tank.    I think the dead are beyond caring what people think about them.    Well... We're alive.  And we're relatively young and Skinner was    That he has given us a Bureau credit card to use for the evening.    Come on.    Mulder, I have something to confess.    I'm in love with Associate Producer Walter Skinner. Compression marks indicate the shovel blade to be approximately Mulder, if you had to do without a cell phone for two minutes, Be like living in Mayberry. Do you have any thoughts or, uh, suspects? Well, were there any local women who were pregnant and now suddenly You suppose? Have you questioned the men? It is, however, the closest residence to the crime scene. Well, they could've witnessed... Uh, I could use a little more elbow room. Oh, my God... Mulder... it looks as if this child has been afflicted Well, I don't know about that. Imagine all a woman's hopes and dreams for her child and then I, I guess I was just projecting on myself. No. What about your family? But from what I know from about genetic defects, Mulder, it's Those defects, Mulder, are autosomal dominant disorders, and But he also implied that they practice inbreeding. Now we all There are theories which pose that our bodies are, are simply But if the instinct and the need is strong enough, they will No, there's no probable cause. And check any prior missing-persons for a woman, and check the What about missing persons reports? Sheriff... Well, uh, we'll check on those in the morning. You get some You still planning on making a home here? Well, just as long as a brutal infanticide doesn't weigh into Mulder, this lock is broken. Damn it. The lab screwed up the DNA test on the infant. Yeah, but this shows far too many gene imbalances. It would Mulder... only one sperm in thousands from a single individual No. For that to be even remotely possible, there'd, there'd Mulder, that would take a whole day. I think they, they may Hang on a second, Mulder. Why... why would the Peacocks kill But how would they know? He, he issued the warrants by phone. Exactly. How could they know? Yup, they're up there. Are these vests absolutely necessary, deputy? I don't see anybody inside. Pastor, no! Even though we have the firearms, I imagine the place is rigged I don't know... "nah-ram-ewe." I baby-sat my nephew this weekend. He watches "Babe" fifteen Federal agents! Is anybody in here! Let's move the bed. Mulder, she already is home. It's Mrs. Peacock. She's their Well, what about her? I mean, we, we may not be able to move her, Mulder. She doesn't We're only assuming. We can't prove anything. Mrs. Peacock? Whatever pain you may be... What about you? Even after the accident? Mrs. Peacock, they murdered Sheriff Taylor and his wife. And Mulder! Mulder, look. I've notified the state police and the highway patrol, they've I'm Special Agent Dana Scully, and this is Special Agent Fox Mulder. I'm sure I don't have to point out to you, Detective, that the FBI has jurisdiction over the murder of a federal employee.  Where was the victim found? The supraspinatus and the deltoideus appear to be shredded from the torso, not severed, as do the other points of separation. Well, I don't think that would be possible for a... for a single human being.  Bill, I'm at a crime scene. Is everything okay? Are you still in Germany? Okay. Okay. That was, uh... that was my brother. He just... The EMTs found his phone number. Uh, my mom's just had a heart attack. She's in ICU in DC. Yeah. Mom. Yes, I'm her daughter. I'm Dana  Scully. Charlie's... my brother, her youngest son. They were estranged. She didn't ask for me, or, or Bill? Or her grandchildren? Hi, Mom. It's me, Dana. I'm here. I've been where you are. I know that Ahab is there. And Melissa. But, Mom, I'm here. Bill Jr.'s here. And William. William's here. And Charlie... is here. Please, Mom, don't go home yet. I need you.  Hey, Bill. What time is it where you are? What time is your flight from Frankfurt?  Oh. I think you should get here as soon as you can.  Oh, I can't... How am I to know that?  I-I won't answer as to whether she's going to die before you get here.  Bill, yes, I'm a doctor, but I'm also her daughter.  Well, we'll keep her on life support. That's... that's what she wanted.  Yes. Mom and I talked about it after my experience in a coma.  She said that she wanted us to do everything that we could to keep her alive.  Her advance directive is on the Living Will Registry.  Yes. Nurse? Is it wise to administer a hypertonic saline to a cardiac arrest patient? Yeah.  She asked for Charlie, before she fell into the coma. Yeah. Just him. Not Bill or me or... I don't even know where he is. He hasn't bothered with her or with us for years. Why would she do that? And why would she change her living will without talking to me? And what's this? Oh. I've never seen her wear it.  The-the-the date has no significance. It's not any of our birthdays. It's not dad's death or Melissa's. I mean, what is it about that quarter that she would frame it to put it around her neck? I don't care about the big questions right now, Mulder. I just want one more chance to ask my mum a few little ones. Back in the day, did... we ever come across the ability to just... wish someone back to life? You're a dark wizard, Mulder.  Hello?  Charlie.  Did Bill call you? Yeah. Um... Mum asked for you. Charlie, can you just say something to her, please? Just anything. I don't know. Just...  Do what I can't do.  Bring her back to us.  Okay. I'll put it on speakerphone. I've got Charlie here. He's on the phone. I know you can hear him. Anything? Any reaction? Mom? She just opened her eyes.  Mom? Mom? Mom. Mom, it's Dana. Mom, I'm here. I'm here. Come back to us. Mom? Mom? Mom. No! You get that out of here! Get that out of here! Her last words to us... were about our child. Her grandchild. That we gave away. Why did she say that? Why did she have to say that? Mulder, let's drive to Philadelphia. I need to work. Yes. Right now. Mulder, right now. I need to work right now. Product locator indicates there's only one store in Central Philadelphia that carries it. Damn! Mulder, back in the day, I used to do stairs and in three-inch heels. What the hell?  William. Our son, Mulder. I gave him up. You are responsible. If you made the problem, if it was your idea... then you're responsible. You put it out of sight, so that it wouldn't be your problem. But you're just as bad as the people that you hate.  We're looking for Daryl Landry... There's one way out of this room. He just screamed seconds ago. How did we not see whoever did this to him leave the room? I know now why Mom asked for Charlie, even though he was out of her life. She wanted to know before he left that he'd be okay. She gave birth to him. She made him. He's her responsibility. And that's why she said what she said to us. She wanted to make sure that we'd be responsible, to know that William's okay. Even though we can't see him. I know that, as parents, we made a difficult sacrifice, to keep him safe. That it was for his own good to put him up for adoption. But I can't help but think of him, Fox. I can't help it. I believe that you will find all of your answers. You will find the answers to the biggest mysteries, and I will be there when you do. But my mysteries... I'll never have answered. I won't know if he thinks of me, too, or, if he's ever been afraid and wished that I was there. Does he doubt himself because we left him? What questions does he have of me? The same that I have with this quarter? And I want to believe... I need to believe, that we didn't treat him like trash.    Sorry.  Checkout lines were worse than rush hour on the 95.    On Christmas Eve?    No kidding.    Mulder, I've got wrapping to do.  It's the night before Christmas.    Let's hear it.  Give me the details.    Mulder, I drove all the way out here.  I might as well know why.    Who lives in the house?    Then who are we staking out?    They've come back?    I see.  The dark, gothic manor the, uh, omnipresent low fog    Mulder, tell me you didn't call me out here on Christmas Eve    Mulder, call it what you want.  I've got holiday cheer to spread.    Okay.       You said that.    Go on.    And what happened to them?    They killed themselves?    It's a good story, Mulder... And very well told but I don't    That surprises you?    Mulder, if it were any other night I might let you talk me into    What are you doing?  Mulder, don't you have somewhere to be?       I'm not going to do it.  My New Year's    Mulder!    Did you take my car keys?    Come on, Mulder. Don't kid around.    Maybe you, uh... Maybe you grabbed them by mistake.    There must be a window open upstairs.  You know, the weather       Mulder, will you quit trying to scare    Mulder, I really have to go.    I'm not afraid, okay?    You are not scaring me, Mulder.    Look, I really have to get home.   Mulder...    These are tricks that the mind plays.  They are ingrained    I mean, Mulder, it doesn't take an advanced degree in    All right.  I'm afraid... but it's an irrational fear.     Thank you.   Mulder, did it occur to you that there aren't ghosts here but    But when you and I were sitting out in the car there was not a    Mulder, did you happen to notice the clock downstairs is    And how do you explain that?    This fire has just gone out.    Don't look so disappointed.    Mulder, it's not enough that it's haunted?  It has to be cursed?    Mulder?    That's not funny!    What are you going to do?    Mulder, don't.    Not now.    Oh, my God.    It's a woman.    Mulder, it looks like they were shot to death.    You know what's weird?    Mulder, she's wearing my outfit.    Yeah, well, you know what?  He's wearing yours.    That's us.    This is the same room.    You go through that door and I...    Right.    Mulder!    Mulder?    I'm a federal agent! I'm armed.         I'm armed.         I'm armed.    Please, I'm a little on edge.  Don't come any closer.    I can assure you that I'm not.  I, uh, I got stuck in this room    You've seen him?    Oh... That was you.      I am sorry... I'm sorry.  I didn't mean    Right...      Who are you?    Where's my partner?    There were corpses right there underneath the floor!    I don't believe in ghosts.    It's my partner.    Yeah.    Don't come any closer.    What?    You don't know me.  And you don't live here.    Well, then why is all the furniture covered?    Well then where's your Christmas tree?!    Hold it right there.  Don't make me shoot you.    Where's Mulder?    Where is he?    Move over there.       Both of you, move.    Put your hands up.    Stay away from me. Look, I want you to get me out of here.    What have you done with him?!    Look, all I know is this is just some bad dream.    Mulder!    Where did you get those?    Where did you get those keys?    I'm here, Mulder!       Open the door.    I don't believe you.   Just open the door.    Open the door!    Mulder?    Mulder, what are you doing?     Mulder!    Mulder, come on... Mulder, don't come any closer.    I'm not going to shoot you!  I don't want to shoot you!    Mulder, look... We don't have to do this.    We can get out of here.    I don't believe what you're saying!  Mulder, I don't believe a    Mulder!      Mulder... Is that you?    I didn't believe it, Mulder.    I didn't believe that you'd do it... That I would...    Merry Christmas, Mulder.    ( whispering as she lowers the gun and falls back on to the    Are you afraid, Mulder?    I am.    You should have.       I didn't shoot you.  You shot me.    What?    I can't.    What?    I, uh... I couldn't sleep.  I was, um...     Mulder... None of that really happened out there tonight...    Mmm. Not that, uh, my only joy in life is proving you wrong.    Well... Why else would you want me out there with you?    No, I mean... Maybe I did want to be out there with you.    Mulder...    Well, I got you a little something, too. What happened to him? Imagine going through your whole life looking like this. I guess I didn't realize that sideshows were still in existence. You know, this town's history might help explain our case's history. A sideshow performer would have toured much of the country over the years. And their isolation from everyday society caused by their physical deformities could have built up pathological resentments so intense that murder might be... Until their arrests, many serial killers are considered by their friends and family to be quite "normal." If you truly regard these people as normal, then you must also consider the possibility that they are capable of committing these crimes. What's the Feejee Mermaid? Do you recall what Barnum said about suckers? Did it not bother you to have other people staring at you? Mulder, what is this Feejee Mermaid business? As long as you try not to let the atmosphere of this town distort your list all out of proportion. Why run a test on the victim's blood? Why would there be blood before the attack? Fortunately, none. You must be one of those rare individuals whose... nerve endings don't register pain. Is this... man also a body manipulator? Human flesh? Thank you. I was just reading about the fascinating life of Chang and Eng and wondering if their death was just as fascinating. And what was the official cause of Eng's death? Do you have any information on blockhead or geek acts? Like magicians? "Gaffs?" Sort of like the Feejee Mermaid? What does this have to do with the Glazebrook murder? And the second favor? Oh, it's you. Is Mister Nutt finished with the plumbing? Well, I ended up running a bit of a background check myself. On an orphan discovered in the wild forest of Albania in 1943. "Although physically adept at catching his own food, he could not speak a word, save for a few savage grunts. Brought to this country, he was exhibited behind a locked cage, necessitated by his feral ferocity, where he would terrify onlookers by devouring chunks of raw meat." However, for reasons I could not ascertain, he ran away from the circus and spent a vague number of years mysteriously roaming about, supporting himself through a number of non-descript jobs. Eventually, he wound up in Gibsonton, where he took up a career in law enforcement and has spent the past four terms serving as sheriff. I'm telling you that before becoming Sheriff Hamilton, James Hamilton was Jim-Jim, the Dog-Faced Boy. What are you implying? It's like assuming guilt based solely on skin color, isn't it? Sheriff, it, it's, it's been documented that many serial killers possess a fascination with police work, some of them even holding positions on their local force... so surveillance of investigation team members is often utilized as a precautionary... So that is you. That doesn't quite explain the potato. You know, Mulder... Mister Swaim, federal agents, we're here to qu... Mister Swaim, we're here to take you into custody to question you about some recent murders. Sir, if you're going to be uncooperative, I'll have to handcuff you. Did I not mention we're federal agents? Mulder, are you okay? No, I don't think he's going to sleep this one off. No one got in, but some one got out. I'm not sure myself, Mulder, but I think we'll know more when we find Leonard. Lanny's brother. No, the twin extracted itself. Yeah, Mulder... this wound is identical to the other victims' wounds. With one exception. He's not bleeding. You said it yourself, Sheriff. It's what's inside that counts. I have a feeling that Lanny has an internal anomaly that allows his conjoining twin to disjoin Lanny, why does he attack other people? How long can he survive outside of your body? Too mobile. I'll cover the back. I think we better go outside and catch this thing coming out. Are you all right? You're taking off? They've been searching for it all day. It can't have sustained itself for this long. No, his brother Lanny died last night. I already performed the autopsy on him this morning. His body wounds were non-fatal. He died as a result of advanced cirrhosis of the liver. Well, his body possesses some anatomical discrepancies... some offshoots of the esophagus and trachea that almost seem umbilical in nature and... I've never seen anything like it. Remind people of what? No, why? Hope it's nothing serious.    FBI. Special Agents Scully and Mulder.    Sir, would you do us a favor and gather your employees, please?    Well, this was also found in the car.    Thirty-two.    I don't believe that we said the victim was male.    Somehow, I don't think Lucky Boy would make that list.    I guess.  So what are you saying, Mulder?  This place has    You're saying Mr. Pankow had his brain very neatly removed    But next to the shake machine, Mulder?  I think that we should    Yeah, but Mulder, we're in Orange County.       Through an inch-and-a-half opening that looks    The proboscis of what?    Yes, it looks like it.    No, I'd say that's ground beef.    Yeah.    Sir, may we speak with you?    Derwood Spinks has disappeared.    My partner saw Spinks in your neighborhood yesterday    Thank you, Mr. Roberts.  We'll contact you if we have any    About what?    What didn't he want you to tell us?    He was last seen parked outside your apartment.    Oh, my God.    Dr. Rinehart, step away from him. What happened up there? Is it severe isolation distress? There's no football on Wednesday. Dr. DaSilva, Dr. Hodge? Hi, Agent Mulder, Agent Scully... I assume you all took a look at the tape. Where do we start? Flashing. You okay? Look at this. Black nodules. Swollen lymph nodes. This dog has got a skin irritation on it's neck. Look at this, look at this! From the autopsies, it's clear that these men killed each other. No. None of them had the black nodules. I analyzed two samples. There seems to be a presence of ammonium hydroxide in Richter's That same thing is in Richter's blood. The evidence is there. Hey, look, there's only one way to proceed. A good doctor eliminates We can't let him leave without him being checked. Well, we don't have time to argue about it. What are you gonna do? He's dead. All of the other dead bodies had the creature. This is the only No. It appears that they were in the hypothalamus gland deep It's a gland that secretes hormones although I don't know why Well, a parasite shouldn't want to kill it's host. If the worm makes people violently aggresive then why did Richter I'm just, uh... double-checking. Making sure I didn't miss anything. Sleep. I'm so tired I can't sleep. Mulder, I don't want to waste a second trying to find a way No. Mulder, that pilot developed surface symptoms within a few minutes. Mulder, if we don't kill it now, we run the risk of becoming Future? Mulder, how can you talk about the future when right ...about them posing a biological hazard! It can! By extermination, we should take those bodies, worms Yes, I'm fine. It's nothing. What the hell are you trying to say? No. We do them in front of each other. No secrets. Good night, Mulder. At least everyone's okay. Mulder, what are you doing? No, he said he didn't do it. You checked him yourself, Hodge. Stop it! Just stop it, shut up! Then just turn around and let us take a look at your neck! Mulder! Mulder, you have to understand! You put it down first! Mulder... you may not be who you are. You know what I was doing. There's four of us. If Mulder is infected, it's not his fault! We can't turn our This is A.I.C.P. calling Doolittle Airfield, please come in. Hodge. Come take a look at this. The larvae from two different worms Look at the evidence in the microscope. This thing does not I want to talk to him first. Try to make this voluntary. If anything happens, you come inside. I can't do this to him Yes. No one's been killed since you've been in here. We found a way to kill it. Two worms in one host will kill each  If that's true, then why didn't you let us inspect  Okay. But now they're not here. I just examined him. He's... uninfected. Which means that it must be one of you. Hodge! Now! It's all right. It's all over. It all stops right here. Right Who did that? Leave it there. Agent Reyes? What are you doing? Why would I think that you're crazy? No. Because I don't think that its complexity allows for it to be reduced so simply. I presume you mean the so-called Unified Theory, what physicists often refer to as the theory of everything. An equation so simple they say that it might be printed on a T-shirt. It's a holy grail in the world of science. Potentially the most important question that mankind has ever asked. But that such a complex calculation is even possible is a subject of enormous controversy. Is that what you mean? Agent Reyes, if there's a connection that I'm supposed to be seeing, I'm not seeing it. Agent Reyes, am I to presume that you've solved these unsolved murders by using some kind of numerical calculation? Numerology, Agent Reyes... You're trying to solve these cases by using what is essentially a child's game. And, uh, when exactly did you stumble upon it? So in other words, you haven't actually solved these cases. Without any other evidence to directly connect them, circumstantial or forensic. Can you enlarge this?  Can I see the rest of those photos? There's a pattern in the bruising. All four of the victims have it. Three small circles. It might be from a ring that the killer wears. Or that maybe you're both crazy. The killer is strong. He uses his fists as weapons. Brute force. He is angry and he acts on impulse. The deceased is Vicki Louise Burdick. Upon external examination, cause of death appears to be a fatal blow to the maxilla, in which a small three-ring pattern lies. I will begin my internal examination at six-oh-six PM I've got something to show you. I figured out what the triple zero pattern on the victim is. They aren't zeroes at all. It's the number 6-6-6, only worn away.  It must be stamped on the killer's ring. 6-6- 6, the work of the devil. I didn't. Completely by accident. Uh... And how did the killer find her? And how does that help us find the killer? Despite what we know about the victim's numerology, about the ring that we think that he wears, we really know next to nothing about where to start looking for this man. You going down? Thank you. Get out of the elevator!! Move!! It's him. Stairs. Great. We have to get an APB out on that car. Did you happen to see a plate? We've got all the numbers on this case except for the ones we need. Well it's only midnight. There's gotta be somebody coming in or out soon. We're Federal Agents and we're armed! If you are here, and you make any sudden moves, we will be forced to consider you a threat. Stay where you are! Right there! Step out around the back of the car. I want you to show us some identification. Sir, what are you doing here? At midnight, in a parking garage? Sir, does it look like we're here to play checkers? All right. Let's pop the trunk. What's all this? Sir, enough. What time is your friend coming? I don't know. I don't know. We happen to be here, Sir, because there is a serial killer on the loose. We're not, stuck down here. Do you have the combination to the door?  How did we get ourselves into this? Agent Reyes? I don't believe it. Who are you? You're part of this. Keep your hands up. I don't know. Will you just... No, that's... that's not what she means.  She thinks that his acts are determined by a calculation of numbers. No. It's not. Agent Reyes. You can't reduce a complex factor as physical and psychological into a game. Agent Reyes, that is utter nonsense, okay? It would mean that all we are are checkers on a checker board being moved around by some ... forces completely outside and unbeknownst to us. Nor does he play checkers.  Look, Agent Reyes, you can't reduce all of life, all creation, every piece of ... of art, architecture, music, literature... into a game of win or lose. But the killer is outside, killing, and we are stuck in a parking garage. What are you lookin' at? You go left and I'll go right.  You? You stay right where you are. He's going fast. Can you hear me?  How did you ever find us?  All right. I need to know.  What my numerology is. My number. Whatever you call it. What am I?  Which means what?  There's something else that's buggin' me.  Who was that man?    I'm just going to shine this light in your eyes, okay?  You're doing great.       Okay.  Well, what we've got here is a    Mr. and Mrs. Underwood?    Yes. I'm Agent Scully, and this is Agent Doggett.  We are, uh, investigating    Mrs. Underwood... whatever your son has been through, it has somehow    Uh...    Mr. Underwood...?    You think this is a game?    Have you really worked kid cases before, Agent Doggett?  Child    This isn't just a horror story.  This is a biological impossibility.    You are ignoring the fact that he is still seven years old.    I told you...  he's not sick.    You going to sleep here, too?    I spoke with the doctors who treated Billy.  I looked at his charts.    Yes and no.  What showed up is that Billy is the same boy who was taken    No.  I mean the –same-  boy.  He has no cavities. He has no tooth decay.  He    It's medically impossible.    There are … X-File cases that describe similar paranormal findings.  Alien    I'm not saying that I can explain it, Agent Doggett, but this is definitely not    What's your interest in this guy?    These are juvenile records.  These are sealed by the court, Agent Doggett.       Yeah, and you're breaking the law.    No. Billy wasn't cut either.    Well, I hate to say this … but I think that the best thing for Billy and his    This is not a normal child, Agent Doggett, and this is not a normal act.    And what's the message?    Yes, he's a kid, Agent Doggett, you're right.  He's a kid who materialized out    I've seen this symbol before, too.    I understand your misgivings, Mr. Underwood, but perhaps you can look at    Ms. Pearl?  Are you okay?    She's having a grand mal seizure.]    Oh, my god.    Well, they've got her stabilized and it looks like she's going to be okay... if    Believed what?    You think that was an act?    You saw that symbol appear on her forehead.    No.  I think you want to hear this.    Now listen to it backwards.    It's a child singing.    Lyrics.    You hear that, under the noise?   Now...    Get out of the car!  Now!    I thought you said Billy was in the car?    Count to ten, Agent Doggett.       He couldn't have.    By the certain knowledge that not five minutes earlier, I saw him enter his    It's impossible, Agent Doggett, like everything else about this case.  Like    Agent Doggett...  He's on the run.    Okay, the clothes, the age and condition of the bones, the location of the    I know, but the forensic evidence is going to come out, and what then?    Look, I know where you are with this.  I have been there.  I know what    But maybe that's explanation enough.  That that's not Billy's brother lying in    All I'm saying is that maybe you succeeded... whether you're willing to see Yeah... I've read about cases of desecrating the dead, but Why do they do it? How that didn't shock you back there. Mulder, we flew three hours to get here. Our plane doesn't Did you get your forensics report on this one? I'll be right with you. I need a minute. The time is eleven fourteen AM, Monday, November 14th. The deceased Hello. Mulder, can I have a minute with you? I think I might better drive this investigation if I focused That I take the body back to Washington. I'd like to run it I'm not having trouble, Mulder. I'm fine with it. Really. I just think we're a long way from The body was shipped on my flight. I should be here within I've got a flight back to Minneapolis booked for tonight. But You think you find a way to deal with these things. In med school, No. Was I? Probably as another way of trying to detach myself from it. No. No.  I know it sounds crazy, but I don't want him to I had a meeting. What did you find? Who? Did you tell him about the print? Hi, it's me. We got a print. No. I'm coming back tonight. I'm okay with it, Mulder. You can use my help. I'm okay.    Morning.    Nice to meet you.    Look, Mulder, all I'm saying is...    But there is a condition called microstomia-- "small mouth"-- which is, uh,       Well, there's always nasal aplasia-- the complete absence of a    Yeah, but what we're talking, Mulder, is medical-- physiological-- not    Mulder...    That's a little... out of place, wouldn't you say?    Hi. We're looking for a Mr. Anson Stokes.    Well, do you happen to know when he's coming back?    Well, we are, uh, Agents Mulder and Scully from the FBI.        Okay...    And the, uh... unfortunate condition that he's found himself in.  Would you    Chemicals?    Okay.    Well, according to Gilmore he was standing right where I am when it    Apparently, everything is left as it was.    Well, it's too bad, Mulder.  Underneath all this dust, this furniture is really    Mulder, this furniture is expensive, very expensive.    My point is that, uh... there's a lot of money sitting around here and maybe    I don't know-- jewelry.  I mean, Anson Stokes opened up this storage unit    Mm-hmm. There's your crime
 Theft.    Well...    Ouch.    That's the woman from the trailer.    Mm-hmm.    It is.  His dental records are a match.  He was found about half a mile from    Yes, he is.    You know, Mulder, in the seven years that we've been working together I    Yeah.    How's that?    You don't mean what I think you mean?    Well, what does any of that have to do with this?    But how?    Uh, I think that I should stay here with the body.  I mean, I... you know, I       Bye.    I have a group of researchers flying in from Harvard Medical.  Can't wait to    What's this?    Benito Mussolini.    Your mystery woman.  Or someone who looks a lot like her.    Well, even if it is her, Mulder, what would she be doing with Mussolini?    You're not going to believe your eyes.  I certainly didn't.  You ready?    Uh, he's, uh...  he's invisible... after all... Um...    He's in there.    Oh, I should just shoot myself.  Oh...  I was so happy.  I was so excited.    I don't know what I saw, Mulder.  I do know that having that kind of proof    Why did the body disappear?    A wish?  Whose wish?    His brother, Leslie.    The, uh... the fire department just recovered two bodies.    Looks like it.  And, uh, Anson Stokes is visible now.    Of    But what I'd really love an explanation for is how his corpse got from my    I know what he'd say.  He'd say that you're some kind of a jinni from 1,001    500 years.    You're saying that you have been a firsthand witness to 500 years of human       "An Ifrit."    I can't think of anything we have to hold you on.  And, not surprisingly we    Skinner called me, Mulder.  Is everything all right?    No.    Mul...    Could you give us a minute, please?    Like today?    Wh … Where the hell did she go?    No... It's got to be hypnotism or mesmerism or … something.    I thought I did.    Mulder, all right, say...  say that you're right.  Say this is what it is.  Then       It sounds wonderful.    Maybe it's the whole point of our lives here, Mulder-- to achieve that.    Caddyshack," Mulder?    That's what every guy says.  It's a guy movie.    So, uh...  What's the occasion?    Cheers.    Well, I'm fairly happy.  That's something.    So what was your final wish, anyway? Well, this came in last night from US Customs. It's a blow-up from a security camera at the border Excuse me? Sir, he could be injured. Monica. Surprise, surprise. Well, actually he doesn't know that I'm here. Nor does he know that Skinner is headed to Mexico Perfect timing, I hope. Look what just got handed to me. (SCULLY Yeah, that's who placed the call. Does that sound familiar to you? We'll trace the call. Well, I'd never actually much considered it myself before I Yes, and I feel that I must apologize for his refusal to speak "The Lonely Buddha" is one of my favorite novels. What made you decide to write a book about an alien abduction Well... just as long as you're attempting to record the truth. What do you mean? So you're here to get my version of the truth? Well... not right away, of course. Um... not enough time had She was suffering from what my partner calls "missing time." Actually, I prefer neither, but my partner uses "abductee." Well, regardless, the girl was considered neither at the time. The father informed the police, who apprehended the boy back And he stuck to his story... until we got there. That should have ended our investigation, but Mulder brought So, my partner became convinced that she was suffering from Well, I think that stress of any kind can cause all of those I know that it has its therapeutic value, but it has never been One of the greatest thrillers ever written. Hmm. No one still knows. That's my problem with it, Mulder. It's all a little too typical. Well, of course, he didn't actually say "bleeped." He said... Harold... did you and Chrissy engage in consensual sexual intercourse So we know that it wasn't an alien who probed her. Mulder, you've It's a lot more plausible than an alien abduction, especially Why did you wait till now to tell us this information? Two kids' At which point? Unfortunately, I'm not sure that modern reconstruction of ancient In short, Roky showed signs of being what is known as a fantasy-prone How did you get a copy? It definitely was peculiar. Wh, wh, well, Mulder's had his share of peculiar notions. He's Who are you calling? Re-hypnotized? What for? So the girl was put under again to see if she could confirm Mulder, I think you and the hypnotherapist were leading her Wrap it up. You never saw this. This didn't happen. You tell anyone, you're That's ridiculous! I'm... and besides, we allowed him to view This is so embarrassing. But see? Whoever got ahold of this footage edited it in such No, but I found our alien's I.D. You were right, Mulder. Air Well, the major is dead. His body is being detained for further I don't see why no... So what else is new? The wound is situated to the left of the midline abdomen. The After not recovering the tape, Mulder was heading back to the Well, not after what happened when Mulder left the diner and Mulder, these gentlemen have something very important to tell Mulder didn't say that it was Alex Trebek. It was just someone Well, not exactly, I'm... I don't have any recollection of this. Scully. We'll be right there. I know it probably doesn't have the sense of closure that you I'll catch up.  They meant so much to me. I'm not sure if they ever really knew. It means that, like everyone buried here, the world is a better place for them having been in it.  It means that they're gone... but they live on through us all. His name was Isaac Luria. He lived in the Williamsburg And now Isaac Luria. He was murdered two days ago in In the VCR of a 16 year old named Tony Oliver. No, because he's dead. Apparently he was watching this Yeah. But with a new twist. The Brooklyn Homicide They belonged to Isaac Luria. Some people might assume that. It's probably what I think this is a crime of hatred like the crime that spawned it. And not a very good one. Somehow the killer got a hold of Isaac Luria's fingerprints Excuse me, sir. We're with the FBI. Is she home? We would like your permission to reopen Isaac's grave. We're looking for evidence in the murder of this young man. He's one of three suspects in the murder of your husband. Because this is a homicide investigation, sir, and you Sir, I'm afraid that even without your consent, we can get I'm afraid he knows who killed Tony Oliver, Mulder, and he Justice or revenge? Yes, but the right to free expression doesn't extend to murder. No, not directly, but these young men are and we have We work for the FBI, Sir. You take a long look at these photos. It may be your One of their accomplices, a man named Tony Oliver, You haven't heard the rumors? That Luria is back from the dead? We're just relaying the evidence, sir. You can draw your Ligature marks on the victim's neck are consistent with the I guess Clinton was here with Derek Banks. Maybe they came to desecrate the corpse as retribution Afraid? The body wasn't embalmed according to custom. Maybe Is it ever buried with the dead? There may be a possibility that moisture leaked its way A name? Jacob Weiss. There's been another murder. Another suspect in your Yesterday he expressed strong feelings towards this latest And we found evidence placing him at the crime scene. I'm sorry. It's beautiful. But your father survived. And through all this, he hid the ring? Why? Arial, tell us where your father is. What if you're wrong? Do you see him? I'm sorry. We don't mean any disrespect. We're with the FBI. We're looking for Jacob Weiss. Mulder... Don't move! Federal agent! You okay, Mulder? Put your hands in the air where I can see them. Mr. Weiss, we're placing you under arrest. Come on. Let's go. We've arrested him, Arial, under suspicion of murder. I think that's the direction it's going. Agent Mulder is in Arial, I think you'd better get him an attorney, he's Okay. You ask Detective Barley down the hall. Arial?  I'm sorry. You want to see the background check I ran? What do you mean? He gave a confession, I just stood Well, who? His daughter? Who do you think it was? Where are you going? Mulder, it's me. There's been another homicide. Herb Bjunes. I'm on my way to the print shop right now. Well, he wasn't toiling in obscurity. This manifest lists Yeah, I'll call the precinct and have him released. Oh, my God. It's Isaac Luria. He's still alive. No. That won't be necessary.  Well, the It was definitely his corpse in the grave. This video tape... But if Luria is dead, Mulder... Well, who do you think it is? Some kind of a ghost? A Golem? Mud!  Mulder, what are you talking about? It's not locked. Arial? How do you know? His pulse is thready. If we get him to a hospital.  Mulder... Are you okay? I heard shots fired.  What is she doing? Looks like they crashed the wrong party. Pico Salazar? A foreign national with his kind of connections? What Mulder, these are street level coke dealers... Minor wholesalers What would they be doing here?  It’S 2
45 in the morning. Who? And you recognize him? Why have I never heard of him? I still don’t see the connection. So, why was Gelman in there? You think this was a hit on him? Mulder, did you take a look at him? Why kill a man who  Mulder, that’s evidence. Is that why he disappeared?  "Twilight Time."  Anyone ùh, think to check his e-mail. "Invisigoth?" There must be a thousand containers here. .... and in no particular If not in their computer security. Mulder! Stop! FBI! FBI! Stop, or I’ll shoot! (Fires warning shot over Thank you.  Why don’t you let us ask the questions. Like what you’re doing here and what all this stuff is. You just committed felony assault on a federal agent, followed What is?  A weapons platform? You want us to believe that the Department of Defense wants You’re out of your mind. Mulder, this is absurd! Mulder!  No more screwing around. We need a name. "Urschleim in silicon?" And what was your role in all this? Were you the bass A better offer to do what? Jeez... You believe this load of crap? She could have rigged an explosive charge. There are no They were never built! We don’t even have that kind of How?  Your name is Esther Nairn? Aren’t you worried it’s going to track you, Esther? Hunt Why didn’t it just zap him, too? Unlike a dozen crack dealers. Why don’t you just call him.  T3?  Yep.  Dandy.  You are correct, sir.  In a manner of speaking. About you and who. What plans did he find out? So you were going to – But Donald Gelman forbade it. Well, maybe he wasn’t here when this happened. Maybe he’s I can’t get through to Mulder.  It can interfere with my phone? Wait a minute. Mulder said that he found the system. You can do that? Esther ...  Get away from  Sir? You need to get out of the truck. Esther! Dump it! (jumps onto bridge at the last Mulder, these women are spies! Mulder, they want the Kill Switch virus. What did you I need to know! Do we have it?  Mulder?! Mulder, are you all right? Mulder?  Mulder.  Mulder? Who built this? Mulder?  Mulder? Well, we don’t have it. You threw it in the water with That’s going to kill it, right? Give it what it wants, Esther.  Put it in! You’re going to be okay. I’m going to get you out of here. Okay. It’s okay. What are you doing, Esther? What are you doing? Esther?! Where are you? Well, if Esther wanted to leave her body, she got her wish. Mulder, she’s dead.  Mulder, are you telling me that Esther may have  Electrons chasing each other through a circuit To win makes him feel important. He likes to think of himself Extremely weakened. The doctors here say that he can barely Yeah, Mulder, I'm amazed he's even alive ... the condition Well, apparently one day about six months ago, he simply It still is. He has a physical therapist. Mulder ... what if Modell plans That it's exactly what he wants. That once again you're  It says here that Modell had a visitor It's marked LSC.  Mulder?  Time?  Don't let him rope you in. Mulder, hang up the phone. There's nothing back there. Appears as if he died from ingesting paint. I imagine that he  Cerulean blue. Maybe his choice of victim. This is Nathan Bowman with the Fox Mulder.  It's him. Why Bowman's wife? What would he want with her? Mrs. Bowman? Did your husband ever discuss his work as a Did he ever mention the name Robert Patrick Modell? Yes, sir. Mulder? Well, hopefully, he wasn't capable. Well, we've seen that before.  Where are you, Mulder? Mulder, what happened? Where's Modell?  About 10 minutes ago. He can't have  Yes, Agent Mulder's fine. Yes, sir. How are you feeling? It could have happened to anyone, Mulder. Which was what? Whose game? His? What are you talking about? Of course he is. You said He killed Nathan Bowman. Mulder, this man's affected you. He's influenced your thinking. A man is made to drink a gallon of cerulean blue paint. That's your opinion? How can you be sure it's your own? Your husband talked with you a lot about it. Is it possible that he could have mentioned you to Robert Modell? What? You tell me. Mulder, no. I'm sorry. You said it yourself, you said Mulder, I think you should do what he says.  Scully. Where are you? Mulder, you were told to lay off. It was Modell. Mulder ... Would have? You don't know that. Mulder, I'm not at the safe house. We're at the Chain Bridge Mall, investigating a suicide.   Back in the trucks ...  Did he try to speak to you? We haven't found the gun yet. For what possible reason? Linda Bowman? That's one hell of a plan, Mulder. A serial killer makes us They've taken her home. There is no reason to keep her in Where are you going? Mulder, talking to him has already done you enough harm. Mulder ...  Yes, we'd like an ambulance to 214 Channel She has an advanced temporal lobe tumor, just like Modell's. Fraternal twins. Apparently, she only found out about his existence six months  Relax, they’ll be here. Sure it wasn’t a bogus tip?  Just as long as you keep yours. Come on, Jack. No. You can’t give up on him. Go up to 400. I’m a doctor. Go up to 400, or I’ll do it myself. Give him another amp of EPI intracardial and go up to 400 Again. Come on, Jack. Any word from Willis? Yeah. Three fingers on Dupre's left hand were severed by Yeah, he lived the case. It was all he thought about, That maybe this is some kind of post-trauma psychosis. They met while she was serving a ten year sentence for Until the warden found out about their secret. According One week before the first robbery at Annapolis Savings Well, apparently they took turns --- one pulling a job while Well, we’re putting her face out there --- local newspapers, Yeah. Last May in Atlantic City. So what? It's a left thumbprint. What do you mean, "whoever"? It was Willis. I'm not sure where you're going. Just over 13 minutes. It could be anything – an instrument malfunction,  Two heartbeats. Right. Technically, but we resuscitated Willis.  Mulder. The usual stuff – the tunnel, the light, people rising up Some sort of disassociative, hallucinatory activity. Changed how? I don’t understand. What happened?  I don’t discount the near-death experience because it It’s my still best guess Jack’s disappearance can be The stress of the case, the trauma of being shot…..  We dated … for almost a year.  I believe it’s a long way from saying Jack had a near-death That’s Lula’s brother. What’s his story? Excuse me.  Jack…  Is there a problem here? It’s all right, Officer. This is Agent Jack Willis.  For God’s sake, Willis, what happened? I’m taking you back to the hospital. You’re not ready to be here. Jack. You’re recovering from a major trauma. Jack … As a matter of fact he was.  You did open the book on this one. All right. But as a colleague and as a friend I’m  You’re two months early. We do. You mean you tested him. What evidence?  And you think Willis is responsible? Can’t you accept the possibility that this isn’t an X-File? Like I said, Mulder, stress, all right? We both know it Jack. Where are you going? Hotline? Jack, can I ask you something?  The Phillips murder. The print Mulder And … you were carrying the evidence back. Number 202. Multrevich. Where’s 207? All right, Mr. Multrevich, we want you to go back inside Where’s our back up? You said you called them, right? I’m going to call in again. I’ll check back here. Face down! Face down! Hands behind your back. Now! She’s all yours, Jack.  I already cuffed her. What’s going on, Jack? Jack …  Mulder?  Don’t ---  It’s not going to work, Jack. Bureau policy prohibits negotiating with kidnappers. Your name is Jack Willis. You were born February 23, 1957. We spent a weekend up at Pine Barrens. You taught What did you see? You *are* my friend. No. We brought you back. No. You won’t kill me, Jack.  Soda. How much of that have you had? Jack Willis is diabetic. Which means you’re diabetic. Abdominal pain is the first sign of impending diabetic coma. Hold on. Without this medicine, he dies.  Hmn? Huh? Yes, Jack. There was lots of snow. It was December. It was the weekend after Thanksgiving.  Yeah. That’s right. There was a Yeah.  Yeah. No! Jack, don’t close your eyes. Come on, keep talking. No. No. He’s dead. It’s all on you now. He’s dead because of you. Jack! Jack, put the gun down. No! Jack!  Jack!? "Happy 35th, Love D." I got it for him three years ago. Uh .. no. Jack was an only child. Both his parents died Which is?  What am I supposed to tell  It’s not working. It stopped. At 6
47. What does that mean? Well, whoever happened to get locked in here last night, What about the morgue attendant? Mulder, what are we doing here? Yes. So? I mean, you’re not suggesting that My guess would be body snatching for profit. There’s There’s your perpetrator wearing a stolen uniform. Well, maybe he got spooked and was forced to abandon it. I’ll show you. All hospitals operate some form of medical waste processing. Well, that depends on how often they dispose of their  Mulder, I think Leonard Betts. Why did he take the time to dispose of the head? Well, we already know how he died. In an automobile While you do what? Lived. Case number 226897, Leonard Betts. As remains are Oh, God! Mmm.  It’s me. Um, I’ve run into  Uh, so far, not much. I uh, did  Well, this is cutting edge technology  Well, I … I haven’t exactly performed  Well. Because I, uh … I experienced  It blinked at me. I mean, I - I   No, I am certainly not saying that at  What do you mean?  Leonard Betts?  Without his head.  Mulder, I don’t even know how to respond This procedure is called biopolymerization. It’s  At any rate .. we should have some What?  Oh, my God. His entire He was riddled with it – I mean every - every cell in What are you suggesting? Are you ever asked to defend this as a legitimate scientific  "Coronal discharge?" And the theoretical basis of holistic medicine, of acupuncture, I don’t even know how to explain that photo or even what Mulder … I don’t know where you’re going with this? Well, even if that were possible, he’s been decapitated. You think that Leonard Betts regrew his head? Salamanders ore one thing, but no mammal possesses that Mulder, they’re worms. Well, unheard of or not, someone is going to great lengths  Scully … Yeah … Okay ..Great. Thanks. I had Danny run the fingerprints. Two names came Elaine Tanner? I’m Agent Scully. This is Agent Mulder, we’re with Is your son Albert Tanner?  Mrs. Tanner, is this your son? We know this man as Leonard Morris Betts. Are you Mrs. Tanner, are you aware that your son has recently Would it be possible to get a copy of the death certificate  Yeah. Michelle Wilkes was murdered, but, uh, we wouldn’t know I found a spent autoinjector in the grass. She was Well, the security guard did ID him as her attacker. Mulder, it just doesn’t work that way. But, but language, evolution – I - it’s a process of steps, What you’re describing is someone so radically evolved Oh, my God. Myeloid Sarcoma, Epithelial Carcinoma But that he needs it for survival?  Why do I think that Charles Darwin is rolling in his grave Betts’ mom. Elaine Tanner? We have a warrant to search the premises. Mrs. Tanner, We know that your son is alive and that you’re What reasons, Mrs. Tanner? Did you find something? Receipt for a storage locker. Let’s check it out. Mr. John Gilnitz. Death from massive blood loss Doing what? How would he have known that? Well, what ever he was doing he is taking the secret to Mulder, Leonard Betts is dead. Of that I am absolutely I don’t understand. Obviously, someone is lying. Maybe the first death Mulder, these men may be no more than monozygotic twins. Mulder, I don’t know what you’re getting at here. If this man really exists, what make you think he’d come Federal agents! What are you doing here? Stay here. Mulder, get the EMTs up here. She has an open wound, a surgical cut. Judging by the response time, he might still be here. She’s gonna be okay, Mulder. She’s not out of the Okay.   Mulder, it’s me. We’ve got Mrs. Tanner  Mulder, get over here right now.  Get over here now. Ahh! He’s dead?  Cancer?  I want to go home. It is advantageous to begin an autopsy with removal of the cranium. What this man imagined... his dreams, who he loved, saw, heard, Good afternoon, Agent Mulder. You know, Mulder, from... from back there, you look like him. Deep Throat. I wanted to talk but I haven’t found anything. Mulder, I haven’t seen any indication... I’ve taken all of the necessary precautions. I have doubled Because I realized that it was the only way that you would see To know that you’re all right. Mulder, you passed me today within Mulder, I know that you feel... frustrated that without the Well, what then? When the bureau first shut us down, you said Yeah. No. And you’re worried that all your life, you’ve been seeing elves? But, Mulder... during your time with the X-Files, you’ve seen Your sister’s abduction, you’ve held onto that. Mulder, even if George Hale only saw elves in his mind, the "Galactic latitude?" Are you following me? I was told by the Assistant Director that Mulder was gone. So, whenever he’s away, I feed his fish. Damn. That would be bad for the fish. The "wow" signal? What was there? Maybe you can tell me. Is that from Ohio State? Mulder. C.A 519. 7
05. 9
50. I’d like a ticket on the 6
30 flight to San Juan. I was sure you were dead. Mulder? It’s Scully. Dana Scully. Here? Proof of what? Is that them? We don’t have time. Mulder, we’re never going to be able to get the body out of Mulder... You know, an electrical surge in the outlet the storm may have The message said urgent. What is it you want me to look at here? Well, I have to say that, uh... I've never seen anything quite like Well, judging from the amount of insect faeces in the ear and nasal I may have to brush up on my "Spanish Fly" but I don't think the Dr. Bronzino ... These flies you mentioned neither of them are indigenous to North I'm glad you're here. I think we just got our first real break. Well, it's what the entomologist Rocky Bronzino found. The flies that Well, what are the chances of that? Well, something biological is going on. Whether it's hormonal or To what? Hmm. Lice are not altogether uncommon in a school environment. So what are you saying? That this is just another dumb ass stunt? How does one direct bugs? Excuse me? I'm aware of how pheromones work. But according to this device there Rocky. So what do you suppose they're reacting to out here? Yeah, I tend to agree with that, yeah. Fascinating. You know, Rocky ... I'm a mother. What is it? Where did you get this? I have to warn you, there's typically not a lot to be found in a Yes, it's what causes B.O., But all too obviously it's not all that Insect pheromone. Rocky? Okay, so this boy's going through puberty, right? I mean, maybe his Yes, but against what? Mrs. Lokensgard? Dylan? Well, I guess that's probable cause. I have. I got upstairs, you take down. Scully. I'm with ROCKY at the Lokensgard's house. But there's nobody here. How'd he do that? Yeah, Dylan's bedroom's up there. Unfortunately, he's not in it. The kid's on a rampage. You got my number, partner. Where are they? Natalie! Get down, stay down! I'll be right back. Excuse me. We've got paramedics on the way. This man has a puncture wound to his right lung. He needs to When you talked to your girlfriend, what did you say? Then there's someone inside. I don't know. That's Sergeant Louis Frish, he was the intended target. By whom? Military arrest? He has testimony that is damaging to the military. His life For what? Sir, the military is responsible for the downing of that plane. What is their story? I'm fine. Mulder. I came to talk to you. According to the military, there was no misunderstanding. They had no choice, not in light of all the facts that have They allowed me to listen to their recordings. Yes, and that they were the only two aircraft on the radar screen. According to the Air Force, Sergeant Frish lied to save himself. Yes. It was an F-Fifteen Eagle, according to an Air Force spokesman. I don't know what to believe. Those look like radiation burns. Where did you get that? You found it? What was it? Except it can't be proven. Because they haven't been able to find any physical evidence Mike Millar, the I.I.C.... the man running the investigation. I don't, except he seems to be the one man that truly wants He found Sharon Graffia wandering in a daze at the crash site That's another thing, Mulder. She's not Max Fenig's sister. She's an unemployed aeronautical engineer who spent time in-and-out I don't know. All I know is that this plane seems to be killing Shot in an attempt on Sergeant Frish on Washington. What are these people dying for? Is it for the truth or for I remember being amazed at what some people will call home. Only Max Fenig and you would appreciate living like this. Men with Spartan lives, simple in their creature comforts if What exactly are we looking for here, Mulder? What makes you think he was coming to see you? The military's public claim of fault for the collision and their That the story the military is now promoting is a convenient Look, I, I had the same reaction to the story as you, but there But not as a causal factor. Mulder, I don't know what else you expect him to do. Look, it is a good story, but it's, it's a house of cards built Well, where do we even start? She's a disturbed person, Mulder. She wasn't even who she claimed In a mental institution. Me too. Sharon? How are you feeling? I know. Yes, it does. If you know something, if you know anything about To Max. Why not? Max had those same blisters. You both were exposed to something, From whom? What was it? There was a third part. What happened to it? Mulder, it's me. Where are you? How did you find it? Mulder... I don't know. Mulder... Mulder, did you hear what I said? No, no, no, Mulder, listen to me. Do not handle it. Whatever Mulder? I think that what we've got here, Mulder, is a case of high-tech What flight number? I don't think that'll to be a problem, Mulder. Scully. Mulder, where are you? What? Mulder, did you get on that flight... Right. Yeah? What? Mulder? Mulder? Mulder. Where is he? What do you mean? You said you had him on this plane. You said I don't think you want to know the answer. Max would have wanted it that way. You lost somebody very close I realized I didn't even know his first name. I actually was thinking about, uh...    Yes.  Is the assessment team here?    Sir, se appreciate the pressure that you're under, but...    I'm afraid you can't do that.    You've got a dead man who's got over 1/3 of his body tissue completely    Simple?    No, it didn't, that's the thing.  Until we culture the tissue and run the proper    We were told you folks said that the tunnel was free of pathogens.       Deaths for which there may be many explanations    No.  You're going in without me.    I don't know what kinds of game are being played, but I'm going to be much    You've got capable people with you, Agent Doggett.  What I need down       Third rail's powering down.  You're clear to enter the subway       We got you every step of the way.       Agent Doggett, you still reading me down there?       What just happened?       Yeah. Ask Dr. Lyle if she can get a sample.       Yeah, I got it.  I'm getting a reading... Sample analysis is       Let me get on the phone.  Maybe I can get a molecular analysis.       Yeah.  It's a fork in the line.       It's about a mile up the main tunnel.       Agent Doggett.       Agent Doggett...       Agent Doggett, what happened?  Can you hear me?       What did?  Agent Doggett.        Uh, okay, I see it.  Um, I'm going to need some data.    Oh, my god.       Yeah, I see them.  Can you get any closer?       Can you get them uncovered?       I see signs of the same tissue degradation we saw in the other       Agent Doggett?       Agent Doggett...       Agent Doggett, if there's somebody else down there you're going    "Those people" just found three dead bodies and I want to know what    You don't understand.  They could be infected and contagious.       Then, who are those dead men and how did they die?    Then take a look at the man who fits the description of your killer, okay?    Just look at his injuries, sir.  He died the same way.  There is something       Yeah?       I want you to leave those bodies where you found them and go       We need to know whether he is causing this or if he's infected       Agent Doggett?       You all right down there?       You're about 50 yards from the spot where the train stopped.       I don't know.  Anything.        What is it?  What's happening?  Agent Doggett?!       Yeah, um, get some fresh water on it!       I don't know what to say... I, mean, i-it's something attacking the       I hate to say this, Agent Doggett but it looks like it could be       Agent Doggett, I pulled up a map of the subway grid where you    Dr. Lyle...  Dr. Lyle, how are you feeling?    Yeah.    Well, we got vehicles on the way.  The CDC doctors have been informed of    I'm working on that.    Hey!  What are you doing?!  Hey, where are you taking them?  Those bodies    These bodies need immediate examination and diagnosis.    By whom?  I already arranged it.       You knew those bodies were down there, didn't you?    Look at the way they're wrapped.  Somebody sealed them in plastic, hoping    I want to see inspection reports.  I want to know who was down there in that    Good.  Now, let's get these bodies to the CDC where they're supposed to go.       Agent Doggett?  Agent Doggett, can you...  Agent Doggett?    Excuse me?    No... Yes... I mean, I'm-I'm she.  Can I help you?    I'm sorry.  Yes, Dr. Bowe, please.  Um... Did you get an analysis?    Calcium?    So you're saying that this is a sea creature?    Which is why the    It's killing people.    I don't know.  There is seawater in that subway tunnel and it's eating    No. Something triggers it.    No, I have not.  But my partner is down there, and I fear the worst.       Agent Doggett?  Agent Doggett, can you hear me?  Agent       Oh, you had me.  I, uh... I started fearing the worst.       And what's your condition, Agent Doggett?       I'm going to send a quarantine unit down to get you, Agent    Dr. Bowe, I need you to get on the phone with the CDC.  Tell them    Look...  I need you to blockade any and every exit from the system.  You've    No, you listen to me.  Your lieutenant is infected and at large in the system       Agent Doggett...  We've got a new wrinkle.       We're running out of time.  It's 20 to 4
00.       Agent Doggett, you shouldn't be moving at all.       This organism that's on your skin-- something triggers it, and I       Yeah, I guess you're right.       He's got passengers waiting at the next station.    You see this, Dr. Bowe?    You see this, Mr. Karras?    You're on with the CDC?    I need anything they can give me about what sets this organism off-- an idea,       Get out of there, Agent Doggett.       I'm going to send a hazmat team down for him but from what       Yeah.       What's he pointing at?       Agent Doggett, turn the light away.    I think I just figured it out.  I might know what triggers this.       Sweat.  Perspiration is a conductor for calcium ions promoting a       That's right.  And since the boy's sweat glands aren't fully        Agent Doggett, where's he going?       Yeah. I'm...  I'm checking my graphic here.  It... It looks like he's       Yes, we do.       No. It's worse than that.  I think this moron Karras has started the       Agent Doggett what are you doing?  Agent Doggett...  Get off       Get out of there, Agent Doggett!       Agent Doggett?  Talk to me, Agent Doggett.       Agent Doggett, are you there?  Can you hear me?       Thank god.  Uh... I lost you on the visual.       Okay...  Okay, I've got you.  You're back.       Are you okay?    Where do you think you're going?    Well, you're not... Agent Doggett.  Your skin and body have been rid of the    Yes.    Well, the kid is with Social Services and plastic surgeons are working on    No.  It's over, Agent Doggett.       But there is no proof of that.    What I'm saying is that the organism is no longer extant.  It's destroyed.    I'm guessing by the electrical charge that you set off.    Infected by a pathogen of unknown aetiology.    Look, Agent Doggett, not a criminal charge is going to stick.  These guys    But they've got you to thank.  And not just for saving their butts.    Let's go home. I feel time like a heartbeat, the seconds pumping in my breast like I guess that's the question. Actually I feel fine.  It's what's called nasopharengeal mass. It's a small growth between A tumor. You're the only one I've called. No. The truth is that the type and placement of the tumor make it difficult, For all times I have said that to you I am as certain of this as Yes there are. Thank you sir. I don't mean for this to be awkward and I would appreciate No sir, actually I've asked my doctors to hold onto my medical records Yes sir, but for my own reasons I'd like to like to pursue this We're not here for the garage sale. We're looking for Betsy Higopian. Someone's sending a fax or computer modem. And downloading data. Apartment 234 is listed under Kurt Crawford.   Stop! Federal agent! Hold it! Put your hands What? I'm fine Mulder, quit staring at me I'm fine. Ya I'm just washing up. (cleaning blood off her nose, she leaves You took his cuffs off. Then why did he run? You think he's credible? Well, that will have to be cross-checked. Why not? (pause while Mulder and Scully look at eachother, S walks How did they die? All of them? What makes you think this is a conspiracy, that the government's About what? What am I denying? Mulder it doesn't matter.  I don't know what happened to me. I have no clear recollection No they are not. One woman isn't. There's Penny Northern.  About what? What it feels like to be dying of cancer? I'm..I'm sorry did someone tell you I was coming here to see you? Then how did you know it was me? I'm sorry I don't mean to be insensitive, but uh, I don't share I've come to ask you some questions. No. Who's Dr. Scanlon? His name's Scanlon? Mulder, it's me. I'm at the hospital with Penny Northern. Where are you? Mulder that's.. Mulder I need you to come up here. I need you to bring the overnight bag from the trunk of the car Mulder, whatever you found or whatever you might find I think that  Ya hi, sorry sleeping. Oh you know. I don, I don't feel sick at all. I know that the chemotherapy is going to make me sick. Hi mom. This is uh, this is Dr. Scanlon. Mom, I'm fine. I'm going to be fine, I'm just here for treatment Thank you.  Mom, I know what you're gonna say, but I don't I wanted to get all the answers first. I have found some clarity, and maybe a way to fight back. You'll know mom. I know mom.  Where am I? I feel nauseous. I had a bad dream. Some..someone was doing something bad to me. I'm sorry Penny. I ca..can't hear this right now. I have not written to you in the last 24 hours because the treatment No, I don't think so Penny. I haven't. I won't I didn't want you to read that. I had decided to throw it out. I Yes. That will have to be proven, if we find him. Mulder I can't kid myself. People live with cancer. They carry on,    I, uh... I rode up on the elevator with someone.    Yeah.    You met him?    What does he write?    These are, uh... these are my autopsy reports from the    As you can see the heart was removed in the same    No. There's no prints, no DNA material, no hair and fiber.    Mulder, psychic surgery is some man dipping his hand in    Well, medicine, as you're referring to it is about keeping    I don't know.  I have no idea.    Well, a crime is only as perfect as the man or the mind that      Scully.      Are you sure?      I'm not sure that I could.  Did anybody see anybody?      Well, there's got to be something, Mulder...      Something about his victims-- why he chooses      An envelope's been slipped under your door.      It's unmarked.      It's some kind of a pendant.  Like a charm.    It's called a "milagro."  That's the Spanish word for "miracle."    It was dropped off at reception by a man in his late 20s,    Did you see that it's a burning heart?    Well, maybe it has something to do with his next victim.    I think I'll check it out.    Thank you for making my schedule but I think I'm going    Why are you telling me this?    Yes.  How did you know that?    I know you.  You live next to somebody I work with.    You imagined it.    Yeah.    That was from you?    Yeah, and I don't know you now and I don't care to.    I'm sorry.    I was doing some research and learning that I owe you an apology.    The Milagro charm-- you were right about its insignificance.     Mulder, this... is nothing more than    Yes-- my secret admirer who claims to know the mysteries    No, I wish I were.  He cornered me today and told me my    No.  "Frightening" as in too much information and intimate detail.      No, but that shouldn't be too hard to find out,    Hi.  I, um... I was going next door and I thought that I'd    Because I can't return the gesture.    I can't.    You don't have any furniture.    You don't eat?    Writing your books?    Anything I'd know?    Why now, all of a sudden?    Well, you lead a curious life.       Loneliness is a choice.       My life's not so lonely,  Mister, um...    It's actually anything but.    How is it you think you know me so well, Mr. Padgett?    Right.     Since when?    And you moved into this building by coincidence?    You moved here because of me?      This is all about me?    May I read it?    You don't have anywhere to sit.      I'm due next door.    I'm very uncomfortable with this.    If you know me so well then why am I standing here when    Mulder!    What are you doing?      Yes.    Mulder... what are you doing?       Mulder.  Not without his lawyer.       Mulder.    Mulder, where are you going?       I did that.  That's what I've been doing.    He's dead.    Two years dead, Mulder.  I'm having them fax me a certificate    Well, maybe he didn't do it at all.    Maybe he imagined it, like he said.  Like Shakespeare or    Well, isn't that what you do, Mulder, as a behavioral profiler?       I read a chapter.  What does he say?       I think you know me better    What is it?       Grief squeezed at her eggshell heart       How could she know this pain would end?    She's a no-show at home or anywhere else she might go.    Maybe his statement's to prove that he's telling the truth--    Mulder, that's not him.    Mulder.    Mulder, he works here.    How did you know, Mulder, that the body was in the truck?    It's still no evidence that Padgett directed the killer.    Mulder, you are making critical assumptions without    What are you doing?    Mulder, why couldn't he have imagined it?      Mulder, of course not.    No. He's just sitting there.  Staring.    He just started typing again.       Yes, sir.       I'm sorry?    Mulder, have you been spreading rumours?    Not particularly.  So what do you have here?    Thank you.  Merry Christmas to you, too.       It looks like someone on the inside was trying to get out.       What about the person or persons who did the digging?       See, you had me up until there.    I think it's what you said before.   I think it's a grave robbery with       Publicity ... fear ... rumours ...  I mean, I don't know what    Special Agent Raymond Crouch, Age 56,  married, no children.     I read over the report and there's no indication otherwise.    Obviously, there are clear ritualistic elements to this crime.       Yes, somewhat.  They were former FBI agents who offered       How well do you know this man?       What's he doing here?    Single-minded.    Sounds like someone I know.    All four committed suicide in the last six months.  All were       Sir, we've been having a really difficult time gleaning any    Hey.    I've got the men concentrating on       Well, if you're going to tell me that he, uh, stopped by the side       Protecting himself against what?    More salt.   Losing your daughter.  You're in a custody battle with the parents    And so you retired.    And to that end, they committed suicide.    Could you tell us a little bit more about this man?    Rice County morgue.    Mulder, you're telling me it's more important to track down    Mulder, those people, even when they were alive mangled biblical    Anyway, I think that Frank's profile is sound.    And I think with it we have our best chance of finding this    And what are you going to do?    Hello?    Sir?    All things considered...?    The Sheriff's Deputy.   The man we found this morning.    Three rounds center-of-mass into his chest.  No effect.    Yeah, this man, uh, Mulder calls a "necromancer," our suspect,    No, he went looking for our suspect's home.  No one's been able    I'm not sure that I really understand your reasons, sir, and I'm    One of them attacked me.    Now, as crazy as this sounds, I have to ask.  Do you believe    But what if it were true?  Good and evil -- which would prevail?       Scully.       And?    Rice County?  That's where I am right now.    I'm going to need an address.    Mr. Black.    Mike Johnson's been taken for psychiatric evaluation.       And, um...       There's someone here to see you.    You're not going to stay and watch?       No, it didn't.       Happy New Year, Mulder. The deceased is Paco Ordonez aka Little Monster. The killer carved a single C-shaped cut up through the Her juvenile records are sealed, but Detective Pennock Ms. Glenn took a $60 cab ride Uh, Special Agent Scully. We’d like to ask you some questions, I’m curious why you’ve refused your right to an attorney. Well, you could be charged right now .. for the fact that  The cabbie has given a statement If you were involved in any way. Did you intend to buy drugs from Paco Ordonez? Did you kill him? She wouldn’t explain her presence in the crime scene, Detective, did you snake all of the plumbing in the bathroom? Well, if we find the weapon with her fingerprints on it,  Okay.  Scully.  About what?  How do you know that she knew  Would you like me to remind you why polygraphs  Well, maybe she was, Mulder, but don’t  Well, how else did she see? Bat  Detective Pennock. They were found at the crime scene with blood all over Your prints are already all over them, Marty. Hope you saw what just happened in there. I think it’s arrogance, Mulder. I think it’s the So, you think that it was pride that made her ditch the Okay, so - so by your reasoning, the killer took off with Well, wait a minute. Maybe it’s much simpler than What if she’s not really blind? I mean, she hasn’t No, no. But - but possibly it’s a - a conversion There’s no way that she could fool the machine? But she is still our best and only suspect. Want to hear the latest? Detective Pennock ran the gloves for blood typing and Yeah, well, all the same I’m going to hand deliver them I’ll let you know as soon as I get the tests back.  Mulder.  I’ve got the PCR results on the two blood She told you he’d be in there? What made her decide to cooperate? All of a sudden? I mean, if she’s so anxious to Well, yet, according to you, she’s been seeing through When the murders started. Well, if all this is true, let's go get him. (Starts How did you know he wouldn’t be in there? She’s still protecting him? What do you mean? Mulder... The woman on the table has a malignant tumor on her spine. It came in from the regional office in Tennessee. You've heard of him? Did you know that he also claims the boy brought a man Well, not according to the Kenwood Country sheriff. No, murder. Watch the tape. Twenty minutes later Lucy Kelly was rushed to the hospital. I don't know, but it wasn't cancer. They've requested  Mulder, you weren't at Woodstock. Maybe we should head backstage and see what the  Reverend Hartley? We're with the FBI. We just want to talk to Samuel for a couple of minutes, Right. Thank you. Well, there's nothing out of the ordinary about these Well, maybe we can arrange to have the bodies exhumed. We don't mean you any disrespect. We're investigating a We can't do much here, anyway. Some might call it a plain old bar brawl. The trouble of what? So you're saying that you killed those people with a touch? Did he buy you all that jewelry, too? I think there's No. But I doubt the veracity of your claims. Is this some kind of a trick?  I think we should get the sheriff ... Sheriff? How do you think he does it? Why, Mulder? A few thousand grasshoppers does not constitute a plague. So what's next? The slaying of the firstborn? (Mulder "Spontaneous remission of metastatic cancer ... Mulder, I admit this is intriguing, but there's a whole Um-hmm. So your theory is that if Samuel can repair this energy field OK, say that Samuel's touch can kill. Why would he You mean Sheriff Daniels? Well, he seems to think that your ministry is a fraud. In light of recent events, you can't blame him. I think so. Mulder, what do you think? Mulder. What is it? Who? Jessica Hahn? Apparently miracles don't come cheap. Mulder? I'm a doctor. Somebody get an ambulance!  She's dead. We know the Reverend Hartley's been pressuring you, What illness did your daughter suffer from, Mr. Hohman? And has she ever had a siezure before this? You see, I think that the siezure she had is indicative of And are you going to be content to bury her without knowing No. I was raised a Catholic, and I have a certain familiarity  One of my favorite movies. So who were you pursuing in the crowd tonight? That boy really has you going, doesn't he? In the bar, Samuel mentioned your sister. Is it your sister Maybe you just want to see her. Mulder, don't discount the power of suggestion. A healer's  11
21 pm, March 7. Subject's name is Mulder, take a look at this.  Lesions on the lungs here. My guess? Ingestion or injection of sodium or potassium Labs won't be open 'til morning. He was alone in his cell when Mulder left him this morning. Reverend Hartley. We're sorry for your loss. You've got that look on your face, Mulder. The kind when you've forgotten your keys and you're trying to What exactly are we trying to find? Oh. What does it mean? Well, where did they all come from? And you think whoever did this is responsible for the I'm afraid not, Reverend. We've traced a pesticide order to Cyanide - there's no way to tell how much he's ingested. It's too late, we have to get him to the hospital ourselves.  Rather than simply killing Samuel, Vance Sundays will probably never be the same again in these parts. Even without his son? Yeah, and I have a story about a plague of locusts. I just What exactly do you think? You coming, Mulder?      You're in charge here, you know.  It doesn't      Nooooooo!!!!    You didn't miss the meeting.  You're extraordinarily late for the    We took a short break and I came looking for you.  What are you    Since I've been working here? Yeah.  When did you get a waterbed,       When do I not?    Drop it!  Drop it now!    They're not going to call.  What's your name?    Look, I got to call you something, right?  How about Steve?  It's a      Bernard.  I have to get my partner out of here.    Oh... look, they don't know that.  Don't you realize that?  They    Look... just walk in front of the door and show them.       I just want everybody to live.  That's all.  I       Noooooo!!!!    Well, not yet, but, uh, only because it's the longest in FBI    Well, I came looking for you.  We took a five-minute break (looks    Yes. Frequently.  But, I mean, who's …  who's to say that if you    No, I think that we're free to be the people that we are-- good,    Since when did you get a waterbed?    Fate.    Then let's change yours.  I will deposit your check.  You gather   Drop it.    Bernard, she's not dead.  You're not a murderer yet.    Yes?    The bank?    Uh... I'm not following.  Did-did you get separated from your tour?    Um... I'm sorry...    Hey.    Huh? No.  No, we, uh, took a five-minute break about, uh, three    What?    Well, that's fairly common.    Well, you may have.  Did you do a lot of drinking in college?    Mulder, I don't see why it has to mean anything.    Set what kind of things right?    Mulder, it's more likely that we're talking about simple    What if you'd lived this moment before and now you're living it    Well, right now I'd say you're fated to go to this meeting.    Mulder... what bank?    Eighth Street.       Some ... some woman just stopped me in the hallway not    Five-eight, thin, green eyes, dyed hair.  M-maybe you know her.    You didn't miss the meeting.  You're extraordinarily late for the    Excuse me.      Mulder, where are you?      Yeah, I know where you are, but what's taking so long?    Ma'am, will you come with me?    Just come with me, please.    My partner said you'd know.    Drop it!    Drop it now!      This is Agent Dana Scully with the FBI…      Mulder, it's me.      No, not yet but Skinner wants to see us in his office      I'd like to hear it, too.      That's not what I mean.  You still won't explain what      And it was also a feeling that he had an accomplice      Are you okay? Mulder...  what are you doing to my poster?  Mulder, have you been taking your meds? We've been given another case, Mulder.   It has a monster in it. One witness claimed that the creature had three eyes and the other one, one. You want to talk to these witnesses while we're here? Anyway, this is the area where they say they saw the creature attacking the animal control officer, even though he claims to not have seen whatever it was that was attacking him. Well, that is what the local authorities thought, until they did a search the next morning and they found this area over here, where they found three more victims. Well, they were all mutilated in exactly the same manner. However, the third victim wasn't wearing any clothes. The uniqueness of the wounds, Mulder, implies a human element. Mulder, I can see that you're going through a questioning phase of some sort, but people have been killed here.  And if we can help stop that and save some lives, I think that is a...  unquestionably worthwhile thing for us to do, regardless of whether the thing we find is animal or human or  otherwise. It had a horn? Like a... unicorn? Boxers or briefs? Sorry.  Hey, aren't you the officer who was attacked the other night? So do you have any idea what kind of animal this woman might have seen this evening? What are you doing? Mulder... If this thing looks like those drawings, I'm emptying my clip into it.  Even if it is in its underwear.  Mulder... What is that? It's a fresh kill. MULDER! Mulder! You've got blood on you.  Did you get a good look at it? Sorry.  Mulder... But what is it? Maybe it was a mangy Sasquatch. Mulder, you've got the lens pointed the wrong way. I haven't done the blood analysis yet, but it's probably residue from the prior attack on this victim.  And - animals don't shoot blood out of their eyeballs. Mulder, the Internet is not good for you. What, so now you're saying that you were attacked by a six-foot horny toad? My initial exam of the bite marks on this wound would suggest that they were made by a human being. Yeah. Yeah.  I am.  I forgot how much fun these cases could be.  It's been a long day, Mulder.  Why don't you go back to the hotel and get some sleep?  And try not to dream about monsters. Yeah, this is how I like my Mulder. No!  You're batcrap crazy! What facts? Yeah, okay. Well, we need to talk to this guy. Well, that sounds like a good investigative plan. Mulder, it's me.  I can't believe I'm about to say what I'm about to say, but...  I think I just found your horny toad lizard man. Yeah. At the phone store by the motel.  I think he works here. But, Mulder, I just got an e-mail with the lab results, the blood tests from yesterday, and there are some discrepancies.   Mulder? I'm wondering if I can ask you some questions. I don't know. I came in and I asked him if I could ask him some questions, and he suddenly yelled "I quit" and he went on a rampage.  He fled out the back through the stockroom. He went that way , down the back alley.  But, Mulder, I got the results back from the lab, and... I'm wondering if I can ask you some questions.  I think maybe my phone isn't working right, 'cause guys don't send me pictures of their junk on it. I think maybe I'd like to... take a picture of yours. Come on. I want to make you say "cheese."  You're an animal! An animal!  Oh, don't stop! Don't... Hey, Mulder, where have you been? I take it you found your were-lizard? I don't see the difference. I'm at the animal shelter.  I'm waiting to see that animal control officer. No, I guess maybe he's like us. Some jobs keep pulling you back. Ow! Oh! This little puppy here just tried to take a bite out of me. He's a cute little guy, though.  Kind of reminds me of Queequeg. You know, there was a recent comparative cognition study that showed that dogs hold hostilities toward people that harm their masters? I mean, I guess maybe I miss having a dog to love...  ...and someone to hold my grudges for me. Hey. You missed all the fun. Yeah, but I hate to disappoint you.  It wasn't some monster running around, killing people and eating their flesh - it was a normal human being. Yeah. That one autopsy result showed that the actual cause of death was strangulation.   And so, on a hunch, I analyzed the pole that he left behind, and there was tissue and blood from previous victims. Okay, all right.  Leave it for the trial.  You're right, Mulder. You've seen one serial killer, you've seen them all. Thought maybe you'd want some more quality time with your lizard man.  Besides, you forget - I'm immortal. Mulder, how did you figure out it was him? Hey, buddy. You want to come home with me? Look at you, you're shaking. Okay, okay. Now tell us what you're so close to. Yes, I am. By reputation. Um, he's an Oxford educated Psychologist, who Agent Mulder. I'm Dana Scully, I've been assigned to work with Actually, I'm looking forward to working with you. I've heard Yes. I'm just heading into surgery. Who is it? A.D. Skinner's looking for you. He doesn't know how to reach you, Mulder. I barely know how myself. He wants to know if you've been watching someone called Tad O'Malley on the 'net. Apparently he's reached out to us from the FBI. I'm just the messenger, Mulder. Apparently this guy is desperate to meet. Seriously? Uber? I just worry about you, Mulder. It's good for you to get out of that little house every once in a while. I'm always happy to see you. Yes. That's... quite an entrance you make there. Aircraft employed by whom? I take it you have enemies. You'll have to excuse him. How can we help you, Mr. O'Malley? As are the X-Files. For better or worse, we've... moved on with our lives. Our expertise for what? That's quite an assertion, Mr. O'Malley. What's stopping you? Aliens couldn't find this place. How did you, Mr. O'Malley? How many times have you been abducted, Sveta? I'm familiar with the syndrome. Like what kind of things? The aliens made you pregnant? They removed your unborn fetuses? Have you had a doctor confirm that? I'm gonna take a swab. If you'll roll up your sleeve I'll get some blood, too. What makes you say that, Sveta? Is that a personal trait, or is that what happens with alien DNA? Would you care to demonstrate? So it just... happens whenever. I'm sorry, what? You reading my mind, Sveta? That's enough. Why don't you tell me. High cholesterol. The usual around here. It's a disease called microtia. Children born without ears. I assist the surgeons, who are really doing God's work. Giving kids what their biology neglected. Possibly, but not conclusively. It's most common in Navajo Indians. I assure you that is simply a random coincidence, Mr. O'Malley. Far, far from that experience. As a scientist, it was probably some of the most intense and challenging work I've ever done. I've never felt so alive. Possibly one of the most intense and challenging relationships I may ever have. And quite honestly, the most impossible. Are you here for a reason? No, it's fine. I'm... used to it. Mulder. Mulder, hold on a second. Can we pull over a second? I've got to get out. Mulder, what are you talking about? Can we talk about this soon? Couldn't you be jumping to conclusions? Mulder, where are you going? Mulder? Talk to me. Thank you.  Nurse? I need you to do something. I need these samples retested. I just want them retested, please. Thank you. Oh... and I'm expecting a call... well, I'm hoping for a call... from somebody named Mulder. Mulder, you hang up on me, I don't hear from you all day. You're on some jag about the X-Files...  I don't know what you mean. That's why I'm here, Mulder, as somebody who cares about you. As somebody who's worried about you.  No, you listen to me, Mulder. I have seen this before. You're on fire, believing that you're onto some truth, that you can save the world. It'll be your undoing, Mulder. You want to believe. You so badly want to believe. Tad O'Malley is a charming man full of charming B.S., Mulder. How do you know he's not playing you? He's a player. What are you talking about? Mulder... listen to me. As your friend, and as a physician, you are on dangerous ground here. You know what you're doing.  I just need to get out of here. Don't tell me what's important, please. I just need to leave. I shouldn't have come. Mulder, what are you up to? The takeover of America? Happening as we sit here? An alien invasion of the U.S.? You can't say these things. It's fearmongering claptrap, isolationist techno-paranoia so bogus and dangerous and stupid that it borders on treason.  Saying these things would be incredibly irresponsible. Your test came back negative. She has no evidence of alien DNA. You look exhausted, Mulder. I don't know if you saw, but... Tad O'Malley pulled the plug. And what about Sveta? Where is she? We need to find her, Mulder. We need to protect her, no matter what. I ran them again. In fact... I sequenced her entire genome because I didn't trust the initial results. And I sequenced my own genome... because of my history and... because we have a child together. I'm saying she's not the only one. I'm saying someone has to stop these sons of bitches.  Skinner. I don't know there's a choice. Why don’t I have a desk?  Back there. So what is it you want me to keep an eye on? And these reports are for sale? Mmmhmm. Have you confirmed the identity of these individuals? I’m not going. Your contact, while interesting in the context of science fiction, Rocky and Bullwinkle are looking for an upsidasium mine. "Refusing an assignment?" It makes it sound like you’re my superior. And it’s become mine. This isn’t about you. Or maybe it is, indirectly. Where will you be? Wow.  The, uh, the color ... the red on the lips. It’s extraordinary. Mm-hmm. Thank you. What, you didn’t get the tattoo you deserve? Never say never. Yeah, sometimes I wish I were that impulsive. I’m in town visiting my aunt in the neighborhood. How So it wasn’t so much "impulsive" as it was "hammered?" No. I’d like that. But um.... I’m ... um leaving Hello? Mulder. What’s wrong? How did you know where I was? I’ve handed it over to the Philadelphia bureau. Mulder, there is no Xfile. Your contact is connected to What do you mean, how do I know? You assigned me the background What, you don’t think I’m capable? It’s not just in this case, Mulder. It is over. Done. Pudovkin is out of our hands. I have everything under control. I will talk to you later. Uh, hi. Um, Ed Jerse, please. It’s Dana. We met today. Um, my, uh, my flight was I could pick you up. Good. Well uh, I’ll see you then. Hi. I’m, uh, early. The storm’s not so bad. Ed, I-I uh, I don’t go out very much. I think the last I’m a doctor. Do you want me to take a look at it? Ed.... the, uh... the crummy bar you told me about. Take So, what make this place a good place to go when you’re feeling Yeah, but you can’t tell what’s going on in somebody’s head Who knows? I mean sometimes, I, uh... I’ve always I want to see it.  I want to see it. It’s okay. Yeah, um.... it feels weird. I, uh, I can’t see it and.....  Ed, you’re bleeding again. Ed, it looks burned. Uh, I’m sorry. He’s not in. I don’t know where he No. Could I help you with something? I’m with the Such as? Look, I have a background in forensic medicine. May I?  Okay. Yeah, Fox Mulder, please. Ed. Sit down. (Moves her coat. Her badge is You need to tell that to the detectives. But what I’m We need to get help. Now, I’m going to go into the other Okay, let’s go.  This isn’t you, Ed. Get control of yourself. Take control!  Not everything is about you, Mulder. What are you watching? That's not your usual brand of entertainment. You spent money for this? Mulder, this is even hokier than the one they aired on the Fox Well, technically, I don't know why they would be wearing gas Olive oil? Snake oil? I suppose you think it's alien blood. I guess that begs the question, if this is an alien autopsy... Well, What do you want for twenty-nine ninety-five? And this is real because it doesn't? Who's selling these tapes? Front door's been boarded up. Mulder, in here. Either they can't locate an interpreter, or the interpreter Somehow, this is a tall request in Allentown this time of night. This is a surprise, sir. What do you mean? What about the murder victim or the paperwork? I don't know, Mulder, it just doesn't track. What would a Japanese Well, what do you want to do now, drop it? What are you doing? What are those? What would he be doing with a list of Mutual UFO Network members What are you going to do? Hi, Betsy Hagopian? Is there some way that I can get in touch with her? No, I think you must be mistaken. I'm, I'm afraid I'm not who you think I am. One what? There must be some kind of mistake, I, I work for the F.B.I., A man named Steven Zinnzser was murdered about two miles from Did you know him? But you understand, I'm, I'm not a member, I'm an F.B.I. agent. But at the door, you said that I was one of you. Why did you ask me that? But I've never met any of you. I, I've never seen any of you Taken? Uh, taken where? I don't know. What men? Yes, I'm... I'm sorry. I don't think I'm ready to discuss this. But why is it that I don't remember you? How do you know that you're not mistaking me for somebody else? What mark? I really have to go. Yes. To see Betsy Hagopian. Why are you all at her house, where What's wrong with her? And you think this is the result of her abduction experiences? What do you mean? Why is the door locked? Do you have any idea where I've been? I went to go see those MUFON members to find out about that I found out that she's dying along with a lot of other women Am I? I don't know, Mulder. They, they, they said that they What is this? I've seen this man before. No, I... I've seen him before. What are you doing with this? Yeah, but they were in full surgical dress, you couldn't tell Murdered for what? Well, murdered by whom? Our government? For what possible reason? Mulder, that is still a fantasy. Believing's the easy part, Mulder. I just need more than you, What am I looking at? Where did you get this? Do you know what it is? So you're saying that this is manmade? Any way of finding out who manufactures it? What are these chips used for? How? Yeah. Scully. Where are you? I thought you said that it was our government's railroad. What do you mean? Mulder... Mulder... No, that's not where I know him from at all. What are you doing here? No, why? How do you know? I don't know what you're talking about. Why should I trust you? You've lied to us before. Mulder, don't get on the train. Because they know where you are... Look, Mulder, it's just too dangerous. Let it go. Mulder, don't get on the train. My baby is normal. This is my baby! Please don't let them take it!  It's going to be okay ... What? What's the matter? Yeah, the phone's off the hook because of the baby.  Come in. I know. He's gone. He's just ... gone. I don't know how to find him.  It makes sense in its own way. That's all I can Let it go, John. Drop it. Please. Exactly right, and they are unstoppable, and they are inside the FBI. I don't want to hear this. Look, there is nothing to any of this.  My baby... my son... is fine. I'm going to ask you to leave. I'm going to ask you to leave and not come back here. Sleepy time, sweet William. See you in a couple of hours.  It's, er, Scully.  Is Agent Doggett there? Yeah. Yeah, something. Um, I think I might have been wrong, telling you to drop your investigation. What is it?  And? Who?  Well, his blood alcohol level was up 0.15. He was drunk, he Careful autopsy. That's not what I'm saying. Water. Asphyxiation produced by the inhalation of water>. There are contusions on the forehead and This is what I do, Agent Reyes. We can let our fears get the better of us. We can, uh, imagine things, make  There is something.  Right here on the ankle. Yeah, that's what they look like. I don't know how, or who. I need to get this body into refrigeration if you want to preserve it as evidence. Whatever he's evidence of ... Monica, I don't know what to say, but good luck. I gotta go. I gotta get home. Third floor they have a cooler for the teaching cadavers. We could temporarily put him up there. Who is she? What's going on here? I'm gonna go now. I've got a child at home. Who is she? My baby is fine. I've just put him down. What is it?  Something happened, with my baby. I can't explain it. It's er, it's unexplainable, it's, um, not normal. I need answers. I need to know. I can't just sit around wondering ... Mulder can't know. He can't be brought back into this. He can't be brought back into the FBI. It's just Hello? I'm listening Let's start with the water. And what should they be asking? Look, I've had my fair share of outrageous conspiracy theories okay, so cut the mystery crap and get Chloramine is just a substitute for chlorine, you can drink it and it's harmless. Who? And how? Alright then, why? By adding something to our water? What you're saying is absurd. Huh  How can we trust any of this? Or you? What you say you are ... Nothing, nothing more than a small deformity of the spine. Physically, she seems absolutely normal, What don't you believe Agent Doggett? I just examined her. Well for your sake, I hope so, but I hope not for mine. If this is true about this ship and this lab, there may be answers there I can't risk not knowing. Somebody's already there. Sees us Who is it? This can't be right. I think we found the Captain. They're manipulating ova.  Female eggs for transplantation. Look at these names. These are test subjects. Just give me a second. No let go, let me do this. I have to see if I'm here. My name, my baby's name -  Everything's going to be okay. Go back to sleep. Not Fox, Mulder. Mulder, I don’t remember anything... after Duane Barry... I knew there was a reason to live. Mulder?  Thanks. Hmm. Could I see Nurse Owens? I’ve got something I’d like her Owens. Short with straight light brown hair? She watched over    Mulder?!    Quarantine for what?    Are we going to be able to talk to somebody who can tell us what    I think, based on our travel time probably Fort Marlene.  High risk    Based on what information?    What?    Where's Cassandra?    Cassandra Spender was in a general hospital environment for days.    Your isolation of Cassandra.    No one is sick or infected here.  I mean, I assume that based on    Mulder, I want to see Cassandra.    Yes, and I am a medical doctor.    They've burned our clothes.    Mulder, this stinks, and not just because I think that woman is    Agent Spender calling the Centers for Disease Control?  Mulder,    But she wasn't sick, Mulder.  I mean, the remarkable thing is she    Because of everything that had been done to her-because of the    What is she?    I'll ask you to hear me out before you launch any objection.    Mulder, she's playing you for a fool.    You knew her.  You don't anymore.  I think we can prove that to    Yet there isn't a single piece of information available on her    Travel records pulled from airline manifests that had been purged    Special Agent Diana Fowley of the FBI was visiting every European    Or hiding it.    Mulder, when I was abducted a chip was put in my neck.  When I    You tell me that Cassandra Spender is the critical test subject -    Well, then I can't help you anymore.    Because it is personal, Mulder.  Because without the FBI personal      Mulder, I was just dialing you.  Where are you?      I'm coming to get you.      No, Mulder, listen to me.  I'm going to take you to      I know, but I know where she's gone to, Mulder.      Mulder, I'm going there whether you're coming or not.      To the Potomac yards.  They're transporting her by      Agent Spender called me.    Sir, I wouldn't bet against him.      I promise you there is nothing    A man escaped from prison.    Isn't that why we're here?    Mulder, this case doesn't bother me.    Mulder, that man does things to people that no one should ever    6
06?  And what's so supernatural about that?    Have they been apprehended?    You mean, did I see him raise his foot?  Yes, I saw that.      I know what hypnosis is, Mulder.    If you're suggesting that Donnie Pfaster escaped from prison using    So, how would Donnie have acquired this amazing ability?    Well, then, who?    That song-- can you hear that?    I haven't heard that song since high school.  That's the second    Did you see him?    Excuse me, uh, could you turn that up, please?       Yeah.    You're lucky to be alive, Reverend Orison.    Special Agent Dana Scully.       That's nice... But my partner and I are more    What do you mean?  Reverend?    This has nothing to do with me, sir.    It's not exactly a long shot, sir.    What happened to the inmates, sir?    Where are you going, Mulder?    How do you prove that somebody isn't being directed by God?    I don't believe that.    Donnie Pfaster isn't dead, and we don't know that the other    No, but I believe that the Reverend believes what he's saying--      I'm trying not to take offense.    Mulder, I have heard that song three times now.  That may not    I never thought about it before.  It never meant anything to me       When I was thirteen my father was stationed in    He had been murdered in his front yard...  And that's the first    Swelling of the brain-- a trauma not uncommon with this kind    And he did this himself?    "Its powers."    So this hole in his head enables Reverend Orison to help these    Well, nobody can stop the world, Mulder.  I don't care how many    But why?  I mean, even if he could, why?    Well, then, if Reverend Orison meant to kill Donnie Pfaster then    Where did he go?    The prisoner... the man you were guarding in this room.    You didn't see him?    What does this mean?    No, I only told you.    I didn't mention the name of the song.    No, I'm sure I didn't, Mulder.    And for that I owe you an apology, Mulder.    Well, you were right.  I was looking too hard for connections    You know, Donnie Pfaster placed the call to the police that led    Go back to hell!       Let me go!  The only reason    I'm a federal agent.  You do anything to me and they will not    Yeah.       Maybe I don't have to.    But the law doesn't.    He was evil, Mulder.  I'm sure about that, without a doubt.    Who was at work in me.  Or what...  what made me...    I mean...  what if it wasn't? Mulder. We were delayed in DC. I tried you on your cell phone. Your message said something about a kidnapping? Is she here? What are we doing here? Incoherent speech. Well, that’s spooky. Are you feeling any better? Does that mean anything to you? Can you think of any reason why you might have said it? I’m sure as soon as your doctors feel it’s okay for you to go.  I guess she’s not too big on confined spaces. Mulder… I got something – something weird. I was going over Lucy Householder’s medical work-up and Forensics lifted two blood types off of her work clothes -- I don’t know, Mulder, but it begs the question. We’re not talking about the local population. We’re Well, we’ll know soon enough. I’m running a PCR on her blood to see if there’s a DNA Why? Mulder, I’ve got a ---- Is that Lucy? Well, by most yardsticks, she hasn’t, Mulder. School pictures were mailed out this week to everyone It’s an outfit called Larken Scholastic. Now, the DMVs, and old address, but he spent the good part of They’re doing it right now. Mulder, the blood on Lucy’s uniform was an exact DNA match. Mulder, it’s incontrovertible evidence.  I hate to say this, Mulder, but  You are protecting her beyond the point of reason. Did you consider for one minute that the person she’s For the same twisted reason that abused children crave It makes a lot more sense than the notion that she’s Mulder, you can’t ---- Then why did she run? If she’s innocent, what was You don’t see what you’re doing, do you, Mulder? The extreme rationalization that’s going on. Your But we already stick out like a sore thumb, Mulder. Yeah.  Mulder! What’s happening? Did you find her?  It’s all right.  What? But the river’s east and they found Wade’s car a mile north. Did she tell you that? Mulder, wait!  Stay with her and get word to One … two… three…. four…. One … two… three…. four…. …two… three…. four…five. There’s nothing. Mulder, it’s no good. I’m sorry. Mulder, stop. You can’t help her. Mulder. It’s no use. Mulder. She’s breathing. Yeah, we got her. We have to get an EMS unit here right It’s getting dark. We have to get her off the river. She’s exhausted, but it looks like she’s going to be fine. Wade must have left her alone. There were no injuries. I know, Mulder. I can’t explain it. She didn’t have a cut Yes. They, uh … they brought in the State Pathologist They found five liters of water in her lungs. Mulder … Whatever there What do you mean? Come on, Mulder, don't you see what they're doing? I'm not questioning the case's legitimacy, just their motives Yes, I read that report. She claims that she saw some kind  Those are only legends, This could have been made by anything-- a bonfire. I didn’t think anything gave you nightmares. What's this, Mulder? Well, Sheriff Arens, a man is missing. How do you mean? Did he have many chances? Is that what his wife thinks happened? So you're fairly certain that he left you for somebody else. Do you have any idea who he might be with now? Did your husband ever receive any threatening phone calls Well, there’s a possibility that his disappearance may Well he cited multiple violations. Was there any merit to his claims? So he really did threaten to shut the plant down. Problem enough to do something about? What are you talking about? Yeah, I read about that. It's caused by high-speed What happened to his lawsuit? So, Mulder, are you ready to admit they sent us on a  Well, whether George Kearns skipped town  You okay? Do you have any idea what might have prompted her attack? No recent complaints or strange behavior? Were you able to determine the cause? You didn't find anything physically wrong with her? Could it have been line hypnosis? How did you treat them? Well, I think an autopsy on Paula Gray would clarify things. Why? You're a physician. We’re sorry to disturb you, sir. We realize this is a difficult That's what we're hoping a postmortem will determine. I assume you’re talking about George Kearns. Then you're aware of his recommendation to close down I think we’ve got something here, Mulder. Take a look at this. It's a specimen from Paula Gray's brain. She suffered from Short of an autopsy it's very difficult to diagnose. Outside Absolutely. Victims of Creutzfeldt-Jacob suffer from This girl would have been dead in months. There’s got to be some kind of a mistake. The odds that Paula Gray and George Kearns had the Mulder, look out!  This is Federal Agent Scully. I’d like to report I just got off the phone with Dr. Randolph. He said this Well, they would be.  I just came up with a sick You saw the feed grinders at the plant. What if somebody It's possible. You know, sometimes in England they'll Mulder …. Well, so far I’ve been able to isolate nine distinct The pin in his femur. According to his medical file, Well. I'll need more sophisticated equipment to be certain, Well, besides that. The older bones show signs of decay It could be from erosion from the water, but... Any theories? Then it may have been the work of some kind of a cult. You think these people were eaten? Well, then Paula Gray may have contracted Creutzfeldt-Jacob What are you talking about? Cannibalism is one thing but increasing longevity by eating We never confirmed the date of birth on her personnel file. Smells like a recent fire. You think someone was expecting us? Where are you going? Mrs. Kearns?! Mrs. Kearns?! Mrs. Kearns?  Scully.  Yeah, Mrs. Kearns is missing too, Mulder. Mm-Mm.  Pending further review, the Chaco processing You're lying. No way. I said no! You're setting me up! Then put your weapon down and sit down. You said you weren't here to kill me, Skinner, now prove it. Damn it, Skinner! Yeah. I was warned that somebody would kill me... someone I trusted. Give me the tape. Where? Mulder, I am... I went to your father's funeral. I told your mother that you I just knew. Do you recognize any of these men? What did he do? What would he be doing in a photo with your father? Whatever happened to Klemper? What, what is it? I have to go there, Mulder. That bullet was meant for me. Those bastards... Because it escaped you or because you escaped it? History may be the only justice you'll ever know. As a Nazi or for the blood money we paid you? For a lot of innocent Jews. Yes, why? What do you think your father would have been doing here? Mulder, take a look at this. It's not working here either. Positive. Napier's constant is the basis of all natural logarithms. Mulder... You weren't even able to go to your father's funeral and if Mulder, look at this. Of medical files, by the look of it. Got names... alphabetized. Lots and lots of files. Standard medical forms. These are birth certificates, small It's an old tissue collection cassette, the new ones are plastic. Yes, exactly. 1955. All of these files are 1955. 1964, why? You're looking for a file on me? What? That's your sister's file. What are you looking for? I don't understand. Mulder, where are you going? Mulder! Mulder, I'm down here! I heard gunshots. What happened to you? I think there's a way out, down here. What kind of deal? An extremely elaborate filing system of medical records. I think we should let him make the deal, Mulder. Then what good are those answers to anybody but you, Mulder? Look, I want exactly what you want. But I need to see my sister. I told Skinner to make the deal. But not to hand over the tape I just need to know if she's going to be okay. Where's Victor Klemper? Operation Paper Clip. Mengele thought that he could produce a super-race through genetic Like Victor Klemper? Mulder, wait. The technology wasn't there, Mulder. DNA wasn't even identified Mulder, this man is telling you everything that you want to Like you said before, to protect yourself and the continuation I don't know. Yes, but records of what, Mulder? It happened three hours ago. She went into surgery and, uh... You were right. There is no justice. Then what is it about? I need something to put my back up against. I've heard the truth, Mulder. Now what I want are the answers. Mulder... You called for a forensic excavation at five A.M. on a Sunday? Mulder, what are you doing out here? You're saying that you're out here because of something you So, tell me about this dream. Mulder, if you destroy evidence, we may never find out what You're saying you got all these details from your dream? Whose M.O.? Did you? But it was your profile that caught him. Well, if nothing else... I think I can at least help explain You said it yourself once. You said that a... a dream is an I believe her name is Addie Sparks. She went missing from her The match is right, Mulder. The, the, the height is right, the Mulder, we're going to have to verify this. Are you up for that? Frank Sparks? Yes, I'm Agent Scully, this is Agent Mulder. We're with the Where is your wife, sir? No, sir, not full-time. What are you saying that means? Maybe... you're saying the hearts might still be in his car? Don't you think the car might have been searched at least once Thank you. Maybe it's underneath. Addie Sparks. We also found your cloth hearts. All sixteen of them. You're in here for life, you've got nothing to lose. I did. In your dream, Mulder. It was a dream. Your mind made it up. Is it a state secret you lived in Martha's Vineyard? Through the prison library. The inmates have access to computers The server records don't show, but on the Net, Mulder, he can What are you saying you believe now? It is looking possible, sir. John Lee Roche apparently spent Sir, the fact remains that we still have two more victims that Prove it. Mulder... let's get a team out here. Let somebody else do this. Mulder? You're right, Mulder, it's not a match. Tell us the name of that girl. What year? Drop the mind games. Oh, God... Agent Mulder convinced the judge that it was an emergency situation. I had left Agent Mulder for the day. I suggested that he get Martha's Vineyard. And I would hope that you'd appreciate the Mulder? He also took your badge and your phone. Where? What child? Mulder, what child? You don't think he took Samantha? Well, where do you think he'd take this girl? Would he follow Well, how much of a creature of habit is he? Do you think he'd Well, he lived in Boston in the early '70s, right? Roche's old address in the area. Revere. Nine-eight-o-nine Alice I don't think he brought her here. Come here. I got back some lab results. The dye analysis determined that I don't know... but I do know you.   Good morning.    I'm not here to be a curiosity, Agent Doggett.   I'm here to work.    Well... do you have any questions?    This is my partner's office, Agent Doggett. You and I will just be using it for    Homicides
 Two … in Idaho. White male, 62, undertaker by profession, he    Cause of death was blood loss from numerous deep wounds … from bites.    On his head torso and hands. Two of his fingers are missing... eaten off.    These were murders. The, uh, bites on his wife appear to be human.    Not according to local P.D.    Well, that's a good place to start.    Yeah.    Hi. Agent Scully. This is Agent Doggett.    Understand, Detective, that we've seen cases like yours regularly on our    I can assure you that there's nothing baffling about human bite marks.    It's not quite animal, either.    That's not an unheard of birth defect. Uh, no more rare than polydactylism.    I say that assumption is the problem here. A strange print is found and    I'm not quite sure yet.       I think that post-mortem predation is definitely a    You agree, Agent Doggett?    I'm sure your explanation will mollify all those hotshots down at the county    It could be but I'm not sure if it tells us anything.    Well, if anything, I'd say this print leads up the stairs.    Mm-hmm.    Yeah. You take every possible explanation and you choose the simplest one.    Unless you have a simple explanation as to how a killer with a deformed    Or to what he'd even be doing up here.       Agent Doggett.    Dark up here.    Right now, not a heck of a lot.    If there was anything up here it might have gone out that window.       Never.    What?    Well, from their smell, I'd say they were regurgitated.  Recently.    I saw those on the porch, too.    Hanging there?    Yeah. Well, I was waiting for some lab results and then I wanted to take    Nothing that will allay anyone's fears about what killed this man or his wife.    Well, to be honest, what I found here leans more towards an animal    Yeah.   I can't exactly explain it but I realize that I owe the Detective an        "The creature was taken to the county coroner who confirmed it    Did they ever find it?    Agent Doggett...    I found something. A photo album.   I think it's our first break on this case.    The victim's daughter-- Ariel-- her dead body was pulled from the river here    Well, you not only told her mother that her 62-year-old daughter was dead    The daughter is the connection.    I don't know exactly but these killings only started up since her burned body    Well, I suggest that you jump at it, too because her body may have been    What did you say to him?    What else did you say to him?    Look, I am not an expert. I am a scientist who happens to have seen a lot.  I    Look, so, so, what, you told him to exhume the body when you don't even    Well, I'd say that you're taking a pretty big leap believing in that article...    What happened to the lynch mob?    I heard enough.    I don't think so, Agent Doggett.    It was unavoidable.    This is the body pulled from the river. She died of natural causes--    Well, obviously to cover something up.    That's what I still don't know.    Look, it kills like an animal, but with purpose. It stalked the detective for the    The, uh, man who found her in the river.    A, uh, Myron    Yeah.    There's an address in his file. I hope we're not too late.    Myron Stefaniuk?       Good.  Sorry. You gave us a bit of a scare. We went to your    Well, we're investigating some murders, sir, that we believe may be    It may just be your connection to the body.    Well, sorry, sir, but that may be enough.    You know, we've been out here for nine hours. The only thing this man       Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe this is all just a... a grand    Yeah, I was sure of the facts as I had deduced them scientifically. Maybe    Maybe I'm just trying too hard.    What makes you say that?    Well, what does he have to hide?    Stop right there!    I see him.    Stop where you are!  Put your hands up and out! Now, turn around, slowly.    Even if that were true, sir, how could it possibly find you out here on an    Mr. Stefaniuk... it's killed four people. All of whom would have had traces    He's all right. We spoke with him earlier today.    What's that?    We followed your brother.    I was sure that what we were looking for was something other than a man.    I think he does now.    Well, I … I made the connections but it was Agent Doggett that got us out    Excuse me?    Sir, I'm here to protect you.    Well, this thing, Mr. Stefaniuk is … uh … still flesh and blood. It can be    What is that?    You hear it?    Maybe I got it. Maybe I killed it.    If you've got a gun, get it.    Yeah. I'm okay. But you're not, Agent Doggett. I got you.    He's alive? Where is he?    Do you believe it, Agent Doggett?    That this thing is still out there and someday it's going to come after us?    Yeah. You'll get used to it.    I, uh... I never had a desk in here, Agent Doggett but I'll see that you get one.    And I just want to say, um... thank you for watching my back. Is there something I can help you with, Agent Spender? About what? You're going to tell me who this is? Your mother? Is this part of a case? Then why is he talking to her? I think I understand. Shouldn't that be my picture next to the headline? Or is that just you having a little fun? You look constipated, actually. This wouldn't have anything to do with Cassandra Spender? How's that? Well ... I guess I'm done here. You seem to have invalidated your Her son accosted me in the hallway. He's an FBI agent. He's of the same opinion as you, by the way - that she's not well. You've come a long way, Mulder. Cassandra Spender was abducted at Skyland Mountain. That's where It says here that she has an implant ... in the base of her neck. Oh, no, he, uh, he asked if you'd please not talk about this with Cassandra? Miss Spender? I don't think so. Uh, yes, but not a practising one. My name is Dana Scully and, uh, I'd like to ask you some questions. May I? Um ... I think you should know that I, uh ... I learned Yes. I'm an FBI agent and he asked that I protect against your I guess I'm betraying that by coming here. But, um ... but I - I That's not why I'm here. I'm here because I, uh ... because ... I wanted to tell you that No. Not as of this moment. They've all been burned and there are plenty more who are still Well, it appears they all came by car. Most of the dead are There's no evidence of that right now. There's no accelerants, There's no way to ID their bodies right now. It's going to be a Well, you can't deny the connection. No ... I'm not saying that. What do you mean by evidence? Well, are you going to give me your theory, then? Cassandra? You called us? Friends from where? Your mother called us about the incident in Virginia. She said She was in a cult? For what? "Major depressive disorder characterized by periods of sustained By whom? Mulder, that doesn't make sense. But they weren't abducted. They were led to their deaths. Now, Mulder ... Maybe you shouldn't be so quick to rule out what Cassandra    Hi.    I'm sorry, Agent Doggett, I didn't realize that you had an appointment.    I'm sorry.  I don't remember.    That was before my time here.  But, uh, is there something I can help you    I-I thought you said that your wife was murdered.    Ooo-kay, Mr. Haskell.  Why don't you, uh, start from the beginning.    I don't suppose that you have any, uh, medical proof of this.    What doctors?    So you're... saying that it was the doctors that killed your wife?    Do you, uh... have all the information and numbers and a way that we can    Uh, we'll be in touch.    Thank you, Agent Doggett.  I'm sure the rest of my afternoon can't possibly    Interesting?  As in preposterous and outrageous?    What exactly are you getting at?    Well, I appreciate your thoroughness, Agent Doggett, and your familiarity    Hi.  Um, I'm sorry.  I had a doctor's appointment and, um, I don't know, I    Nothing.  No, I just, uh...  I went for a walk.    I'm... I'm sorry I haven't told you.  I don't know why I haven't.  I mean, you    I was left unable to conceive with whatever test that they did on me.  And I    What?    What?    You found them?    I don't believe this.    Is that what it was?  It was bad news?    I want a second opinion.    Um, I don't know.  I guess I just forgot to push the button.    There's nothing to do.    Hello.  Is anybody here?    I'm, um, I'm here with my friend.    Yes.  I'm worried about her.       Yes, I want to speak to Dr. Parenti, please.       Yes, it is.  It's Dana Scully.       I'm afraid.       I want you to look at something for me.  Right away.  It's an       I want you to compare it to mine.       Yes.  Fine, I'm... I'm okay.       Thank you.    Oh...  It's too good to be true.    We can start right away?    Yeah... I, uh... I just have to figure out how to ask him.    What did you find?    You didn't see anything strange?    I just want to be sure.  I've had... complications.    Okay.  Thank you.    Right.    Dr. Parenti is my doctor.    You don't believe me?    Excuse me, Agent Doggett, but are you investigating me?    No, I didn't ask you to drop the case.  I said there was nothing to do.    You are jumping to conclusions.    I am not investigating these people, Agent Doggett.  Parenti is my doctor.  Is    Hi.    Come on in.    Can I take your coat?    Obviously you've had some time to think about my request.    Okay, if... if you're trying to politely say "no," it's okay.  I, I understand.    Yeah.  I know... I, I understand.  I do.    Um... Well, I'll call Dr. Parenti and...    I assume that he'll want to meet you and go through the, uh, the donor    Yes.    No.    I can't.    Agent Doggett?    I want you to understand.    I told you... I'm not doing anything behind your back.    If I was putting you at risk in any way you can be sure that I wouldn't let you    I gotta go.    Yes, Dana Scully.  This is Ms. Hendershot.  Mary Hendershot.    Ms. Hendershot believes that she is carrying a baby that is not her own.    She believes, and with possible good reason, that her life may be in danger.    You should know that I'm not just here as an FBI agent.    That's why we've come to you.    A man named Haskell led her to me.  His pregnant wife is now dead.    Dr. Miryum...  she's not the only woman whose life is in danger.    Probably somewhere between four and 12 hours.    You mean getting pregnant?    Yeah.    Yeah.    Are you sure?    I just want to be certain that it's okay.    Yeah. I just want to know.  I'm anxious about the results.    Ms. Hendershot...  you have to get up.    I have to get you out of here.    Can you do this?    Who are you?    This woman could give birth at any minute. I hope you realize that.    Where are you taking us?    Oh.    Yeah, I just... just had a procedure.  I shouldn't even be on my feet.    Mrs. Hendershot?    We have to stop this car.    If you don't stop this car you could be endangering her life.    What are you doing?    I'm fine.  Let go of me.    Who are you?    Ms. Hendershot...    Mary!    No!    Hey!    Agent Doggett?    What are you doing here?  What am I doing back in this place?    What happened to me?    What about Ms. Hendershot?    What about her baby?    Oh, my god.  They switched it.  Agent Doggett, they switched it on her.    No, it's not.  We can prove this.    They showed me a tape of another woman's womb.    Well, then who were those men?    It was all planned.  You know that.  From the moment that man walked into    I was afraid.  Afraid that they'd use it against me to take me off the X-Files    I guess it was too much to hope for.    It was my last chance. Agent Dana Scully. Yes, sir. Well, sir, I was recruited out of medical school. Um, my parents Yes, I am. By reputation. He's an Oxford educated Psychologist, who wrote I believe they have to do with unexplained phenomena. Am I to understand that you want me to debunk the X-Files project, Agent Mulder. I'm Dana Scully, I've been assigned to work with Actually, I'm looking forward to working with you. I've heard If you have any doubt about my qualifications or credentials, Did you bother to read it? Needle punctures, maybe. An animal bite. Electrocution of some It's organic. I don't know, is it some kind of synthetic protein? Do you have a theory? Logically, I would have to say "no." The girl obviously died of something. If it was natural causes, You didn't mention yesterday, this case has already been investigated. And you found something they didn't. The autopsy reports of the first three victims, show no unidentified Better than you expected or better that you hoped? Is the medical examiner a suspect? I don't know. I've never had the pleasure. Hi. Hello. We're not insinuating anything, sir. Ray Soames was the third victim. After graduating high school, Exposure. His body was found in the woods after escaping the Subject is a hundred and fifty-six centimeters in length, weighing It's mammalian. My guess is it's a chimpanzee or something from You're serious? You don't honestly believe this is some kind of an extraterrestrial? Who is it? Pass. No... Were any of those Ray Soames' classmates? Are you treating any of these kids now? They're here at this hospital? Would it be possible for us to talk to them? How did it happen? How did you know that girl was going to have the marks? Damn it, Mulder, cut the crap. What is going on here? What do I'm here to solve this case, Mulder, I want the truth. By who? You don't really believe that? I'll buy that girl is suffering some kind of pronounced psychosis. There has got to be an explaination. You've got four victims. Mulder? We are conducting an investigation. Maybe it has something to do with this. It was all over the ground. I think something is going on out What are you looking for? We lost what? Come on. No, what a minute. You're saying that, that time disappeared. Great. I want you to look at something. What are they? Are you sure? Yes. I need to sit down. You never found her. What did you do? By accident? What? Who? I don't understand. And they're afraid of what? That, that you'll leak this information? I'm not a part of any agenda. You've got to trust me. I'm here But how do you know... The girl in the wheelchair? We need to ask you a few quest... What? They stole the corpse? There goes my computer. Theresa, your father knows about this, doesn't he? About what No, you're not going to die. They know Mulder. They know who's responsible for the murders. Dr. Nemman's been hiding medical evidence from the beginning. I don't know, I... What is going on here? Who? The detective? The boy in the hospital? The vegetable?! Billy Miles, a boy This fits a profile? Peggy O'Dell's watch stopped a couple of minutes after nine. And the force summoned Theresa Nemman's body into the woods Where are we going? Mulder, take a look at this. That kid may have killed Peggy O'Dell, I don't believe this. It's crazy! He was in the woods. This is the same stuff that I took a handful of in the forest. We lost the original sample in the fire. What else could it You said it yourself. You're right. We'll take another sample from the forest... and The detective's here. What do you think? Mulder, what happened? There was a light. Yes, sir. My reports are personal and subjective. I don't think I can't substantiate it, no. There were, of course, crimes committed. This is the object described by Billy Miles as a communication Agent Mulder believes we are not alone. Hello? Y, yes. Tomorrow. And it concerns me? I see. You know, it's strange. Men can blow up buildings, and they If I may say so sir, it has everything to do with interest. Sorry I'm late. No. It's nothing. What did you want to talk to me about? Why is that of interest? Longitude uh.. 171 east, latitude 42 north. Mulder... So what? Why don't you just ask them? From exposure to what? Could it have anything to do with their resumption in nuclear I'm just constantly amazed by you.. you're working down here You're in the basement because they're afraid of you, of your Well, maybe not a shovel. Maybe a backhoe. These symptoms, would you characterize then as acute or somatic? What kind of exposure are we talking about here? That's verging on the levels of victims of Hiroshima suffered. Did you get the chance to talk to any of them? Nothing? Yeah, thanks. Is this the way you found this room? It feels like somebody was looking for something, any idea what? What for? It's a North American P-51 Mustang. It's the shape of the canopy. I used to watch my father and No it was just a fighter. I don't know, but I might know somebody I can ask. Hi, I'm here to see Commander Johansen. Special agent Dana Scully, FBI.  No, uh.. he used to be a friend of my father's. I'm out here I know my way, thanks. Commander Johansen? I'm Dana Scully, I used to live 3 doors down. My father was Actually sir, I came to see you. I work for the FBI now and Thank you. No thank you. I know that you were an officer in the Pacific Yes, a P-51 Mustang at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean (Scully There was an illustration on the fuselage with the words "Drop Would the words Zeus Faber mean anything to you? Well would you know anybody I might be able to talk to? Somebody I wish you could too.  There's a number of French sailors I wish I could, he's passed away. I have to say this place brings back memories for me. I remember Why? What's this about? What's going on? I'm sorry...there's something else, isn't there? I don't know if I understand. You know something about that plane don't you? Mulder, it's me, where are you? Miramar Airbase. I think I've just found out what those men That P-51 Mustang was part of an escort for a B-20 carrying Says one of the men originally sent to find it, on a submarine It all makes sense Mulder, why would they build a nuclear weapon I don't know. What about you? Hong Kong? Radiation killed all those men? What happened to Sanford and the sick crew men? Scully. Yes. When? I'm on my way. "Dear Special Agent Mulder
 I’m writing to you for Uh, Mrs. Berkowitz? You said that you also had a And Izzy is the product of your union with some kind of Did you report this to the police? Was there an investigation? And now you’re pregnant again? You were gone for three days, but nobody missed you? Do you drink, Mrs. Berkowitz? Is there no chance that your son could have put it there? Mrs. Berkowitz? You gave a description of Funny. Sounds just like this. (MULDER comes We were wondering how this suspect in your mother’s case You’ve seen the Great Mutato? Has it crossed neither of your minds that what you say you saw  Peanut butter sandwiches? Why are you humoring them, Mulder? So is perjury. So is calling out FBI agents under Isn’t it obvious?  Psychologists often speak of the denial of an unthinkable But common sense alone will tell you that these legends, Is there anything that you don’t believe in, Mulder? What’s that sound? Where’d it go? We were just chasing what they told us was a monster. What achievements are those? Well, I’m a scientist, for one.  I, uh … I believe it has something Sir, unless you want your scientific achievements to end …. Growing out of his mouth. Despite what you might think, Mulder, designer mutations Mulder, even if they could, no scientist would even dare To unlock the mysteries of genetics, to understand how We already have that ability, Mulder. It’s called We’ve been had. I’ll save you the trouble of reading We have reason to believe that you or one of your friends In order to promote you comic book monster that you created.  … in the form of a hideous monster given  … What we can’t possibly imagine… Who the hell is that? Where are we going now? Mulder, this is just a dopey hoax. And you think that Dr. Pollidori has something to do with Mulder, I’m alarmed that you would reduce this man to I have to admit, Mulder. Everything looks What are you doing? Yeah. So?  Come on … Get up! Move! Mulder? Sir, with all due respect I think that this is all A shameless publicity stunt. Mulder …. You may have been right. That these people I may have found something that says otherwise. Farmers … who have to register with the FDA even to have Mm - hmm.  Mulder. If you’re armed, drop your weapon and walk out slowly! By whom? What makes you think he’s here? There’s only one way Pollidori could have seen that monster Mulder. Federal agents, and we’re armed! Come on out! Oh... Oh, my God. We’re not going to hurt you.  Do He looks frightened. We should go, Mulder. The prisoner’s in the What do you mean? There’s not going to be any bride, Mulder. Not in It appears to be a craft covered in symbols, which I now understand Agent Scully. He's expecting me. "They"? Sorry to keep you waiting. May I ask what this is about? Should I? I'm not sure. Am I under suspicion here? And why is that? Well, if this is an X-File then why don't you ask somebody who’s I'd like to cooperate. I-I'd be happy to cooperate. I just wish Were you called about this? Has A.D. Follmer been down here? Yeah. Going through the X-Files. These. Rubbings. Taken from the surface structure of a craft. A spacecraft. Agent Doggett, if you can wrap your brain around They were found by fishermen off the western coast of Africa. Two This morning I was called into the Deputy Director's office and I A guy running the North Dakota border from Canada. Or so they say. Nothing. That they're powerful. They're not just marks, Agent Doggett. It's writing. Words. Hi. Well, what is it? What little I read was through the help of an interpreter. Yes. Based on radiometric readings from fossils that were encrusted on It'd mean that everything mankind believes in ... is in question. I didn't. I mean, I-I refused to believe it. But now I think ... I Answers about my son. I know how that sounds. I have no one else Those are questions I can't answer. That was Agent Doggett again. They're waiting. Mom, I've got to Mom, it's important.

Not What are you talking about? Wait a second. How can that be? Mom? No! No! Don't! Please! Don't! I need your help, okay? Agent Reyes, I need you to take my mom and the baby. Can you do That man -- that FBI agent -- came here to kill my baby. No, not until he tells me why. Why? Why do you want to hurt my son?! Agent Doggett, put down the phone! He has to answer me! What? Say it! Say it!! Why?! Who told you that?! He's my son! He's my son!! This is just going to be another interrogation I prefer to stand. Trying to kill my son. And why wasn't I told? Why not Agent Doggett? Why not Agent Reyes? What are you talking about? What threats? Threats to who? To me, to my child... That's what this is about? Then why pull me in here and show me An artifact. I got it from the man who was trying to kill William. It's a piece of the spacecraft. I'll tell you on the way. What is it? The only ones left we can trust. I need to know that you're taking him to a safe place. I need to Now, there's a good chance that my phone lines have been tapped and What's going on here? My baby! They're after my baby! I have to get back! I'll kill you if you touch my baby! I need to know that you're taking him to a safe place. I just had to see this for myself. To what? ... And A.D.

She's a wanted felon and a part of the UFO cult that the FBI was I asked them not to tell the FBI. I'm trying to get my son back. Before William was kidnapped, Byers was able to tuck a cell phone Then I'll find him myself. Look, what alternative do I have ... when the FBI is all but telling You coming with me? Or am I going alone? Federal Agent! Just tell me where you got this. Robert Comer wrote this, didn't he? The FBI Agent who tried to kill Take it. If I don't tell you you're good on your word, right? That means To the hospital. Look, this began when the Agent lying in that hospital crashed his With something I found in his jacket pocket in a jacket that he wore Let go. Let go of my hand.  Turn off the monitors, or they're Now, tell me who sent you to kill my son or I will take that pillow Are you saying that god asked you to kill my child? Then why does he want to kill him? What he's saying is that Mulder is dead. That that's true. That This patient does not need support. He's breathing on his own. What are we going to tell them? The FBI about Agent Comer. About what just happened. About how he They're not on our side. They will use the truth against us. How can you doubt him? I mean, after everything that you've just I never meant for this. All that's been lost. I never meant to put Agent Doggett. Oh ... Yeah, that was me. That was me talking to you. I came here to take him back. "Ephesians." I want to see my son. You killed Mulder. You told me I could see my son. You lied. What about these hills? Are we going to lose him in these hills? Well, they have to get it back. William? William! William! No ... Oh, my god. Oh, my ... William? He wanted to turn himself in? So you think he was just a crank? What connection did this dead deputy have with him? Then why did he free him? Willed him? How? Still, what does it mean? I'm sorry, I couldn't help noticing. Mulder, I'm still not sure what we're looking for. Yes, but advertise for what? I mean, how... how did this "Pusher" Inducing someone to buy hair color is a little different than Well, even if he could push his will, why would he, he cause Ohio State University? The time span of the murders. I say we run down those telephone numbers. Sorry. No luck, I take it? Okay on the trace. Okay. Phone book. Hang on a second. Yeah, it's me again. We want the last number dialed out from So he's a killer and a golfer. Mulder. I dug up a few more things on our Robert Patrick Modell. Which branch of service? Did you know that he applied to the F.B.I.? Yeah. The screener caught him in a dozen self-aggrandizing lies... Are we talking kung-fu movies, Mulder? Even if Modell could, he didn't need to. We barely had a case Please explain to me the scientific nature of the "whammy." Mulder, Modell's last known employment was as a convenience What do you need me to say, Mulder, that I believe that Modell Holly, can you tell us anything more that might help us understand Modell? I have to agree with Agent Mulder, sir. I can't even begin to Now he knows where you live. Lights coming on! Svengali. And nearby buildings too. We know that Modell likes to watch Is there anything else you can tell me? Yeah, yeah. When does It's to relieve Modell's seizures. He has temporal-lobe epilepsy. Uh, head injury, neurological disease, a brain tumor or a lesion... Mulder, those reports are completely unsubstantiated. Brought on by the brain tumor? Mulder, more to the point, if Modell did have a brain tumor, What do you mean? And he wants to go out in a blaze of glory. Mulder? No pulse. Get an ambulance. Fairfax Mercy Pharmacy... Right, thank you. The outpatient office says Modell is scheduled for a two-thirty Why? You. Take it. I'm with you, Mulder. Mulder. We're losing you! Mulder, what happened? Mulder, wait, wait. Get close to the computer monitor. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right there. You were right, Mulder. Mulder, just get out of there. Just wait for a signal from me. Mulder. We've got a dozen law enforcement officers outside in the hall... So whatever you've got planned, it's not going to work out the Wait. Mulder, look... there's pure oxygen in this room. Mulder, no. Mulder, listen to me. Give me the gun. We can stop this thing Mulder, fight him. You can fight this. There's no telling how long he'll hang on, but he'll never regain What do you mean? Why? I say we don't let him take up another minute of our time. Nature's calling. I think we should pull over soon. You wake me up on a Saturday morning, tell me to be ready in I know I'm lost as to why you're so interested in this missing It's not jurisdiction that I'm questioning, Mulder. So you think that there's a serial killer at large?  What are you leaving Most missing persons cases are not that uncommon, Mulder. Why According to the Sheriff's report, you were the last person I understand you argued over an endangered species petition. You sound bitter, Dr Farraday. Well, aside from having a motive, you don't seem too upset by And Lake Champagne, Lalavack Iceland... I did as a kid. But, then I grew up, and became a scientist. An aquatic dinosaur. You know why? Because those creatures don't exist, Mulder. They're It looks like an insect casing or Scarab or something from a No, we're with the FBI. We're investingating a pair of missing That's quite a story. Those stories must sell a lot of T-shirts. Well, his fly's undone. No, most drowning victims are found with high levels of alchohol Maybe not so big. Well, fish eat decomposing matter, any body that 's been suspended Mulder? This is Sheriff Lance Heads.  Queequeg. We'd need irrefutable proof. Mulder, a creature as large as the one you're looking for would There's your lake monster Mulder. It's all a hoax? Well, it's hard to tell without an autopsy, but it looks like Mulder, look at it out there. It's like rush hour. For all we know, he stepped in something and bled into those Regardless of what I believe, there's no hard evidence to what He's right, Mulder. Those two sets of remains we found so far Are you okay, Sheriff? I agree with you, I just wish that he gave us something more. Yeah, it could be a lot of things, Mulder. Fifteen years of Mulder, they're just a bunch of poorly composed tory shots. A tooth? I'm taking Queequeg for a walk. I'm fine.  Goodnight, Mulder.  Come Mulder... Could you repeat the last part again? I kind of faded out. After you said I'm sorry?  It's too bad we're not out here fishing. (Looking You really expect to find this thing, don't you Mulder? I'll take that as a yes. You know, on the old mariner's maps, the cartographers would What was that?  What is that? What is that, Mulder? It looks like it's coming straight at us.  Mayday! Mayday! Can anybody hear me? There goes our five hundred dollar deposit. Swim? In which direction?  Living in the city you forget a lot of things. You know what So what if it was. Mulder, what are we doing here? What are you hoping to accomplish? What for? Is that really the reason why? You know when you showed me those No, you. That man is your future. Listening only to himself, Well, as dumb as it sounds, at least it's a legitimate reason. Mulder, sometimes I just can't figure them out.(A noise is heard, Well as much as the very idea is abhorrent to me, I suppose Well, actually I have, thanks for... Poor Queequeg. It was the name of the harpoonist in Moby Dick. My father used No, how much you're like Ahab. You're so consumed by your personal It's the truth or a white whale. What difference does it make? And that's not flippant? What was that?  Dr Farraday? No, no. we had a little trouble with our boat. It was my fault. We would have been out here all night if you Walking by? What exactly is it that you're doing out here Dr Farraday? It's This is Striker's Cove? A human? Well captain, what now? Sheriff, Agent Mulder and I would appreciate it if you could What was that? I think you nipped an artery. We've got to get him to a hospital, Mulder, help is coming. Mulder! He'll be fine. How are you? Well, you slued the big white whale, Ahab. How can you be disappointed? That alligator would have gone Well, there's still hope. That's why these missing stories have       Don't look at me.  This was your idea.      I'm Agent Scully, Agent Mulder's partner.  I'm...    Uh, sir you mentioned a crisis.  Agent Mulder has been a little …    A single man?    You mean cloud seeding?    Well, sir, if this man Mootz could, in fact, somehow produce rain    And this is what you told Agent Mulder when you spoke earlier?        A man... controlling... the weather.    Mulder, I see the vacant buildings.  I see the signs.  These people    If we could get a list of all the people who have employed his    We usually just say, "please."    So you actually believe that he makes it rain?    Is it possible that he could have just followed it up there?    I'm not su...       We're Agents Mulder and Scully.  We're with the    Uh, Mr. Hardt, what can you tell us about Daryl Mootz?    You don't think he's responsible.    Thank you.    Can we go now?    I hear a big "but" coming.    Look at the desperation on these people's faces, Mulder.  They're    We just came to see the show.  I guess, uh, we're a little early.    Mulder, what are we doing here?    Mulder, that is not a rain dance.  My Irish Aunt Olive has more    He's my partner, and we prefer separate rooms.      Mulder, did they check you for    Perhaps there is.  Mr. Hardt, would you please reassure Agent    Uh... Holman just explained to us that, uh, that a mini-twister is    You two were engaged?       No.    No doubts.    Next flight out is 10
00 tomorrow morning.      Mulder, we're going home. The rain stopped this    Oh, so, now you're saying that Holman Hardt...    Mulder, it is still a huge leap to say that he's manufacturing the    "SAD"-seasonal affective disorder.      Mulder, it's me.      I'm not so sure.  Have you looked outside lately?  It's      Holman?      Dating advice? From whom?      I heard you.  Mulder, when was the last time you went      The blind leading the blind.       Mulder, the fog has lifted and if you're ready...    A bit. Why?    Thunderstorms, I think.    Seven inches in the past six hours.  The national weather service    Holman was just telling us that, uh, that he wanted to dance.    Sheila...   my partner has a theory and even though      What?    What?    Well, it seems to me that the best relationships-- the ones that    The storm drains are filling up.  Let's get out of here.    I called the police.    Wet? What does that mean? What does the police report say? Any evidence of sexual assault? Does it seem like it might have been a schoolboy prank? Victims? You mean there've been others? What's your interest in this? What's that? What's the significance of the name "Red Museum?" You know sheriff, from what little we've seen, what, what little What are walk-ins? Hi. Who are you? Oh, you're in all the pictures. You must be Gary's younger brother. Well, thank you for your time. You know, Mulder... ribs like these, I'd say the Church of the To inhabitation by a new spirit. But not Nixon? So are you still subscribing to the sheriff's claims of a possession? Well, I'll tell you something, I kind of feel weird saying this... Yeah, what, what's going on? Mulder? Kind of hard to tell the villains without a scorecard. I just examined the girl. Not much until the toxicology report came back. They found trace Well, only in very small doses. Anything past .2 micrograms Yes, you'd probably have to be a doctor or a pharmacist to get We can get a warrant if that's what it takes. Yes, sir, but you can't hide behind your rights if a crime has Are you familiar with a substance called scopolamine, Mister Have you ever ordered others to do so? Yes. Why did you sell it? You said you wanted to show us something. A genetically-engineered growth hormone. How do you mean? But these hormones have been proven safe. They've been cleared What about the second body? Thank you. I think we'll know more once we find out what this is. You're sure? Both kids? No, it's okay, I'm... I'm sure you're You found a connection between the out-of-town kids and the Why would he carry a list of credit card numbers? But why? And what was he treating them for? I don't know. We won't get the test results back on the vial I know. And it still doesn't answer the question of who's marking Hi. Sorry to come unannounced. Actually, we wanted to talk with you, if that's okay. Well, thinking back, was there anything that seemed strange Why was he going to Doctor Larson? Jay's your husband? What accident? What is it, Mulder? What? His name is Gerd Thomas. He's owned the building for twenty-one I know that face. Excuse me. Mulder? I, uh... I think he's telling the truth. I don't think he killed I just got the toxicology report back on the broken vial. The The man who died in that plane crash was inoculating those kids No, Mulder, that was never proven conclusively. Yes. Does that man know anything about it? Well, I think his boss must have because they just found him I think I know who shot him, Mulder. That man that I recognized Sheriff... where's Mulder? Don't move! File number XWC060361. The identity of the man shot in the slaughterhouse Under further analysis, the inoculant found in the broken vials    I suggest you postpone the transfer.  We can get him out later once the       Somebody call a medic!    Do you recognize this, Mr. Wells?  Have you seen it before?    This key card, Mr. Wells...  you do recognize it.  Is that correct?    It is yours.  It was found in the dumpster behind the Strand Hotel.    Mr. Wells, we understand that you had an interesting morning in court.    Are you saying that you don't remember?  What is the last thing that you do    Yes... You do.    Mr. Wells, this shooting aside is there anything else that you remember    That was three days ago, Mr. Wells.  Are you telling us that you don't    If you truly don't remember...  then how can you be certain that you didn't?    It's nice to meet you.  I'm sorry it's not under better circumstances.    Mr. Wells, are you saying that you don't remember the day that your wife    You do realize that you're not going to be able to prove this, right?  I mean,    It means you're going to have to tell us all over again.    Mr. Wells, let's say that, that all this is true.  Why do you think it's    What reason?    Maybe you already have the answer within you. Mulder? What are you doing? Why are you sitting in my bedroom I'm not kidding, Mulder. What are you talking about, Mulder? What's going on? (Mulder That's the dead man in your apartment? How did he die, Mulder? Have you contacted anybody at the Bureau? What are you talking about? That the hoax is connected to the military, just like Kritschgau What? This is a PBX operator at the Bureau. Who would he be calling at the FBI? Mulder, how long has this been going on? That would mean that for 4 years we've been nothing more than Mulder, we can't go to the Bureau making these accusations. Yes, sir.  I'm um.... I don't know what to say. They asked me to come down I saw Mulder earlier this morning. He was wearing the same clothes. Yes, sir. Four years. Yes, sir. But that's not why I'm here. Yes, that's right.

You're going Except proof. The cruelest ironies are those consecrated by the passage of There it is. My DNA hybridized with the viral DNA from the cell culture. I know. I believe that I was exposed to this material and that it is One which cannot be cured. Yes sir. Four years ago, Section Chief Blevins assigned me to Yes, sir. (Mulder comes out of the door he ducked through earlier What I couldn't tell Agent Mulder what I had only just learned Early this morning, I got a call from the police... asking me Agent Mulder died late last night from an apparent self-inflicted Yes, sir. Yes, sir. But I have proof against the men behind this... of Mulder, what are you doing here? Mulder, somebody's going to see you here. What happened? Mulder, don't try and protect me. I need to know. Did you find out who in the FBI is involved? Yes it does. Mulder, Skinner has evidence against you. He knows that you Mulder, Skinner's dirty. He's not your friend. I'm almost certain If you testify, he will use it to ruin you. (He puts his hand He's been in a position to know everything from the beginning, Well then, you have to lay it on me. You have to tell them that Yes, you can. Mulder, if I can save you, let me. Let me at least Hi, Mom. I think ... that everybody here has their heart in the right I know you're only looking out for me, Bill. But I don't think Yes. I am. I'd like to try this. Um... either it's my head or I'm a long way from med school You're not holding your breath are you? Have you ever witnessed a miracle, Dr. Zuckerman? Isn't that a miracle? Thank you. I'm so sorry... I fight and I fight and I fight... But I'm so I've come so far in my life on simple faith, and now when I But I have. In a way. And when you asked Father McCue to dinner I'm not getting better, Mom. Yeah. The PET scan shows no improvement. What are you doing here? You have a hearing. Came by for what? Mulder, what is it? A deal with who? What happened this morning? Are you going to name him? Then they'll prosecute you. Mulder, even with the ballistics evidence, I can still be the Then why'd you come here if you'd already made up your mind? You'll be in my prayers.  Jane Doe.

As you asked, I compared the wounds inflicted on your son with the There are similarities between the trajectory of the wounds and the Meaning that it was a brilliant forensic deduction on Cadet Hayes's It's all in there. How you defrauded the FBI with a false identity Because Nicholas Regali did not kill Agent Doggett's son. You did. And then, you killed Agent Doggett's son. Well, he told us his story. Whether it's true ...    So much of the work that we do cannot be measured in standard terms.    We open doors with the X-Files, which lead to other doors.       I believe that there was once a conspiracy.  I believe I was taken    I've seen things that I cannot deny.    Oh, Mulder, how many times have they tried to shut us down?    Did you hurt him?       Billy, are you all right?        I don't know how we could possibly justify the expense.    Let's go waste some money.    You're married, Billy.    Why not?    Agent Scully, Agent Mulder.    I watched Agent Mulder paint that there seven years ago.    Detective?  Did the, uh... deputy carry a .38?    Three shells were discharged.  I image they could have rolled from up there.    Was the missing deputy a good cop?    Married? Single?       Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Hoese.  We're with the FBI.    We, uh... we came to see if there's anything that you could tell us that might    What do you see?    What do you see?    Once upon a time there was a little baby.       It's me.    I don't know what's wrong.    I, um...  I was starting to get ready for bed and I started to feel really dizzy--    No, I just... I just want to get warm.    Thank you.    What?    Oh, Mulder, I'm going to be fine.    Who's right?    How do you know?    Yeah.  I have.  We both have.    It's a biological toxin emitted as a gas through the bloodstream.    From what is arguably an alien.    Yeah.    Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.    Mulder...    I just...  I just...  I just hit the ground.    Why is this happening to me?    What the hell's going on, Mulder?    Warn him of what?    Billy?    Mulder?    Mulder, if any of this is true...       Forget about it?    What are you talking about?    Mulder...    I won't let you go alone.    This just can't be.    Medical records-- Billy Miles and other known abductees in Bellefleur,    Which is exactly what Mulder experienced earlier this year.    There was something out there in that field.  It knocked me back.  Because it    Scully?    Hi.    I'm feeling fine.  They're just running some tests on me.    I already heard.       We will find him.  I have to.    Sir, um... there's something else I need to tell you.  Something that I need for    I'm having a hard time explaining it. Or believing it.  But, um...    I'm pregnant. These ligature marks on his neck are consistent with rope or Stigmata? I don't see any wounds here on his hands or wrists or otherwise. What are you doing? Others? According to certain religious lore, at any given time there are Eleven? Any clue as to the motivation? Well, that narrows down the field. You said on the phone that there had been a previous incident. Was that the case? How's he doing? Hi, Kevin. My name is Dana Scully. Can I talk to you a minute? We don't know just yet. Right now, we have to find out what No, you can't tell me, or no, you don't know? I don't want you to say anything that isn't true. He feels a bit feverish. Did you take his temperature? You're a very brave boy, Kevin. You have nothing to be afraid of. I don't know. The kid's hands were definitely cut, Mulder. Have you determined how his hands were cut? Maybe we should talk to his father. His father said that he needed to be protected. Yes. How did you know that? Armageddon? Full circle to find the truth? I don't know what that means. Kevin was abducted from this room. Several of the children Did you get a composite? This isn't the killer, Mulder. No, I mean it doesn't match the MO. None of the previous victims You know this man? Kevin? If it's not you, then who is it? Mr. Jarvis, my religious convictions are hardly the issue here. Don't! You'll be OK. You'll be OK. Owen Lee Jarvis, adult caucasion male. 42 years of age.  Mulder, would you do me a favor? You don't detect a faint floral odor? Mulder, this man's body is in no way decomposing normally. St. Cecilia, St. Francis ... I don't know. Well, what do you think this is? Well, isn't a saint or a holy person just another term for someone I ... believe in the idea that God's hand can be witnessed. Maybe that's just what faith is. Got your message. What did you turn up? What? Any evidence as to how the killer managed to do that? A powerful and respected man. Israel? Yeah, it's when people who visit the Holy Land suffer religious Yeah, but it still doesn't explain how he was able to burn his It's Kevin, isn't it? It was an accident, Kevin. Your mother was only trying to protect I don't know. But I won't let him hurt you. I promise. How are you different, Kevin?  Kevin? Agent Mulder and I are gonna take you back to the shelter. No ... No, you don't. Why don't you duck back inside. I want to keep him with us, Mulder, until Gates is apprehended. Yes. I'll wait right outside. Kevin has a cut under his ribs. No, I ... I was with the paramedics when they were looking at him. No, Mulder, I was paying close attention. Yesterday, I saw Kevin's hands. They were bleeding from There have been other signs. I haven't said anything until now, How Kevin was able to be in two places at once ... How is it that you're able to go out on a limb whenever you see a Well, what about what I've seen? Kevin? You OK?  I wasn't out of that room for more than two minutes, Mulder. Kevin's father. He knew that Kevin was in danger. He warned us about a Maybe he is. Well, it's not doing us a lot of good standing around here. You've never seen him before? You really don't know? Haloperidol. It's a powerful anti-psychotic. They've increased Mulder, look. Arrows that form a circle. Full circle to find the I don't think so, Mulder. I don't know. Look, if I'm wrong, I'll meet you out at the airport. Stop! Federal agent, I'm armed! Let him go! Let him go and No! Kevin! Hold on! Hold on! You all set? Maybe I'll see you again sometime. Yeah, I think so. I'd appreciate it if you'd handle that alone, Mulder. I have an I'll see you at the airport. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been six years since No, um, there's a man that I work with - a friend - and usually No, I'm talking about events that defy explanation. Things that Because my partner didn't see them. He didn't ... he didn't Is that possible? To find my way back? Mostly, it just makes me afraid. Afraid that God is speaking ... but that no one's listening.    Damn.       Hey, it's Scully.  Good morning.       Well, actually, I'm out of town.  I'm … north       The, uh, local coroner wants a consultation       From what they're telling me, he is a, uh,       Well, it was just a, uh, a simple consultation...       Well, actually, there might be, if you don't mind.       Unfortunately, I , uh, don't remember any       Yeah, mucous... But it was, uh, unable to       I'm sorry?       No, no, no, just, uh, just mucous.  Look,       Thank you.    Hello?    Good … thanks.  I, uh, I was wondering.  A bus came    Do you know what's up that road?    Uh, can I ask what happened to your hand?    Yeah.  There was a, uh, murder out here last week about    Yeah.  Well, you're going to want to wash this out.    Yeah, well, I also sound like a doctor.    Yeah.  Can you sell me some gas?    I got a... quarter tank, I think.  I'll make it.  It's all right.    Thanks.    Oh, that's great.  Thank you.    Where is "here," exactly?  'Cause I can't seem to find    Thank you very much.    Okay.    Hey.  Excuse me.  You put something in my tank that    Where's that gas can?  I'd like to see it, please.    That's water.  I barely even smell any gasoline.    Oh, and it rains a lot here, does it?  Seeing as how it's    Yeah. I'm going to use your phone.   You don't have a phone.  So how did you call up the   Hello?  Hello?    Hi.    Mr. Milsap?    Yes, I hope so.  My, uh, car has stalled up the street   The line's dead.    How long?    I won't be here that long.    What the hell is going on here?    I get the distinct impression that somebody doesn't    A bus came through here about an hour ago.  Where did it go?    Don't tell me you didn't see it.    Excuse me.  Ma'am, excuse me.  Ma'am.  Excuse me, ma'am.    Hello?  Ma'am, I need some help.    Hello?    Hello?    Let go.  Don't hold him down.    How long has he been seizing?    It's okay. You're all right.  You're okay.    What's his name?    He had a grand mal seizure.  As far as I can tell, he's    How did this happen?    Uh-huh.  At any rate, we need to get him to a hospital.    I assume that your phone's still not working.    Well, do you or one of your "friendly" neighbors happen    No cars?    All right, do you... um … do you have any Karo syrup?    Yeah, you can hold off now.    I'm sorry, but, uh... I'm just winging it here.  I mean,    Well, I'm afraid that I have done all that I can do …    Hey, hey.  Can you hear me?  How are you feeling?    Yes.  I am.    Well, I'm not sure if I've actually done anything.  In fact,    You don't remember do you?  How about how you got here?    What about these people who have taken you in?    Yeah, I'll say they take very good care of you.  The sun    A murder took place about 20 miles from here.  A man    FBI.  And I need to get you out of here, but I don't know how.   I understand.    Hang … hang on a second.  Just let me look at something,    All right.    Hold on,  hold on.    He's coming to.  Hey.   Can you hear me?  How are you feeling?    It's lucky they're still listening to you for the time being.    This... wound in your back... it seems to be a point of    I don't know how far this extends or how to get it out of    You will die if we cannot treat you properly.  Now, these    Now, I have no idea what the motives of these people are--    No kidding.    I'm going to try and get us the hell out of here.    These, uh... people tell me that they have no cars.  I don't    I'm going to go take a look around, okay?    You know how to use a gun?    I'll be back soon.    Hey.  How'd you...?    You had me convinced.        I'm a Federal Agent!  At this moment, the FBI    No!  Ahhh!!!  You son of a bitch!    You just murdered him!    No.  No!  I'm pregnant!  No!  No, don't do this!    No!  Don't do this!  No!  I'm going to have a baby!    No!  No!  No!  No!    What did you put in me?!  I'm going to get every last one    Him?!  That thing in my spine is a "him"?!    Help!  Help!  Help!    Help!  Help!    Help!  Help!    Agent Doggett.   Get me the hell out of here.    I don't know.   How far is your car?    I know something closer.    Can you hot-wire it?    You got to cut it out.  Cut it out. Oh... Oh...  Now it's       Cut it out of me now!    Aah!  Just do it, Doggett!    Yeah, I'm ready to go.    They believe they worshipped Christ.  That that thing was    Look, I, uh... I wanted to apologize.  I … I left you out of    And I won't do it again. You mean the part where the groom passed out or the May-be.  So is  The Icarus project? And Ronald Surnow was an aeronautical scientist who How close are they? OK, but how is this an X-file? Mulder, you don't think this How do you suppose he became trapped in the wind tunnel? By computer? Another member of your team died a short time ago. Are you certain it was an accident? Your work seems to be a perfect target for industrial How do you know? Do you remember seeing anything unusual? Seeing any You must like stars. Sorry? Roland, let me help you. What is it? You don't really think that Roland ... Yes, but we're talking about a sophisticated fluid dynamics Yes, but even savants behave only as human calculators. An organic object exposed to liquid nitrogen at minus 320 But look, someone else entered a file under the name Arthur Well, it couldn't have been Keats. Judging from the rigor Well, I can't access the ARTHUR file. We're gonna need How did you know that that ... How did you know what the password was? Mrs. Stodie, can I talk to you a second? Has Roland ever mentioned the name Arthur? Mrs. Stodie, can I get a copy of Roland's file and past I understand, but I have grounds to obtain them, and the Are you suggesting that Arthur Grable hired Roland in order Yeah, but by the look of this, (she holds up a photo of  This obituary says that Arthur Does it say when he was born?  That's also Arthur's birthdate. Is that Arthur Grable there, sitting on the chair? Was he a practical joker? Could he have faked his own death? How can you be so certain? Wouldn't your client find it somewhat inconvenient to be May we take a look at Arthur Grable's records? (he hands Mulder? Arthur Grable put down only one donor. No, lose the whole beard. That's Roland. Mulder, no one's gonna provide you with anything once you Yeah. I've got an older one and a younger one. Does this pitch somehow end with a way for me to lower OK, maybe. But in this case, one sibling has closer ties to But why? He's been working with these colleagues for years. OK. Let's go. I have to call my brother. Let's talk to campus security. No, we go left. Arthur and Roland Grable, born at Puget Presbyterian to Which means that they're the result of a single egg So that maybe Roland's condition is the result of a damaged In a way.   Agent Scully. Uh-huh. Was there any tissue damage?   Someone tampered with Arthur  Wait.  Roland, we need you to Try to remember how. Roland, you've got to help him or He'll be held in psychiatric custody for evaluation. The D.A. hasn't made that determination yet. We're not sure, Mrs. Stodie. All we know is that Roland    Slow going.  Let's just say I had ample time to read the police    Sheriff's deputy is slain during a routine patrol.  It's a tragic    Yes, but that's according to the young man who's accused of    Mulder, tell me you've got more than SAT scores to show that    Oh, my God, it looks like he was hit with a sledgehammer.    The damage to the maxillofacial bones and the cranium is    Ugh.  His eyeglasses.    Well, maybe if he was under the influence of PCP or some    Well, even so, I mean, stress and fear may have triggered an    Sheriff, we don't mean to second-guess you.    Well, that might make things worse and they seem pretty bad    If you didn't do it, it's all the more reason to clear it up.    Tony, you're not likely to get a fairer hearing than this.    16 years old and his life is over unless he starts telling the truth.    I'm not saying he's guilty, Mulder.  I'm inclined to agree that    What kind of force?      Mulder.  Rather than spirits... can we       Chastity Raines?  I'm Agent Scully.    Do you?    Do you realize that Tony could go to prison for the rest of his    A "Betty"?      Scully.    What about the murder weapon?    How many people have access to this room?      What does the tape show?    Can we take a look at the surveillance tape?    No one's saying that you are, Sheriff.    Could there be a malfunction with the VCR?    What am I supposed to be seeing?    Sorry to make you trek over here for what's probably a glitch.    Especially since ghosts don't go around leaving synthetic    I think we can rule that out.    Which is impossible because it only appears for a single frame.    Scag?    What?    Excuse me, please.  Thank you.        Based on the    The ones we found in the evidence room?    You think Max did this?  Based on what?    Well, he may have had motive but he didn't have opportunity.    Well, Mulder, he's a teenager.  Everything about him is changing.    That's your theory?    Sheriff, we'd like to ask your son a few questions if that's okay.       High temperature and heart rate,    That's not going to happen any time soon.  Your condition's    There's some test results missing from Max's chart.    Hot off the presses.    This can't be right.    Oh, my God.    Evidence of cerebral lesions from repeated concussions...    In a teenager?  I can't even imagine.  This is the kind of thing    Yeah.    Mulder...    Yes, Mulder, but it's impossible.  The human body just isn't    Well, it's too soon to tell.  He's unconscious and bleeding    Why would he leave it behind?  You think he's doing it to    But if he can do what you claimed then... then who could    Tony.  How do we find him?    The woods near where the deputy was killed.    Did the USGS show up?    And what did they come up with?    What'd you expect them to find, Mulder?    Well, you and I were both in there and nothing happened to us.    Well, that's doubtful.  But no more so than any other theory.    Bruises and muscle strains, mostly.  He'll recover... go back to    Well, it's highly unlikely that wherever he is he feels like picking up the    Hmm.  It's interesting, isn't it?  I mean, uh... in light of the evidence.    From their size and shape, these look like men's shoes.    Well, these impressions in the asphalt look pretty fresh to me.    You're right, which is suspicious in and of itself.  I mean, this car definitely    Well, it looks like he tried to.    Unless he wanted to stop the car.    Or certainly no ordinary man.    Agent Doggett!    Meet Curtis Delario.    I guess he won't be much help clearing any of this up.    So do I.  It wasn't the crash that killed Curtis Delario.  He was badly injured,    Yeah, these five deep puncture marks match five fingers of one hand.    Like a bowling ball.    Certainly for any ordinary man.    Whose?    Hmm.    Well, if he was recently deceased then it must have been an old print.       Scully.       Paint?       Hang on.       Uh... no.  Is it significant?       To do what?       And you think it was Ray?    But the man with the gun is dead.       Or being hit by a car.       Well, maybe the question's not how but why?  I mean, if Ray       Scully.       Did you find Dr. Clifton?       What kind of conceptual work?       I wonder.  As it happens Ray Pearce's illness is pretty       Does it, Agent Doggett?       Well, maybe there's a reason why he's not being perfectly    It's all right.  I just got the blood test back on Ray Pearce and it was indeed    But then the question is, why kill his friends?  I mean, if he was wronged    This was ten years ago.    Until three days ago.    Agent Doggett, the man that we're speaking about withstood impact from a    Dr. Puvogel, are you sure he can't open that door from the inside?    Ray Pearce.    Get it open!    Agent Doggett.  Look at this.  You see this?    Turning itself into metal.    Not without cause.    Do you recognize this man?    Of what?    And it poisoned him.       Let me talk to you for a second.       I think he's telling the truth.    Who is it?    She was looking for something.    That makes three people.  Three people that he's killed and for what?    Whatever Ray is, whatever he's become, it was an accident.  It was not those    No, they were innocent, just like Ray was.  They didn't know that this was    Oh, so that's what this is about?  This is about looking for somebody to    So who is it?  It's the CEO here?  The owner?  Give us a name, Mrs. Pearce,    Ray Pearce.    This man, Owen Harris?  He begged for his life.  It might just have saved    Wherever Ray Pearce went, the answer to that question went with him but I    Well, I think that, uh, Nora Pearce may have been right.  Her husband died,    Nor mercy.  Unless what drove Ray to kill is also what saved those people.    Some flicker of humanity. Doctor Lloyd, are you currently taking any kind of medication? Would you mind allowing me to check the dosage, and which Doctor Lloyd, you say that you’ve taken sleeping pills. The sleeping pill he was taking was something called Somanil. It’s popular because it works directly on the central  Well, he started taking the drug five  Yeah. You know, that’s more than a pill a day. An addiction which very well could have altered his ability Judging from his schedule the day of the accident, hundreds, You’re missing my point here, Mulder. This – this And a brand new, state of the art facility like this can What? Well, they look like they were made by, uh, the coasters  Mulder, if you want to connect Maybe they were all possessed. Uh, we’re with the FBI. I’m Agent Scully, and this  You’re Rebecca Could you explain to me what happened to Dr. Lloyd. Did you observe Dr. Lloyd at all before the accident?  Uh, Dr. Shannon, can we have a word Yeah, there’s magic going on here, Mulder, only it’s being You wanted to show me something? Stop it a second. (Tape show Lloyd stabbing with Well, presuming that has anything to do with this, who Well, then it doesn’t even make sense. But there’s no other evidence of anything like witchcraft The sleeping pills?

Sorry to barge in, but this is a matter of some urgency. Finally. Do you have any other reasons to suspect her? On the suspicion of being a witch? What could she have been doing in here?

What are you thinking, Mulder? This kind of transformation is medically impossible.  Blood sacrifice? So this man committed these murders in order to make himself Look, he’s inscribed all the names of the patients who Mulder, in here. Where are you going?  You have to stop this procedure immediately. I’m Special Agent Dana Scully. I’m an FBI agent. Listen to me! I’m a doctor. I’m a federal agent. That’s exactly what I’m trying to prevent. Well, they saved her life.

And what makes you think this is an X-File?  ... and yet the coroner concludes that she stabbed herself to death.  Agent Harrison I see no reason to disagree with the coroner.  Look, it is unusual but I have seen it before.  I'm sorry, Agent Harrison but unless you have other evidence ...  Uh, unless you bring me Spanky, there's nothing I can do.  Apple and tuna salad?

I didn’t expect you to be standing right there behind Maybe you should come down here, Mulder. (to You, uh … you said these trees were dying. Is Lisa still staying with you? Mulder, whatever you’re hoping we find here – without Mulder … Where’s the body? Mulder, you still haven’t answered my question. No. That’s what we were doing. What do you mean? I’m a little afraid to ask what kind of connection. Bobby’s father, Lisa’s father … Mulder, there is a connection between these deaths What? So nature did it for them? I called Lisa at her aunt’s house 20 minutes ago Mulder, we’ve already questioned him twice. Mulder … What the hell is going on here? But how did he get here? Mulder, I … You think Karin is the killer? You’re going to be okay.    Mulder?    What are you doing?    About?    Mind if I turn on a light?    Skinner is royally pissed.  At you.

You're personalizing this case.  You're identifying    There are a lot of good agents up there in Skinner's office who do not have    You told them that they were wrong, Mulder.    Why did you do it?    That was utterly irresponsible, Mulder.  It was out of line and it was without    She was convicted in a court of law.    I can't explain it, Mulder, but you're doing exactly what I said.  You're    How?    What if they're dead, Mulder?  Don't go looking for something you don't    Sir?    I need to have a word with Agent Mulder.    No, it can't, sir.       Mulder, your mom's dead.    Mulder?    What is it?    Was there a note?    Mulder...    We never truly know why.    Who?       Oh, no, Mulder.  Please don't ask me to do this.    An autopsy, Mulder?  I mean, it's one thing on a stranger but you're my    How could she know that, Mulder?      Mulder...    Your mother killed herself, Mulder.  I conducted the autopsy.  She was    Mulder …    Mulder, she was trying to tell you to stop.  To stop looking for your sister.    Hi.    It's been a hard night for him.    It's not a good...    Well, then you better book three.    Mulder, we just got here.    How do you know that?    Well, what about the handwritten note?

It won't help much to Have you seen either of these two men before? Take your time. I'm afraid you have.  Have you ever seen this person before? (It's the still A woman her size breaking free and out running those men? She knows who the other person in that photo is. What the hell's going on? Yeah.

How did you know? Lauren Kyte. Yes, there is. His body's tissues and organs were donated. The tests are conclusive, the dura matter does belong to Howard You know, you're not under arrest. You're just here for What case? You're the ones who've been withholding information. Lauren? But you believe it. That's not enough. You've been given the chance to tell Mulder, there's no such thing as ghosts or psychokinesis. I'm giving us a chance to solve a case that's tangible instead All right, everyone. We have a warrant to search the premises Lets go.  Everybody stay calm. Federal Bureau of Investigation. Let's get out of here. (Mulder walks to Lauren still Mulder!

So we can't talk about Mr. Parkers federal court case Well, Joseph Goodensnake is dead with a wound from The creeps? The victim was shot there, about three meters from where Well, there seems to be nothing unexplainable about this Mulder, this is so odd. It's almost like a snakeskin that's Well, we're going to have to take a look at the body We're looking for any individuals who might be able to Sheriff Tskany? (she extends her hand but the sheriff Take a look at that scar tissue. Looks like he'd been attacked by an animal as well. No. Those wounds have been healing for quite some time. Well, could his records have been switched or misplaced? Well, there are cases of calcium phosphate salts So Parker saw what he wanted to see, an animal. I'm fully qualified. But you're a law enforcement officer. You can't destroy Mulder, since we've been here, you've acted as if you've Sounds like the Parker scenario. This file indicates that they started again in 1954. Here it comes. Mulder, what this, what this folder describes is called Mulder, even if you're right and Joe Goodensnake did Gwen ... I just wanted to say that I'm sorry about your brother. Gwen, I don't know what to say. I'm ... By the way the body's been mutilated, I'd say he's been Have you talked to Gwen Goodensnake? She seemed And what about Lyle Parker? He could be dead as well. I'll take a look around. Mulder! Mulder, I'm taking Lyle to the hospital. He's When you did go home, did you talk to your father? Your father's dead. I'm sorry.  I don't know. Power's out. You OK? Lyle? Let me come in. Lyle, I want to take you back to Lyle? Lyle, answer me. Lyle, are you all right?  It's OK, it's me. It's me.  OK. Oh my God!  He was in the Maybe.    Snakes.    Oh, my God.

I mean, serpents and religion have gone    These particular serpents actually were serving Evil?    But...?    Animus enough to motivate a murder?    Snake handling.

Are you speaking about the Devil's test or your test?    Tennessee.  Snakes.  Thank you, Mulder.  Thank you so much.    Well, Mulder, there are other people in his congregation.      Gracie we're investigating the leader of your former    Gracie, that sounds like something that Reverend O'Connor    I think I'll check around back.   Oh!!    Gracie.  You still don't believe your father did it?    I guess it's looking less and less like he's a suspect.    Well, if so, Mulder, the jury's still out.  I just spoke to his    He's not receiving it.    Gracie stepped in.  She's trying to forbid treatment on religious      Well, more to the point, Mulder, what if she    Well, she grew up around snakes, Mulder.  Who's to say she    So, what's he scared of?    Though I don't understand it, O'Connor's church exerts a strong    It's an intolerant culture, Mulder.    You're saying that you, Fox Mulder, would welcome someone    Which turns out to be more or less the case.  Based on this,    So maybe he was killed because he discovered the truth.    How could Gracie have possibly gotten him out of here?    Mulder, he was on his deathbed; that's impossible.  And besides,      Enoch O'Connor is.    How is she?    What happened here?  Where's the baby?    Snakes.     She gave birth to snakes.    Where are you going?    Gracie, it's Agent Scully.  We're taking you to the doctor right    Can you tell me what happened, Gracie?    You're safe, Gracie.  My partner's gone after him.    Where's Mulder?    Mulder?!    Still no trace...  even though every law enforcement agency in    He's just a man, Mulder.  Just like O'Connor.

Went through my files,  Without that report as evidence, Skinner’s not going to  Skinner?  You actually met with him.   Do you trust him No, seriously. Caudal appendages. Fetuses have them. Their coccyx So would I. No, Mulder I think you're right, I think that So uh, so what else about this interests you? Could it be Did you experience any unusual complications during your Did he have a light saber?  How many times have you seen Star Okay. Thank you. Uh huh.  Okay. All right, I got it. Thank you.  I think you're right, Mulder. (she opens the door. Mulder Good.  You see here, these identical band I should have thought of it sooner. This kind of appended Though he most likely had it surgically removed somewhere Birds and the bees and the monkey babies, Mulder. Well yeah, he's the only one in town. So you're thinking that the doctor might have something Settle down, nobody's going to be arrested. Five out of five. No. There's a few things we have to clear up first. You're the father of five children Mr Van Blundht. Is that not You had sex with these women? How is it that none of them I do.  On, uh, on behalf It's been called the date rape drug. High doses of it cause Well he identified these women through his janitorial job at I think it's enough to keep him in custody while we check it Deputy, are you sure you don't remember what happened After hitting him over the head. Van Blundht somehow physically transformed into his captor Mulder, why can't you just go for the simple answer? With that Two men, roughly the same build, same coloring. The addition But what are you saying, that that Van Blundht is an alien? Hopefully myself. Looking like someone else, Mulder, and being someone else All right, then. Eleanor Roosevelt. Why the hell not? Yes. He, uh, attacked a sheriff's deputy during his escape Fortunately not. Sir, do you have any idea where your son might be? No!  No. No thank you. Uh no, actually I didn't. Eddie junior, not senior.  What? It's difficult to say. The quicklime burned the tissue even as That would be this. It's striated muscle tissue. In and of itself, nothing. Where I found it however - Everywhere. His entire body. As far as I can tell, this man In other words, there are six hundred and fifty four muscles Possibly. It could be a linked gene birth defect. You got me, Mulder. Maybe none. It appears to be atrophied, What do you mean? Maybe. What are you suggesting? Isn't it much more likely, Mulder, that this man simply has Where are you going? ... and one single woman who didn't.  Scully. I'm on my way. What's going on? What the hell happened? You got a lead on him? So what? That's it for us? Now you think there's no X-File here? Yes, sir. The subject, Edward Van Blundht senior, died of Most likely. I entered him into the national sex offenders database. Well, seeing as how it's Friday, I was thinking I could get "Diminished Acetylcholine Production in Recidivist Though actually I might bag that though. Yeah, I have to say, Mulder, the anomalous musculature in  Mulder, what's up? No. No uh...come on in. (she sees that he's carrying a Okay. Have a seat. More autopsy data. You know, everyone at the lab found Mr Yes, it is. So seriously Mulder, what's going on? You okay? What do you mean like...really talk? No, no we don't, Mulder. So there we are at two o'clock in the morning, me and my I'm thinking "what is that siren I hear getting louder?" It wasn't the cops it was the fire department. My friend ... had built this campfire that went totally out of control No, I'm seeing a whole new side of you, Mulder. I like it. What do you mean? Career wise? Miles off target. Do you?  I don't imagine you need to be told this Mulder, but you're Two apparent abductions in less than a month, and then Her name is Kelly Ryan. She was one of my students when Kelly? Hi. This is Agent Mulder. Uh, the heat register. What is it? Was Patrick Newirth a smoker? Well, that's strange for someone who works for a tobacco Could be the residue from burnt human flesh. What are you thinking, Mulder? You're doing just fine. Having a little fun? Spontaneous human combustion? Let's just forget for the moment that there's no scientific Darkness covers a multitude of sins. Neat trick. For your birthday, I'll buy you a utility belt. Look at this, Mulder. Margaret Wysnecki, age 66. Widowed, retired from Laramie Yeah, you're probably right. The first missing person, That's the same day she disappeared. And Gail Anne Lambert ... uh, no it doesn't say anything Well, even so, what's the significance? And whatever happened to spontaneous human combustion? What happened here, Kelly? Well, you were just doing your job. You just make sure you hang onto this case. These ideas of yours, Mulder, you care to share them? You don't have a clue, do you? All right, where does this leave us? How? Those are the dates that Margaret Wysnecki and Patrick That's assuming we're looking for a guy. It could be any one of these people, Mulder ... or none Again? Chances are, he's not walking around carrying a sign with Looking at the floor. Probably the same reason he spends his whole afternoon That's where the first victim worked. Looks like it's been closed up. We're agents Mulder and Scully with the FBI. You mean he's not any more? Subatomic particles. Except no one knows if they truly exist. This is a particle accelerator. Exactly what happened here? How did he survive? Well, this looks like the same kind of material that they What do you think it is? Well, whatever it is, we have to find him. There's no sign of him, Mulder. Maybe he's moved on. Well, maybe the exposure affected his mind. I called Detective Ryan. She's having the prints on the No, I only told her that he was a possible suspect, and Like a motive, like a murder weapon, like ... What do you mean? Looking for his shadow? The accident in the lab ... the quanta bombardment ... But it has something to do with dark matter. That's how you killed Gail Anne Lambert? Agent Mulder and I are here strictly in an unofficial We were curious about the unexplained nature of the case. Come on, Mulder, let's go. What do you mean? Ambition? She's a woman trying to survive the boys' club, Look. The fact is, we have no jurisdiction here. I'm sure all the necessary precautions will be taken. You don't believe all this paranoia about brain sucking, Mulder, as brilliant as Dr. Banton may be, he is also clearly Look, I don't know how to explain it, but that's not our job. Mulder. Richmond PD had two officers outside watching the entrance. Three? The power was disconnected at a substation two Somebody from the government coming for Dr. Banton? That's what Detective Ryan thinks. She was in charge of Dr. Banton's transfer and arraignment Where? Mulder, wait. Where are we going? I heard him say a lot of things. Wait a second. That's still just a theory, and it's a pretty And apparently so does whoever it is that tried to take him We're not the first ones here, Mulder, that's Detective Mulder. What's that noise? Mulder. He must have killed her and then killed himself. By who? I'm not sure how to feel about this, Mulder. She was This shouldn't have happened. This never should have Doing what? I'm not sure I follow you. Do they have any leads or know where he might be? But you do. Well, if Banton's not dead, then where is he? What did the note say? Why the cloak and dagger routine? Think it's a crank? Hi.  Special Agent Dana Scully. What brings you to Washington? How do you mean? Do you have any idea who may have sent that to you? Why would somebody want to sabotage the Space Shuttle? And we thought we could rest easy with the fall of the Soviet Union. Evidence of what? Oh, of course. What? You remember all that stuff? Guess I missed that phase. Col. Belt,  I'm Special Agent Dana Scully.  (Shakes Belt's hand as he rises and	This found its way to the FBI.   Do you have any reason to believe that the damage done to it was in an effort to Do you have any reason to suspect sabotage at all? Looking at this evidence, sir, would you consider postponing the shuttle flight Col. Belt, has an internal investigation ever been done on this matter?   Thank you.    Didn't you want to It came to us anonymously. What doesn't make sense? Is it conceivable that in order to avoid these delays, the program is being And who makes the final determination as to its safety?  What do you think? You think Col Belt knows more than he's saying?  That he lied about his So you think this x-ray is bogus? Yeah, it ranks right up there with getting a pony and learning how to braid my Do you think this is sabotage? Yeah, but they usually fix them, right? She's turning. Michelle! Can you move? Be careful. It's okay.  Now don't try to move. Was it some kind of an animal? You okay? Mulder? Is it going to work?   What just happened?     How did he know what he did was going to work? Why would he take that risk? So much for your boyhood hero. Why does she need Belt? It's an oxygen leak.  Even I can figure out what happens when you run out of Where the hell is he? I'm going to go get security. Michelle! I think she's right, Mulder.  You saw him in there.  He's losing it. Did he?  Or did he put their lives in unnecessary jeopardy?  If he can't deliver Look, Mulder.  I think somebody must have sabotaged the space shuttle because What exactly are we looking for?	A needle in a haystack. Mulder, I found it.  This is the same diagram that was sent to Are you saying he might have known about the Challenger defect? Oh my God. He's having some kind of a seizure, Mulder.  Give him 10 milligrams of Diazepam. He's going to hurt himself, Mulder. Mulder, you're risking an anuerysm. You're going to kill him, Mulder. We've got to get him to a hospital. They made it. I just heard. The doctors who examined him said he was experiencing severe dementia. He ordered those x-rays of the damaged parts. While simultaneously trying to kill them? There's an investigation, you know.  They haven't ruled out foul play. J. Edgar Jr? Supervisory? Two years out of the academy, how'd he land that? Well, good for Marty. Brad Wilson told me, the pyshological profile you wrote on the Is that what everyone thinks I do? Mulder's ideas maybe a bit out there but he is a great agent. I take it there's a pattern? What do you mean? Suicides? Bare hands. This looks like an X-file. Do you want me to ask Mulder? They're friends of mine from the academy, I'm sure they just It probably has to do with your reputation. Mulder, look. Colton plays by the book and you don't. We just got here. Er, Fox Mulder, Tom Colton. Ten murders, Colton never mentioned.. Are you saying, these prints are from the 1960's and the 1930's? Of course. You're saying these are copy-cats. Are you suggesting that I go before the Violent Crime Section Well, what then? That, that this is the work of a hundred Look, bottom line, this is Colton's case. Mulder, they don't want you involved. They don't want to hear Position ten, I copy. Mulder, what the hell are you doing here? Mulder, you are jeopardising my stakeout. Position ten requesting backup. Federal Agent, I'm armed. Proceed down the vent, slowly. It still doesn't explain what he was doing there that late at He was crawling up an air duct, by himself, without alerting Tom, I wanna thank you for letting me put in some time with Tom, I can look out for myself. You knew they wouldn't believe you, why did you push it? It seems like you were acting very territorial, I don't know, Er, I don't know, you must have something more than your polygraph How could that be? Tom. We have authorized access to this crime scene. A The victim's. The victim is a Thomas Werner, single, white.. Baltimore PD checked out Tooms' apartment, it was a cover. No Apartment 2 0 3. He killed the guy above him. Well, this must be Tooms' great grandfather. Genetics might explain the patterns, it also might explain the Well, what do you think? 2023. Nope, he disappeared off the face of the earth. You? At least in Baltimore County. No, I did find one thing Sir? Unofficially? A piece of the removed liver? Here's 103. There's nothing here. I don't know. Frank said he collected trophies. It looks like the wall's deteriorating. This looks like the opening, think there's anything inside? No one could live in this. Hibernates? Mulder. In any case, he's not here now and he's gotta come back. Yeah, that'll take some fannagling. Oh, wait, I'm snagged on something, oh, it's ok, I got it. I have to meet Mulder.. It isn't in any way interferring with your investigation. You can't do that. Is this what it takes to climb the ladder Colton? Then I can't wait `til you fall off and land on your ass. Mulder, you must've gone out since Colton gave us the night You'll be interested to know that I've ordered some genetic   Not that I could tell if there was.  Why are all the lights out?    What did you do?    Says who?    Hey, hey, hey.     In the last 48    Did the doctor take your blood?    Well, if you were poisoned, it could have been overlooked.    I know.  But you are.  You still supervise them.    Look, it could've been anything.  It could have been the slightest    And then what?    It wouldn't necessarily leave a mark.  Some poisons are absorbed    Wait a second. Back up.  It can't be.  That's Kenneth Orgel.  An    A physicist.  Very well known, as far as physicists go.    Why would he be coming to see you?    Sir, if this man poisoned you, you should be off your feet and    What hospital was he at?    Yes, you released him from your care earlier this evening.    Well, that's why I'm here.  He may have been poisoned.    I don't know.  In fact, I'm not even sure what I'm looking for.    Is this them in here?    We may not have time.  He may not have time either.    Are you sure these haven't been processed?    How is it working as a poison?    Look at them-- just rattling around in the solution.    Did you just touch something?    It just multiplied.  Look!  It just did it again.    Dr. Plant?    I think I've found it.  I think I found what the carbon's doing.    Where are they taking him?    I know this man.    Look, I'm sorry.  His name is Walter Skinner.  We've been    No, that's not going to save him.  It's his blood.    You're not going to solve anything until you get a scope into him.    It's okay, sir.  Lie back down.  We're just moving you to another    That's what Mulder's trying to figure out right now.  But we're    He's stable, but it's not good, Mulder.  He's got extreme vascular    We don't know what it is.  I mean, the best that we can do is keep    What is this?    Yeah, but this is just a routine procedure, Mulder.  The FBI does    You're saying that Dr. Orgel poisoned Skinner in order to cover up    New technology.    Well, I think I might.    Who is it?    Sir, there's something I'd like to try.  It's a treatment called    Sir?    What do you mean?    Sir, you know that's not true.    You've been our ally more times than I can say.    What?    Try.    He was following you?    Sir, I've spoken with your doctors and your prognosis is excellent.    Sir?  Case number 1-4- dash-3-0-8, Blake McCormick. A well nourished Caucasian male, 24-years-old. I will begin with my external examination.  And here is a likely place to start. Ahhhh! Well for starters, Mr. McCormick was dead before he landed on the car. His skull was pulverized from a previous impact. And judging by the roofing material that I found in the wound, I'd say that Agent Doggett's theory holds water. Electricity. Or maybe electricity is only a by-product. I'm... I'm not really sure. But... look, I had an odd experience today. And, uh, and it made me think to try something unusual. I borrowed an EEG machine, and I wired Mr. McCormick to it. And for the last few hours, he's been putting off a faint reading. No. He's dead as a hammer. Uh... what I'm reading is some sort of residual electricity, like a... like a battery that's draining off its charge.  It's fascinating. I mean, I've never seen anything quite like it. Well, if Mulder were here, I'd, uh, imagine he'd talk about research linking electromagnetic fluctuations to levitation, poltergeist activity, ghost sightings ... At the end of the day, I wouldn't have any theory that was any better. And I don't now. So, the owner won't talk, huh?  Smile. You're on TV. I'm in Los Angeles at the Field Office. I've called in someone whom you'll both want to meet. I went through Mulder's reference books. Van Nuys, California, 1970, one of the best documented cases of what was initially thought to be poltergeist activity. It focused on a young. boy, Anthony Fogelman, who has since changed his name. And Doctor Reits was the parapsychologist who investigated it. He was psychokinetic. He lost his power? A jinx. Cousin Oliver, the Jinx.  Oh, so maybe I watched an episode or two. Uh... so what you're saying is that, uh, his choice speaks to Anthony Fogelman's character. How he views himself. Um, unlucky, star-crossed, a danger. Well, I'm starting to hope that it doesn't come to that. Well, the power that this man seemingly possesses is extraordinary. It needs to be studied. It very well could. I mean, I've... I've been working this unit for nine years now. I-I've investigated nearly 200 paranormal cases. We are due for some incontrovertible proof. I want vindication, for ... for Mulder and ... for all of us. Just minor bruising. Oliver. It's a great pleasure to meet you. Can you think about other things?  What happens if you think about another place? A nice place? Oh, my god. Oliver? With your help, we could learn so much. I would love to take you back with us to Washington. Well, I think that's where we can help him. I mean, he needs to learn how to control his powers. I mean, my God. There's no end to what he could accomplish. And besides, I mean... as grand as this may sound, we owe it to the world. So, what do you think, Dr. Jaycocks? He's having a seizure. What happened? Oliver's electrolytes were severely imbalanced. That's what sent him into shock. They've stabilized his fluids. Well, there's other problems. His thyroid level is elevated, his glucose is low, CPK liver enzymes and BUN, they're all elevated. It points to a multi-system organ failure. Gradually, his body is consuming itself. It's been going on for months, and ... maybe even years. His doctors have no idea, but I think I'm starting to. And if so, it follows that the more he uses it, the more his health will decline ... until finally ... Oh, my God. Why goodbye, Oliver? Well, they're trying everything they can think of. Experimental drugs, plasma transfusion. They're the, uh, perfect family. And since Oliver didn't have one as a child, he ... created one. Well, what are you suggesting is the course of action, John? Me too. Well, maybe I've had it these past nine years. If not proof of the paranormal, then ... of more important things. They've identified it as 9mm pistol ammunition, teflon-coated armour-piercing. Single round. He was shot, there's no doubt about that. Yeah. Well, what do we know about the victim? He was right. Looks to have entered through the top of his head. Hi. What's directly above this? He didn't make it from here. Can I use your pencil? Captain!  We're going to need your crime scene investigators up here. Very. But this victim here stated that he was going to be killed just moments before he was shot, which doesn't sound lucky at all. What have you got there? Well, there's thermal imaging technology which can pick up body heat through walls. Maybe that's what allowed him to aim. Chase ran it on foot. He said that somebody was after him. This is probably where it all started.  Oh. CHASE did a lot of business with an exterminating company called Triple-A-1 Surekill. Six jobs in one month.  I think Carlton Chase did this. Unless it was someone outside. Well, it's precision marksmanship, that's for sure. These holes line up perfectly with the three victims behind there, which tells me that the shooter was standing right here behind this wall. Unless he could see. The light our eyes can register is only one small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Other wavelengths from infra-red to gamma have other properties. X-rays, for instance, can pass through solid objects. I am *remarking* that these wavelengths exist and the only thing that is stopping us from seeing them, if you will, is the biochemical structure of our eyes. I am *conjecturing* that if this structure was somehow different we'd have the ability to see things that we don't. OK, so you explain it. Which is? And how does a dead real estate agent figure into that? Hello? It's an insecticide used only by licensed exterminators. 8
34p.m. We found a call to your office billed on Mr. Chase's calling card. It was made from a payphone not far from where he was murdered. For Grand Theft Auto. I assume he had a partner doing the driving. They share the same birthday.  They're twins. Well, maybe there's someone in that office who will. I wouldn't be so sure. Can you explain these, Mr. Cooper? OK Randall? Let's talk about your exterminating company. There's just the three of you, right? You and your brother and Tammi Peyton? So, how is it that your little company billed over $700,000 to Chase Realty last year? Seven hundred thousand. That's a lot of dead rats. I think that you and your brother and Carlton Chase were in a whole other business together. Randall? Is that what your brother just said to Agent Doggett?  You know why I said that, don't you? Because somehow you can see through that wall. You can see your brother behind me and you can read his lips. I don't know what gives you the ability but I know how you use it. You shoot drug dealers from places where they can't see you and then you and Dwight rob them. That's how you make all that money, isn't it? Yeah. You certainly are. And talking to you now, I think that the whole thing is Dwight's idea. It's time to be your own man, Randall. It's time to think for yourself. Look. Here's where I get confused and I am hoping that you can help me out. Carlton Chase. Unless the reason wasn't business.  Unless it was personal. Calls to Carlton Chase. So Dwight Cooper learns that something's going on between his girl friend and Carlton Chase. Maybe not. Maybe Dwight's not the one who's jealous. Clothes are gone. Tammi left in a hurry. Maybe she thought someone was after her. You think she planned to go? Who are you calling? No. A County DA came in and he declined representation. Aside from that, he's been uncommunicative. Cause of death was massive head trauma, pronounced on site. Says here in the police report they'd been seen arguing Between that and the bus driver's statement, why am I That's his alibi, that some old man came and warned him What was he wearing, a long black robe and carrying He was arrested? Has anybody talked to him? Has anybody talked to the campus security officer? Why not? Of what? You mean, with the autopsy? Hypothermic? Mulder, this man's an icicle. Did you And now, his body temperature is 8 degrees. I think we're gonna need some time ourselves. Well, my best guess would be that he's been exposed to I don't know what else to say, Mulder, except that what this What if he can't? Has Nichols said anything? Well, I think we may be filing a second murder charge I found Nichols' right thumbprint on his uniform, and What did he say? Sounds like Jason Nichols has an accomplice. More than that, Mulder, it makes sense. Science is a He's a cryobiologist. He freezes things for a living. I want to show you something. (she hands him a folder Well, no one at the lab would even hazard a guess, You'll have to ask Jason Nichols. I'm Agent Scully. May I show you something? You recognize it?  Lisa, you can A catalyst for what? This compound ... has Jason actually tested it yet? Is it possible that he could have synthesized the compound Traces of the compound were detected in a man who was And a, uh, a Dr. Yonechi was also found frozen to death. Just over two hours ago. Why is that relevant? This isn't gonna work. His body temperature was 8 degrees. The lowest reported Don't try and talk right now. We've inserted a tube down Oh my God. He's on fire. He's having febrile siezures. Lisa, what happened? What, what could have happened So raising his body temperature may have catalyzed an What did he say? But he just let you go?  Lisa, if you're leaving But there are people who could have figured it out - You know who this old man is, don't you? But Jason does. He has to, because this man is doing If he'd lie for you, what makes you think he wouldn't lie Because it's not just her secret. It's Jason's secret, too,  I suppose it is an unlikely choice as a murder Are you sure this is the room? I'm not sure if 'living' is a word I'd use on this place. Yonechi's flight information was taken down on this pad. When was this taken? It's a celebration, but of what? What?  What? And if your sister is your aunt and your mother marries OK, so this photo that was never taken, when was it Mulder, the compound already exists. Back from where? You're seriously suggesting that this old man is back So what you're saying here is the old man is ... I know what I wrote, Mulder. I also know that the laws of How? Get her back in the tub. Now. How hot's the reading now? We've resuscitated her, Mulder. Her body temperature is He's not here. Where are you? Mulder? Lisa? It's Dana Scully, can you hear me?  The old man?  Look, there's been some Lisa, Jason's dead. There was a fire in the mainframe room. You find the second corpse? We should put out an APB on the old man. Even if it can never be proven? I was 23 when I wrote that. The map says to turn right at the intersection. At the intersection? This isn’t a stoplight, it’s a stop sign. A turn right. Based on what evidence? And you have physical evidence of these rituals being conducted? So you have nothing concrete to connect these things to Satanists.  Our research has proven that most of these accounts Who interviewed them? Together or separate? Well, then you have no way of determining whether or not the Let me guess, they told you about a wild beast entering in on Where is she going? I doubt she’s even a blonde. Yeah, could you tell me again exactly what happened the night How did you know they were up to no good? I don’t suppose there have been any actual reports of stolen The problem is, that the details of these accounts could have There have been incidents where the embalming fluid used to What’s what? A horned beast? I think you guys are seeing something that isn’t there. No, I don’t see the horns right there.  Sure, fine.  Whatever. What happened?  You weren’t in your motel room. I see.

That’s right, her friend just gave us a statement. Who? Well, actually I’m way ahead of you, Mulder, because I’m with I’ve got your suspect and you’ve got mine. Why does that make  Sure, fine, whatever.  What the hell is going on here? Gladly.  You ready?    Shut up, Mulder. Where are the wounded? I'm FBI, where are the people who were shot? Excuse me, I'm Special Agent Scully, FBI.  I wanna talk What did you see? You were shot? What man? What did he do? Who? He's gone.

Your mother is at the.. Well there could be several reasons huh..but to be honest, I I'm sure it can, and will be Mulder, I'm gonna drive you to To do what? Did they get anything on the man on question? Whoa what happened there? Yeah.. Could that be another detective? Where are you going? Mulder you haven't slept in almost 24 hours. Sir? Excuse me but..

Mulder, he knows about your sister. But how? There’s not much traffic at this hour. Only what I’ve read in the Herald. Uh, that four young What happened last night? How was he killed? Has a cause of death been determined. I’m sorry, I thought you said that Owen Sanders was black. I’m not sure I follow. I assume you’re going somewhere with this. So you don’t think these men are victims of a crime at all. Case number 2139318537. Subject is a black male, 19 years His name was Owen Sanders. He was reported as the fourth  I have been requested to determine what leeched The Centers for Disease Control. Well, they believe that the uh, the case has been mislabeled. There were no external signs of trauma or defense wounds and I don’t know. There are conditions like vitiligo which Well, it’s very possible that they have already turned up but I’m sorry? Mulder, not everything is a labyrinth of dark conspiracy, and  Yes, there’s hair, skin, and fiber behind you on the counter.  If I’m correct, it’s a cortical depressant that  In large enough quantities it  No, the tox screen was clean.  Only if the victim hadn’t expired immediately.  No, but .... I think I found something that  The pituitary gland secretes all the regulatory  No. I have identified the effect.  Where are you, Mulder? You mean he looked sick? Did you observe anybody else in the area? Excuse me. We have another missing young man. His name is Alfred He works at a fast food place down the street. He takes What are you suggesting? What makes you so sure? It says here that the cause of death was undetermined. Sir, we’re not here to arrest anybody. Yes. Investigating a possible public health crisis.  It has to be here, Mulder. The motive of any pathogen is to reproduce itself. And Death is a health crisis. Something caused Owen Sanders’ He’s not here. Mulder, I think I know where he went. (Indicates hole Oh, my god.

Well, however he’s managed to survive wha --- I mean what.... So you’re basing this theory on a folktale? Well, even if you’re right, I mean especially if you’re right, What are you doing?

Sharon, we believe that there are things that you haven't told About Max. About where he's been, about where he's traveled, No, but we found a passenger with severe burns, severe cellular We need to know what that was, Sharon. If you're withholding Mulder... Paul Gidney. It's an alias that Max Fenig used in his letters Mulder, the burns on that passenger's face were deep tissue I don't know.

And the I.I.C. is making a statement to the press, saying that No, not yet, but they are taking a careful look at the emergency Mulder, why can't you just accept the facts? What would you like them to report? Are you accusing these men of covering evidence? They were already out here? Then what did you do? We've been traveling a long way. Yeah, that must have come after our briefing. Excuse me? We'll take care of it. I haven't a clue. You think Max's sister was... About what caused the crash? From what? Sounds like what you're describing is physically impossible. Scully. Mulder, we've been up for over thirty-six hours, can't it wait... I'm on my way. This is Louis Frish, Sergeant Frish. He's the air-traffic controller Somebody would have spotted it. Then somebody has to get him someplace safe. Mulder. Mulder... In Great Sacandaga Lake? By myself? You just let me know what's going on, Mulder. I'm just going to get some things. I'm going to ask for some kind of protective arrangement. For what? You didn't bring that plane down, Louis. It wasn't your fault. Look, I can't tell you how to feel, Louis, but I can tell you Yeah, um... just tell her you're okay. We're going to be met here by a federal marshall.

As I understand it, Roosevelt disappeared under But that’s not what you believe. Have there ever been any death threats? Did you know Craig Horning? Did he have any warning that this could happen? Are you aware that a letter of protest was sent to the This one was written by a man named Alonzo Bilac. Is he still with the project? Why is that? Dr. Bilac?  We’re with the FBI. We’re investigating May we ask you some questions? Dr. Bilac, you were part of the expedition that brought back Mona Wustner. But you were Dr. Roosevelt's liaison in Ecuador. At what Did you express that to him? Were you speaking for yourself or for the Indians? Well, apparently, they’ve learned something from you too. Dr. Lewton believes that the protest over the Amaru urn What do you think happened to him? Let me ask you, Dr. Bilac. How far would you go to defend Can you account for your whereabouts last night? You mean the kind who would kill for their cause? No. I think he's *the* suspect. Based on the arrogance of his politics, on his rift with Maybe because he was up late murdering Craig Horning. Craig Horning's blood. What do you think he did with him? You think Bilac's innocent? That the victim wasn't even Label that.  Partial rat body part. Excuse me Can I have a word with you? You were Did you notice anything out of the ordinary? Was he Did he say anything to you about Dr. Bilac? Do you have any idea when the two of them last spoke  I'm going to give you my card. Call me if Mulder… No. They've been over the entire museum grounds. Well, they determined that the hood release had been I don’t think so, Mulder. We found evidence of at least two mutilated rat bodies Apparently, the museum has always had a rat problem. You know, Mulder, there's hardly a thing about these Somewhere between 9
30 and midnight when the guard What’s the connection? I think Mona Wustner might know something. Well, she seemed to get nervous when I asked her about I don’t think so, Mulder. Well, it's human. Small intestine. There's about four Yeah, by what he had for lunch. Corn chowder. It looks What I can't determine how the body was eviscerated. But I can't determine that, either, because there was Well, by the size of the bite marks, a small animal, Yep.  Scully? …. Slow down, Mona.  What happened, Mona?  Where is he now?  I want you to stay exactly where you are. Dr. Bilac?  Mulder, it’s me. Did you find Mona?  No. He’s not here either. But I found his  These are all recent.  Why?  Mulder, I think Bilac’s been tripping. I  I think he's been praying to the Amaru  It looks like he's invoking the curse, Mulder.  Did you find Mona? Where is she? You told Agent Mulder that she was dead. You must Then why do you have blood on your clothes? She said she was scared. She said that you became Maybe you were too high to know the difference. I’m going to ask you one more time, Dr, Bilac, where  That man stays in I just assumed that one of the toilets had overflowed. There's only one way to find out. How did they get in there. Mona Wustner? What did you find? Warfarin? The dog ate a cat. The cat ate a rat. Yeah. Significant of what? It’s an old building, Mulder. They have a rat problem. Yaje. So, what are we talking here, Mulder, a possessed rat? From something that sent them diving into the toilet. Have *you* been drinking Yaje, Mulder? What? How’s that possible? Did you step away from this door at any time? And no one entered this room? Are there any other doors or windows in this room? You didn’t hear anything? I want you to search the entire building beginning with Where does it lead to? You think Bilac crawled down there?  The system looks like it branches And one way out.  To the left, it looks like. We should be directly under the museum here.  What is it? Oh, my God. It’s Dr. Lewton. It looks like his eyes What is it? You think that cat killed those people? No, Mulder, this way. There’s a room here with a vent. It’s Bilac. Yeah. Well, the search team's on their way back up. Animal control is still looking. So far, they haven't found No one’s denying that, Mulder, it’s just that there are miles What are you talking about? What for? The curse? Are they going to send back the bones?    I can think of a neater one.  How you convinced me to drop everything and get on the first    Yeah, I saw the picture.  And as for this Amazing Maleeni turning his head all the way around,      But... I'd guess this event was completely removed from the subsequent    Don't you?    Mulder, his head was cut off.    Why are you talking like Tony Randall?    Mulder, I admit that I don't know how it happened but I still say that it was a murder.  So    Who's the heckler?    Hang on a second.  Let me see this.  That heckler was pretty hard to impress wouldn't you say?    Well, it's worth checking out, don't you think?    Ah, but observe.  His discarded soda cup.  The hand may be quicker than the eye but it still    Skeptic.    Mr. LaBonge?  We're Agents Mulder and Scully from the FBI.    Were you at the, uh, Santa Monica Pier yesterday morning?    He's dead, under extremely suspicious circumstances.    Your fingerprints.  You have a criminal record.    Well, you're on videotape heckling the deceased.    No.    Yeah.    Well, thank you, Mr. LaBonge.  We'll, uh... be in touch.    Mulder, I think that professional jealousy is as good a motive for murder as any.    If I can get Mr. Maleeni into an autopsy bay hopefully we can put this issue to a rest as soon as    All right, I'm stumped... and I think I'm supposed to be.    Well, first of all, and sorry to disappoint you but, uh, Mr. Maleeni's head didn't just magically    Spirit gum, Mulder.  It held the head to the body.  Just barely, of course.    Well, no.  As far as I can tell this man died of advanced coronary disease.    Yeah.    No.  Which makes it even stranger still because, as far as I can tell this body has been dead for    Well, somebody performed yesterday.    He certainly does.    He might try and run.    No.  We are investigating the death of a magician who called himself the Amazing Maleeni.    Yes, we know.  We checked his next of kin.    Do you know magic, Mr. Pinchbeck?    No kidding.  What now?    Why do people do magic?  To, uh, impress, to delight to gain attention.    Well, maybe we should consult an expert.  Someone who knows magic, who's seen the    Yeah.    The feeling of pride that comes from performing your civic duty.     It would seem not.    Not even you, I guess.    Thanks for your expert opinion.  I guess we're right back where we started.    What would this be doing in Maleeni's van?    It's your handwriting, is it not?  Mr. Alvarez please answer the question.    We ran it through the California criminal history database to which you seem to be quite well    In Herman Pinchbeck's van.  Where were you last Thursday?       Don't leave town, Mr. Alvarez.    Maybe he wasn't so adept.  LaBonge certainly doesn't have a high opinion of his skills.    It's in your right hand.       Ah...  That's not bad.        Mulder...       Ah-choo.      Amazing!    And what's the point?    And that's what's happening in this case?    By whom?  Maleeni is already dead.    We'd like to have a word with you, Mr. Pinchbeck.       Mulder?!    You're Maleeni?    We know.  Gambling debts to a man named Alvarez.    So why'd you play poker with him?    Well, why did you lose?  You could have manipulated the cards, right?    Well, you could, right?    Well, sir... what does any of this have to do with your twin brother being found decapitated at    You found him dead of a heart attack.    And so you refrigerated the body...    And you posed as an amputee to allay suspicion that you weren't your brother.    You, uh, still haven't explained why you left your brother's body at the pier or why you    What are you looking for, Mulder?    Mulder, it says here something about a robbery attempt yesterday.       Yeah, well, Mr. Pinchbeck was the employee who signed out the    Maybe, maybe not.       Yes... Okay. All right … All right, thank you.    He's still in the city lockup where he's been since we arrested him last night.  It certainly    Yeah.    Does it?    Cissy Alvarez.  Convicted bank robber.    Well... saving up for a rainy day?    Billy LaBonge.    I think releasing these two may be a bit premature.    Last night the Cradock Marine Bank was robbed of $1.8 million.  This morning that entire    He'll need a good lawyer.    That's what you wanted us to think.    It was a setup from the start.  You played poker with him and you made sure that you lost big.    LaBonge planted Alvarez's marker in Maleeni's van and made sure we found it …  (Flashback    And then last night the two of you robbed the bank, and planted the money at ALVAREZ's    With your expertise at sleight of hand, pick pocketing, and escapology I think you were both    We saw through their magic.      You picked his pocket?    What are you talking about?    We were the last piece of the puzzle.    You know, Mulder, there's still one thing that you haven't explained.    How the Amazing Maleeni was able to turn his head completely around.    I do.  I'll show you.  Observe.    Well... magic. Mulder, I was hoping it wouldn't come up. Mulder, let me remind you once again... Mulder, yes there is a scientific basis for what happened It attacks and destroys human cells but that is all it does, Mulder, I just want to remind you that by not informing What are they? With what kind of weapon? His bare hands? Mulder, this is hardwood. This kind of gouging didn't happen with anybody's bare Is it animal? So the attacker never left.  Mulder... Mulder, given the scenario that you just described, the Mulder, there isn't anything in the animal kingdom capable Mulder, that doesn't mean that I can just accept your theory. Mulder, I know what you did. I know what happened to me We received a call that a man was killed here.  Let's get out of here, Mulder. You weren't getting anywhere, Mulder. How do they know? Mulder, how do you know? Oh, my God. Gibson. Sorry, sweetie. Gibson?  No. No, you've been worked on by some They should have changed your bandages, Gibson. Communicate with what? Mulder, this kid belongs in a hospital. Mulder, you can't just take him on some snipe hunt. No, but what if he could corroborate everything that you're Mulder, what's going on? Where are you going? You're going to be fine, Gibson. You're going to be okay. We're going to get you well.  We have to run some more tests, Gibson. You're a very special boy, Gibson. You know that yourself.  Mulder, I found something. I found something  We did blood tests on Gibson and, Mulder,  I'm almost positive.  I don't know … I don't know, but I think we're  What? There was a little boy in that room and he's gone. That little boy that I brought in is missing. He's not here!  Everything WE were told, Mulder. You know, Agent Fowley's report to OPR painted the facts Mulder, Agent Fowley's report states that the man you I don't doubt what you saw, Mulder. I don't doubt you. I'm asking you to trust my judgment. To trust me. Mulder, these are test results. DNA from the claw nail we Which matches exactly DNA that was found in Gibson Praise. No. It's a part of his DNA. In fact, it's a part of all of our It would mean that all of us are. What happened? Where is he? Where's Agent Mulder? In the trunk. I don't have it! Agent Mulder. I've told you everything I know. To the best of my knowledge, Who are these people? What they're doing is putting an official stamp on the perpetuation What about the people who were poisoning Agent Mulder's water? The investigation will be an exercise! The men who killed Agent With all due respect, sir, I think you overestimate your position Hi, mom. They, uh, they started to give me blisters s, so... Oh, mom... I've made a terrible mistake. Dad would be so ashamed of me. Frohike? How much have you had to drink? Uh, I'm afraid not. I'm soon to be out of a job. And like rats, they just scatter back into the woodpile. What's this? "Kenneth J. Soona was killed execution style in what appears For now. No. It's okay. Thank you. Yes, sir. I came across a news article. A man's body was found The date of death postdates Agent Mulder's disappearance. Now, Well, if both men were killed by the same weapon, we could prove Yes, I know that, sir. I just thought this might be helpful. You don't want to check? I was just trying to cooperate with your investigation, sir. No. I just want answers. I don't have it. I believe so. Is that all, sir? I'm just curious about something, would you mind if I went through Would you mind running the wand over me one more time? No, not today. What do you think it could be? I don't know how it could have gotten there. Yeah. It looks like a computer chip. I don't even know how long its been in there. I have absolutely I don't have access to the F.B.I. labs. Hmmm... Melissa... No! I was afraid... Um... that I would die... There were men... um, a man took me and, uh... there was a light I'm trying. The, the sound is all screwed up. There was an alarm. I don't know. I had to trust someone... I was powerless. I couldn't... I could No! You came to see me today. You came to my apartment, I assumed you wanted to see me about I saw you come out of my building. Mrs. Mulder? I'm Dana Scully, I work with your son. I think he's still alive. I just have a very strong feeling. About? Who are you? What kind of interests? Threatened enough to murder? What do you know about Mulder? You're lying. What are you here for? Leave me alone. You said there were two ways. Why, why kill me? Why are you protecting me? You're not protecting me, you're protecting yourself. What kind of business are you in? Hello? Hi. I, uh, I had to go to Boston... for a funeral. Why? Missy, something strange happened to me today. I'm... I'm a Yeah, yeah, I will. Bye. Hi. Missy, it's me. Please pick up. I was just going over to my sister's. Where are we going? After you. Take two steps forward. I know why you're here. I want to know who sent you. Whose errand You got the rest of your life to give me answers. How high does it go, Skinner? Who's pulling the strings? What's the alternative? Let you kill me now? You're lying. How? And did the inquest come up with anything unusual? Did you learn about wind in kindergarten? Pulled? By whom? So you're saying that, uh, a ghost killed Teddy Holvey. Mulder, this information is the same reason why you'll see a I've seen some pretty slippery two-year-olds. Mrs. Holvey, at the time of the accident, did you have any What is she saying? Sure, it's a swastika. You're right. I saw her drawing it. Well, I think this boy needs as much protection as he can get It's when a parent or caretaker brings harm to a child by Each time they were unable to determine the cause of the Well, the family moved around a lot because of Steve's job, Since his brother was born, which is right when Holvey's And you suspect Golda? Are you familiar with Munchausen by Proxy? Teddy's medical records have raised some questions. I'd like to interview your son Charlie, Mr. Holvey, but with What was that? Mulder! Find anything? Looks like ash. The Holveys said earlier that they had some problems with the Well, what do you think it is? Well, before we do anything, I think we should get Charlie Not when a child is in danger ... and not after they see two Without a doubt.  What did What? What do you mean? Where are we going? India? Wait a second. Nothing just materializes out of thin air. Yeah, but that was a parable. Too bad you didn't take a picture. You could have run it Yeah, that or somebody activated the remote control. Well, who was standing outside when the garage door opened He says he doesn't remember anything. Now, the coroner's What is it? You think this was a ritual killing? Protection against what? Mrs. Holvey? What did he say? Punish you for what? I think we should talk to Charlie and find out what happened Mrs. Holvey? Don't restrain him. Let's turn him on his side so he doesn't He's resting. How's Mrs. Holvey? The doctor said that Charlie had some kind of a siezure, Is that Mrs. Holvey? There. I think she's got Charlie with her.  Nurse! Who? Charlie? Why? You're saying Mrs. Holvey left here with a ghost? But, Mulder ... What are you gonna do? Mrs. Holvey? Hello? Charlie? Are you all right? We're OK. How's Charlie?  Mulder … what are you doing? How long have you been with the Bureau, Agent Fowley? And they brought you on this because of a terrorism 1991.  That’s about when you started work on  Your parents are going Mulder …  What was that all Mulder, he’s recognized internationally as a prodigy. Mulder, he was goofing on you. He was playing We have seen cases, Mulder, of fakers and lucky Who? Who are you talking about? Say that what you’re suggesting were even possible, So, you two know each other? How you doing? Hmm … They’re a little scary, aren’t they? About what? About you? It’s amazing. It’s hard to believe. Where’d you see that?  I have to disappear  Is somebody going to let me in? Thank you. I need your help. You’ve all heard of Gibson Praise the chess wunderkind. Well, apparently, he wins by reading his opponents’ Analyze the data … with an eye to the parapsychological.  Then you know her. Well, she claims to have worked closely with him Well … Why don’t you boys see what you can find?  Mulder, it’s me.  I’m, uh, I’m on my  Uh, no, I’d ... I’d  I think you’ll be surprised.  I’ve Neurological tests. Mapping of brain functions The tests revealed something peculiar in an area All of the boy’s brain processes are showing extraordinary You mischaracterize what I’ve said. This would Gibson? I’d like to ask you something. How do you do it? Is that why you like chess? ‘Cause it’s just Why else do you like it?  Is that what people do? Why? You think I don’t care?  Well, we’ll talk about this later,  Nobody’s going to do anything to What about the boy? Is he here?  We knew there were risks going  Yes, sir.  I understand.  Yes, I’m - I’m here with  I’ll communicate that to  Right. Well, I’ll be  They have her on maximum There are talks going on right now about reassignment. Both of us. These talks included instructions  Mulder, whatever you may believe, Mulder, you've been through this tape a hundred times. What And all he told you to was to watch channel eight? Do we even know why the suspect was being chased? Well, that ought to put him in the Ten Most Wanted list. How do you know he's not just yanking your chain, this Deep Well, he has lied to you by his own admission. Then what are you missing? The report says that the car was registered to a rental agency What? It's not the same car. It's called a caduceus. It's sort of the adopted symbol of the Mm-hmmm.  Fast-forward. Why would they do that? I'm sorry, I thought they were friendly. No, but he tried to. No. I mean, this has reached the point of absurdity, Mulder. We're That's all he's given us. Who is this Deep Throat character? You don't know that this isn't just a game with him. He's toying No. I think he does it because you do. The county sheriff's office is conducting the investigation. Yeah, they think that for whatever reason, he trashed his lab Well, it says he tied one end of a roll of medical gauze around Nope. I know, that gauze is troubling. Ummm... "Terrence Allen Berube. Harvard Med., 1974." He was Right, but there's nothing extraordinary about that. I mean, I'm sorry, Mulder. I'm seeing the pieces but I'm not seeing I don't know. What are you going to do? Okay, Mulder, but I'm warning you... if this is monkey pee, It was recovered at a crime scene. No, I'm expecting it to turn out to be nothing. What are they? How do you mean? You have no way of identifying them? No, no, I'll wait. It's me. Who? Where is he now? I'm at the Georgetown Microbiology Department. Much. And it's not silver, it's green. Some kind of bacteria, each containing virus and it looks as Well, the only reason why you clone a virus inside a bacteria... Yeah, they're just about to run some primary cell cultures and Oh, Doctor Carpenter. I fell asleep. Yeah, I think those are genes. Why is that? What exactly did you find? Mulder? Where on God's earth have you been? I've been trying Mulder... that bacteria I had analyzed... they're saying that What? Wait a second... Mulder? No, um... if you'd had listened to me, we wouldn't be here right You know, I've always held science as sacred. I've, I've always What happened to them? Were those the same men who killed Doctor Berube? Why? What was he running from? There's just one thing I don't understand. Why you gave us so I'm going to get back to Georgetown and get all the lab work. Where? Excuse me? I'm looking for Doctor Ann Carpenter. I've been unable Where is he? He's been gone all night. Something's happened to him. How do you know that? I don't have any evidence. They took the evidence and they may Where? Inside where? What do they have there? Dana Scully. Federal government. Purity control. You're late. Yes. You spoke to them? No, sir. I'll make the exchange. I don't trust you. I don't know who you are. I know nothing about you. So why give it back to them? At the risk of so many other lives? No! Hello? Where are you? What? Who said that? Mulder... Well, you have to lodge a protest. They can't... What are you going to do? He's somewhere here on the compound. We have to find him. Where haven't we covered? Mulder. Mulder! How did you know that? We believe that Ephesian is a paranoid charismatic sociopath. Vernon, if Sidney was unfaithful, did he receive a "crown of Skinner said no one else has come up with anything. As you can Melissa, do you understand your right to have an attorney present What about your family, where do they live? How long have you lived there? How long have you been married to Ephesian? That's quite a faith you have in Vernon there, Melissa. I'd Have you ever witnessed any child abuse at the temple, Melissa? Melissa? You're claiming Sidney is her past life just because she mentioned Melissa Riedal is not cooperating. They're extremely rare. I believe the disorder exists, but in this case, under these Yes, but we are responsible for Melissa Riedal. You didn't even have the courage to tell Skinner what you really I don't believe that you feel responsible for those fifty lives... We know that events occurred here that, uh, that may be painful. What should I call you? Lily... were any of your friends hurt in this room? Melissa, Lily... it's okay to tell me. What's wrong? That's why they weren't on the A.T.F. reports. Who are you calling? Because hypnosis is used in the treatment of dissociative identities No, it's about regressing her to a past life. And why is it that Vernon Ephesian is, reported by you, a paranoid Maybe there's a map of the battlefield down in the records. Mulder... Mulder, this is a product of her illness. She couldn't answer Mulder, Ephesian's arraignment is in two hours. There is no Mulder, it's Scully. Do you see any bunkers in the field? Ephesian's being taken down to his arraignment. He and Melissa Even if I knew for certain, I wouldn't change a day. I've reported to investigators on the site about the possible It's not the property of the Seven Stars, so the B.A.T.F. is Revelations tells of Christian faith defeating that army.

Organized crime.  The Bureau's been trying to build a racketeering    Ouch.    Mulder, you keep saying "this man."  Who is this man?    Was this basement thoroughly searched?    And your theory is?    So, basically, what if we were looking for Wile E. Coyote?    You know in 1998, there was a British soldier who plummeted    My point is that if there's a wind gust, or a sudden updraft and,    I don't know.    Mulder?    Look at this.  If this cart were on the platform when he hit, that    Yeah, we have to find him.    I think you're taking a flier here, Mulder.   There's got to be at    Maybe he can't see his way to the door.    Ma'am, we're not plumbers.    You okay, Mulder?    Mr. Weems, why were you hiding in a vacant apartment?    Avoiding whom?    Last night, Cutrona had you thrown off the roof of 1107 Hunter    You got lucky?    So that's what you were doing there last night--  playing poker?    Mr. Weems, can I ask you to reconsider testifying against Cutrona?    Well, it would be in your best interest.  He's tried to kill you  So, here's the plan, as I see it

So, uh, we've searched the entire building and there's no sign of    You think that Weems could have killed him in self-defense?    What the hell happened here, Mulder?    Meaning...?    Dumb luck?    Hang on a second.      Hey. Your name's Richie, right?    I'm Dana.       Why don't we,    So I'm guessing you're a sports fan.  Which one's your favorite?    I like baseball, too.

Mulder, as to your theory...    Why would the world's most supernaturally lucky man work      That's it? ... Got nothing else.  Okay. Thank you.    He has no record of any kind, Mulder.  He doesn't earn    Henry.    13?    More good luck, you're saying?    Mulder, there are millions of reasons for that including    So, let me get this straight.  This is the man who initially won    And once you and he ascertained that the accident victim was    Afterwards, the man who was hit by the truck handed you the      Mm-hmm.  Thank you, Mr. Albert.  I think that will    For such a fortunate man a lot of unfortunate things happen in    So, Mulder, Henry Weems came here to buy a lottery ticket.  Why?    Well, he's not in his place and he's not with Richie.    Pretty damn well, I'd say.  That thing must go all over the    I haven't a clue.    Mulder, what does that prove?    For Richie, right?    CMV negative.  Cytomegalovirus.    However, you will need protection from Cutrona and his men.    I'm sorry, Mulder.  That was utterly irresponsible. You're feeding        Mulder, you're putting an astounding amount of faith in    Luckiest man in the world?  Hell, Mulder, I just beat him. Mulder?    Well, he's got a bruised rib and a black eye.

Well, I'm armed, so I'll take my chances. It's not exactly as if you've ever tried to fit into the program. The bureau? Y, you could request a transfer to Quantico. Come back to the Wh, what about this case you're working on? Where's the body? Maybe I can request to do the autopsy. There's a dead body, isn't there? Examination and autopsy of John Doe number one-zero-one-three-five-six. Mulder, it's me. I need to see you, I've got something here Some kind of parasite near John Doe. I'm having it looked at, Close the door. Apparently, it had attached itself to the bile duct and was Believe it or not, something like forty million people are infected Well, maybe you'd rather hear what you can catch from a nice, Flukes are endemic in unsanitary conditions. It's more likely I don't know. According to my sources, it's unlikely that a They have what's called a scolex... it's a sucker-like mouth Where'd you get that? And you're asking me if this is from a fluke? M, Mulder, the scolex is a tiny little organ. This is a huge Mulder, I... No. Excuse me? I didn't talk to anybody. Look, Mulder, I... I don't know what to say, but I, I, I wouldn't The turbellarian flatworms are free-living carnivorous scavengers, Yeah. I don't see it. Oh my God. Platyhelminthis are often hermaphroditic.

Well, you're not going to like what I have to tell you? It hadn't occurred to me, but I think that the fluke in the It's looking for hosts. It attacks because the victims' bodies If it finds a new host... Is this seat taken? I'll take my chances. That came from Skinner?

What's gonna happen when word of this gets back to the I'm talking about this Jersey Devil thing. Hyeah, I'll say. Mulder, listen to yourself. You're already ascribing You saw something, I'll give you that but I'm not about Yeah well, I have got to get back to Washington by 7

That's what they say. Yeah. I don't think it's a case we should discuss over dinner. Eef-hhmmm.  Sorry. Mulder. That's ok, what's up? I'm afraid we may have called you down here for nothing. Maybe, she spends her day shopping. Mulder, we've put men into space, we've built computers No I was just, thinking about my godson's birthday party, Mulder? Mulder where are you? Mulder? Lay back.

Oh hi. A guy. Same guy. I don't think so. Not at this time. I'm going with you to the Smithsonian. Keep that up Mulder and I'll hurt you like that beast-woman. Look who's holding the door. He was put to death in the electric chair three days ago. Third time's a charm. What's your interest in this? Well, reincarnation has always been popular on death row for What do you mean? Has a cause of death been determined? I see the guards here wear panic devices. Was the victim's What do you mean? Warden? The body. I think you should take a look. I suggest you get Would it be possible to see the cell where the guard was Did you know Neech Manley? What was he like? How is that? Who do you think killed the guard? Are you afraid at all? Who are you? I was just looking around. Mulder. I'm ready to go now. Guard! I'm just ready to get out of here. What did your preliminary exam turn up? From the eyewitness reports, there were already fly larvae In the anaerobic environment inside the paint can? Hmmm. What was determined to be the cause of that death? Well, what if it saves three lives? Isn't that a deal worth These aren't prisoners. These are guards you've got being I guess you'll be able to finish up that autopsy now, Scully. He had quite a library. Looks like Neech Manley knew his Bible. What's that from? Being obsessed with it doesn't mean you can do it. Like what? The secret password? I'm sorry, Mulder, that's not what I learned in catechism. Do you honestly believe that Neech Manley came back from A very good one, and one much more believable. Or guards. I only get five? Because of his beliefs? Did you catch her body language? Of what? That her husband's gonna keep his word? You mean she thinks she's on the list?  Scully. We're on our way.   Roque.

I hadn't reported it but that same guard also cornered Well, does it make sense to you that Parmelly is Neech's Well, according to an attorney we spoke to, he had A man named Charez.  You know him? Well, he could be the fifth victim. She's got a gun on Parmelly. Center room, facing away. Put it down! Put it down! Why are we stopping? What? I thought we already went through this. Then he was working with someone. They just haven't found To use fear as leverage for Roque's deal with the warden. I don't know. Maybe Parmelly wasn't sticking with the Well then, who did? Neech Manley? It's over, Mulder. Let's just go home.  There. What’s he looking at? Mulder, he’s watching you. What just happened? What’s happening? I can’t see anything! There’s … There he is! He’s heading west. He’s What? What! What? What are you seeing? What? Where’s Mulder? Mulder, respond! I can’t see a thing. Mulder, suspect is armed Mulder! Damn it! What happened? What do you mean? I came in early. I wanted to take a look at the surveillance There were 12 agents yesterday in the park. It’s on the video, Mulder. I can’t prove it He was killed by means of a highly toxic biological We don’t know. It’s affect on the dermis and Level Four decontamination procedures were At this point, we can only guess that the toxin Mulder.  Maybe you There seems to be a problem. A man just told Who am I? Who is he? Mr. Kaplan. Thank you.  Not even close. Shi….! Exactly what agency are you from? Obviously What the hell is going on? What about my life? I don’t appreciate being I don‘t know what you’re talking about. His true mission? Why him? Why choose Agent Mulder? To what aim? You’ve put Agent Mulder’s life in danger by not Including letting this man Haley get away with murder? What are you reading in there?  Thank you. I don’t know. But it’s going to help us establish Don’t be alarmed. Mulder … I know what you’re doing. Skinner told What happened to your hand? Oh, Mulder, what did they do to you? God, Let’s get the swelling down. They’ve killed again, Mulder. 14 people in Unless it was a test… for something bigger.  Why do this to you, Mulder?  What stopped him? It’s a bacterium. Was the bacterium also found on the ticket Well, then how was the biotoxin spread throughout It looks like streptococcus. But strep wouldn’t be able to survive any kind of Developed by the Russians? Well, then by whom?  The biotoxin was applied  Sir, are  I’d like  Thank you.  Yes, sir, that’s what we’ve been  What  Oh, damn.   What stopped him? Director Skinner, you’ve got to get to Mulder. Agent Mulder’s life is in danger -- and anybody You’ve got no choice. Well, he’s got to be on there somewhere. Mulder. We got here an hour ago before any of the I recognized you from the surveillance tape. Your finger. Mulder, before you go any further you should You knew about this all along. You knew Mmmmm ... what time is it? Why are you laughing? Mulder, what am I doing here? From what? From what? Mulder ... I was there? Doing what? Well, Mulder ... I don't know what to say. I mean, I - I don't have the first clue. Mulder, I have never been here. I couldn't tell you how to get here, She was there, too? You found more implants? Yeah, but it wouldn't explain why they would want to kill me. Mulder, when I met you five years ago, you told me that your Well, whether you trust them or not, they've led you here. And me. Is that what you really want? I'm okay. Uh, once ... but I have to be honest with you, I didn't have much luck. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh ... I'm, uh ... I'm with the others. Yes. And then ... and then it was gone. Oh, oh! It's, uh ... they're back. Oh, they're ... they're on fire! They're setting them on fire. I can't ... Their faces, I ... they have no faces. I ... they have no eyes. They're surrounding us! They won't stop! They won't stop! They see it. They were attacking them. The ... the faceless men. They're ... oh, my God, I can't - No. Now it's coming at us. Oh, my God! No! Cassandra! They're ... they're taking her. They're ... oh, my God. I can't ... No. I ... Okay. You've been here the whole time? No, sir. Neither was I. I've listened to the tape several times, and I don't have a clear Well, we - we don't know anything more. Did he say why? No, actually, Agent Mulder hasn't. I thought you were here about your mother. We talked about how she was feeling. We talked about a lot In what way? Is that what you were afraid people would find out? I don't understand. She told you to say those things? For what? Why are you here, Agent Spender? Why did you show this to me? I think that Dr. Werber would beg to differ. I appreciate your opinion, agent Spender, but I don't have a Mulder? What are you doing sitting here in the dark? Thinking about what? Well, I've just taken a long walk and I've reconsidered that What is this? Mulder, he's armed and well within his jurisdiction. I know this man. That driver. I know his face. What happened?  I came in search of  Now I must work to Who's there? Who's there?! What do you want? I asked that no one be told about it... nor You knew Dr. Merkmallen? Well... I was working late last night Why? Caused by the ship out there? Let's get him in the truck! He's got Okay!  I feel you slipping What is it? Look, I'm sorry. I don't speak your Stay away from me! You're the murderer here. Dr. Merkmallen! You don't even believe in that.  I'm here only  What is it?  The work here is painstaking-- What? I found more, too. 24 panels... One for each human chromosome. You're sick, Dr. Barnes. You need to I'm only here to help my friend. It has power. We have to get to the police. Stop! That was him. That was the man I saw Oh, God. What are you doing? What happened to you? You slammed on the brakes. There was No. He was right there-- sitting right where Turn us around. No ... I'm going home. Where is he? Is he still in the hospital? Is he still at Georgetown Memorial? Do you know where he is or don't you?! I have been on a plane for 22 hours. What kind of trouble? Kritschgau? Responsibility for what? He's not dying.  He's not dying. Maybe as his partner... but not as his doctor.  Mulder, it's me. How did you get in here? What's that supposed to mean? Like you? Almost killing him by shooting I don't believe that. Well, whatever it is, it's killing him.  Scully.  Why? What happened? There were guards posted here. A man How did this happen? His mother? Has anybody spoken with her? Sir, this isn't just a case. This is Sir! Don't move. Who's there?  What are you Surprise? That you're standing here. He's missing. He's very ill. Yeah. I know who that is.  This is Dana Scully.   Sir, did you send  This book. It explains  It's all here, sir-- a foretelling Sir... Are you hurt? Are you cut? Hey! Stop that man! You told someone, didn't you? You let A man attacked Skinner in his office. For what he knows about Mulder.  What is this? These are By whom? What? This was not supposed to go public.  It doesn't matter. Bum a cigarette, Agent Fowley? Really? I could swear I smell cigarette Yes. Let's. Where's Mulder? I just want you to think. Think of Mulder Why do you come to me like this? Why? I don't think you're hearing me. Even if I did I wouldn't know how to save Are you asking me to pray? And you believed them. Traitor. Deserter. Coward. You're not supposed to die, Mulder-- not here. Not in a comfortable bed with the devil outside. No, Mulder, he's lulled you to sleep. No aliens. Have you looked outside, No, Mulder, you must get up. You must Mulder. Mulder, you've got to wake up.  Mulder, you've  No Mulder, no work. You have to go back  He was there-- we...  I don't know what Diana Fowley was found murdered this morning. And you are mine. How long has he been here? Who called you? Who called them? What for? Mulder. Oh, my God. Am I okay? Mulder, I haven't seen you in such a long time. I was so worried. What's happened to you? You're clear on what? Mulder ...  We're going to get you out of here. And they have him believing that he did it. Knowle Rohrer. To beg mercy with the man upstairs. Mulder. Mulder! Oh, my ... Damn it, Mulder. It's not funny to see you putting on that act. Mulder, why are they doing this to you? Mulder, they're saying you killed a man. Mulder, we'll get you the best lawyer. Mulder ... What's the matter? Mulder, it's me. No. That's why I'm here. Mulder, I need you to talk to me. Confide in me ... or we'll lose. You're scaring me. Mulder, I'm so scared that I've just got you back Well ... whatever you're doing ... you have no idea how much has Our son, Mulder ... I gave him up. Our son. I'm so afraid you could never forgive me.  God, where have you been? Where have you been hiding? Doing what? You found something, didn't you? Huh? What did you find?

Have you ever       It's not ice cream.   It's a nonfat       Oh, you're Mr. Live-it-up.    I don't care.  Mulder, this is a needle in a haystack.  These poor    Necessity is the mother of invention.       Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we    No-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!     Mulder!       Mulder!?  You cheat. I can't believe that you've been       Boring.   Mulder, can I ask you a personal    Did your mother ever tell you to go outside and play?  Mulder?    Mulder?    You just defaced property of the U.S. Government.    You rebel.    So, uh... I get this message marked "urgent" on my answering    No, I guess I have, uh... found more necessary things to do with      This my birthday present, Mulder? You    Okay.    Yeah.    Hips before hands.    Mm-hmm.    I'm in the middle.       Shut up, Mulder.  I'm playing baseball. What did he start taking away? And how did he do that? Is something wrong? Excuse me, but is General Callahan the superior officer? Assuming we would want to investigate him, who would Whatever. Well then we'd like to speak to him on our way out. Ask him to make himself available. Tell him that its our Let's finish this, Mulder. I would hope not, considering the extremity to Lt. Col. Yes, so we gathered. But his file is missing several Except for any mention of the death of his wife and two No doubt. But there is no record of any criminal or arson Not unlike Staff Sergeant Kevin Aiklen... isn't that correct, Six months ago, Aiklen also lost his family to a house fire. That's your conclusion, General. But I'd hope you'll allow No. I think he's got everything to hide. Mulder, I know this isn't what drew you to this case to begin But I think it's very clear what's going on here. The general is protecting his men, but what he's protecting I don't know. But I can think of several good reasons. That could be one. Considering the government's complete disavowment of But you're not buying it. General Callahan... There are bruises around her neck and her shoulder, The bruises and surrounding edema are consistent with a I'm sorry. Truly. Mulder, you're serious? That's not so hard to believe. Her screams would have been There's someone in the backyard. There was someone out here, I'm sure of it. Look. Find anything? Well, we've been a bit luckier. Whoever startled the General Forensics just lifted two matching indexes and a thumb. They're on the way to the NCIC as we speak. FBI! Open the door! Mr. Freely, you are under arrest for suspicion of murder. If you want an attorney, we will get you one... Captain Janet Draper... Staff Sergeant Kevin Aiklen... We've got him, Mulder. In addition to accessory to murder, you're looking at We know you weren't acting alone, Quentin. If that's the man they call Rappo. He's a suspect in two homicides. How's that? Damn it! He lied to us. I don't know. I'm adding it to the list. Are you coming? Not as worked up as I'm going to be. Suffocation. The bed sheet was stuffed down his throat. He did it all by himself. Not likely? Rappo? He can't even walk, let alone kill somebody. I know. You've been walking around with that thing since From what? What you're saying is this man, Rappo, is leaving his body Mulder... then why would he need Quintin Freely? That's insane... You mean, messages recorded backwards in songs? Mr. Trimble, we'd like to ask you a few questions about How's that? No one's answering and the machine's not picking up. General? General? He's having some kind of a seizure. Nurse! He's non responsive. Come on. Put him on monitors and prep the crash cart. And make sure the team ... Lt. Colonel! Get the keys, we have to open the door. Open the door! Lt. Colonel, open the door! Mulder, it's me. I'm on the roof.  No I haven't. Well, I just climbed up 12 floors, I'm hot, I'm thirsty and to Yes, I know that, but the threat was called in to the federal Mulder, when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the rational  Jesus, Mulder! I know you're bored in this assignment, Mulder, but You've gotta quit looking for what isn't there. They've closed Aww, now what? Oh, yeah. I had you big time. I saw your face, Mulder. There was a definite moment of panic. That was the face. I saw that face.  You're buyin'. Something sweet.  Scully.  You're funny. Where are you, Mulder? Is that you pounding? Nice try, Mulder. Come on, Mulder ...  Hold on, Mulder, I'm gonna get you out of there. I need this building evacuated and cleared out in 10 minutes!  Don't think! Just pick up He found it in the vending room. He's locked in with it. Mulder, move away from the door, we're coming through it. Can you defuse it? Come on, Mulder. Mulder, what are you doing? Mulder ... Mulder, get in the car, there's no time!  They're asking for you, sir. All I told them was the truth. Mulder, they have divided us. They're splitting us up. I have a meeting with OPR day after tomorrow for remediation Because they wanted me to invalidate your investigations They're not doing this.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.  I'm sorry. Mulder. (she hands Mulder his jacket, which he left on the No. Are you drunk, Mulder? Was that before or after you decided to come here? Go home, Mulder. It's late. What are you doing? This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas? And you're looking for ...? I can tell you that without even looking at him. (she picks Oh my God. This man's tissue, Mulder ... There's been some kind of cellular breakdown. (she snaps Mulder, I can't tell you what killed this man. Mulder, you knew before we got here this man didn't die at You're saying this is a cover up? Of what? Mulder, this is gonna take some time. Somebody's going 
 Yeah? 
 Mulder, I can't really talk right now. Evidence of a massive infection. I don't know. Mulder .... Mulder, I have a hearing tomorrow... Mulder, I can't! I'm way past the point of common sense here. I wasn't planning on it. Particularly not after spending a half Something I couldn't show to anybody else. Not without But, what those men were infected with contains a protein code That I don't know. But, unless it can respond to conventional I don't know, Mulder. I don't see any evidence of an Both sets of bones were porous, as if the virus or the No. Looks pretty green for this climate. The equipment looks brand new too. Do you boys live around here? You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that? I think you better tell us. Well, we're FBI Agents. I don't know, Mulder. That's the first question to answer if we're going to find them. About a hundred miles of nothing in both directions. We've got two choices. One of them's wrong. I don't know why, I think they went right. This is great, this is fitting. I have to be in Washington, D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing, Evidence of what exactly? Mulder, they haul oil in tanker trucks, they haul gas in tanker What do you mean? .... Mulder? .... What are you not  I don't b ... Mulder, What? (she holds her arms out by her sides, asking what What do you think they are? This is weird, Mulder. Any thoughts as to why anybody would be growing corn It's cool in here. The temperature's being regulated. Mulder, I think we're on top of a larger structure here. I hear a humming... Like electricity, high voltage maybe... Yeah? I can't see! I don't think so. Mulder!  Mulder! Mulder! Where'd they go? Yes, I apologize for making you wait. I have new evidence. These ... are fossilized bone fragments that I've been able Yes. .... and I also have reason to believe that ... there may Yes, I know. Nnn ... not completely conclusive. I hope to but we 
 ... with Agent Mulder. Salt Lake City, Utah. Transfer effective immediately. I already gave Skinner my letter of resignation. I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not even to tell you You're on the verge, Mulder. Please don't do this to me. I have, I did, it's done. You don't need me, Mulder. You never have. I gotta go. Why did they assign me to you in the first place, Mulder? Ow! Something stung me. Mulder ... something's wrong. I'm having lacinating pain in ... ... my chest. My motor functions are being affected. My pulse is thready ... a funny taste in the back of No ... I have no allergy. Cold ... I'm cold. I can't. I had you big time. Mulder! I see it. What is it you find incredible? No, they don't. I don't believe the FBI currently has an investigative unit I told OPR everything I know. What I experienced, the virus, Well, then we'll go over their heads. This is different, Mulder. I can't. I won't. Mulder, I'll be a doctor, but my work is here The deficiency in lipid metabolism and the severely diminished enzyme output. Both indicate lysosomal storage illness. Scully. Dana Scully. I think you have all my results there, doctor. My fear is that it's a type 2 degenerative brain disease like Sandhoff disease and his enzymes aren't clearing the lipids from his brain, causing atrophy. I've done that. What I'm looking for here, doctor, is a course of treatment. Hi, Christian. How are you feeling? Me, well I'm doing just fine, thank you. Yes. We're going to do some more tests. Excuse me. I can guess who you're with. I don't work with Fox Mulder any longer. I don't work with the FBI. You've become awfully trusting Mulder, for a man wanted by the FBI. Well, they do at the FBI apparently. I had a visitor today, Mulder. The FBI want your help finding a missing agent. They say all is forgiven. That they'll drop all charges against you if you come in and help them solve this case. I think they are. Desperately. Someone's come forward with some promising evidence. A psychic, he claims. Mulder, if the FBI wanted to get you, I have no doubt that they could. I think they've just been happy to have you out of their hair. A young agent's life is at stake. Mulder, I know I don't have to say this , but it could have been you once, or me. You know, the truth is, I worry about you, and the effects of long-term isolation. I'll tell them your answer. Dana Scully. How long as she been missing? I know you know this, but after 72 hours there's a slim chance that she's still alive. I don't understand. It's a man's arm. Father? He was a priest? What is this? Dorms? Actually, I'd like to ask something. What was it you were praying for in there, sir? And you think God hears your prayers? I didn't bugger thirty-seven altar boys. I have another word, if you like. Maybe it's not God doing the sending. Maybe what you see is a way to try and make people forget what it is that you really are. Jesus, Mulder. I'm sorry. I've had too long away from this business. Or not long enough. Well, he's a creep, and a liar. He knows who did this and they're supplying him with information. And look where he lives. And this arm they found - it wasn't severed in any fight, it was cut cleanly, chopped off. And tell me how he's been able to lead them straight to it and not even muster a guess as to where the victim is? And two things you're going to find in the next 24 hours - a dead agent and that this guy, Father Joe, is a big fat fraud. What are you doing? Yeah, well, it's been fun. Thanks, but I've already been taken for a ride. Anyway, he doesn't want me there. This isn't my life anymore, Mulder. I'm done chasing monsters in the dark. I think you've done all they've asked of you here too. You know, no-one says you have to stay here. Hi, Christian. You're looking very bright-eyed this morning. Yeah? What were you thinking? Well, you know, I'm thinking exactly the same thing. What's wrong? Has something scared you? What man? Don't be afraid. I was just looking for those. That isn't really your purview, Father. It's his primary physician's.  Can I have the test results, please? I'm sorry, can't sleep. Just a little something? I have a patient. A young boy with a rare brain disease, and he's very, very sick. I thought there was something I could do. Well, there's radical treatments but nobody wants to talk about those. Even the experts say there's nothing to be done. Nothing but let him die. So I'm lying here cursing God for all his cruelties. Why bring a kid into the world just to make him suffer? I don't know, Mulder, I've got such a connection to this boy. You think it's because of William. Thank you. Scratchy beard. Oh. There was something weird on that toxicology report of the severed arm. I looked over the FBI evidence reports again, and in the tissue there were traces of a drug that's commonly given to patients being treated with radiation. And also traces of a drug called Acepromazine.  Acepromazine's an animal tranquillizer. Mulder? I can't even begin to speculate. Who? Mulder, what are you doing? He's a phony, Mulder. He pulls these so-called visions out of thin air, and now he's got you straining to connect them. Tears of blood? Hello. Yes. Has there been a break? The same source. Did you find her? You said there was news. Mulder. Stop.  This is not my job any more, Mulder. You're right. This is my fault.  For getting you involved in this. This is not about finding an FBI agent. This is about you trying to save your sister. It hasn't stopped you from looking for her. Mulder, I have been through this too many years with you, believing you can you save her. You cannot save her, not now and not ever. What are you doing? I'm sorry, what decision? That was a discussion, not a decision. I have an objection. But he's my patient. There is a treatment. No, it's not. The disease can be treated with intrathecal stem cell therapy.  Would you do it if it were your son? And it's not a decision for hospital administration, it's his doctor's. If you would like to challenge that you can take the matter up with a higher authority. Hi, Christian. You've got a whole bunch of people taking really good care of you today, okay? What? I'm sorry, Mulder.  I had to keep my focus here. Yeah. I'm taking a big chance on something. On a radical and extremely painful new procedure. It wasn't, last night. There's a series of these procedures and we won't know until they're all done. But that's not what you came to talk about. Organs - harvested for transplant. That's how they were targeted. Donors and recipients need matched types. Someone using that pool knows that. Well, they have access. Recipients, hospitals. You can start with the transporters. Call the Richmond D.A. No, no, Mulder. Mulder, you helped them already. You broke the case for them. Why don't you just let the FBI pursue it. And I'm asking you let it go. No, it's complicated. Something that I knew would happen, that I've been afraid of, that I haven't had to face until now. I'm a doctor, Mulder. That's not my life any more. You're not understanding me. I can't look into the darkness with you any more, Mulder. I cannot stand what it does to you or to me. Yeah, that's what scares me. I'm asking you to look at yourself.  We're not FBI any more, Mulder. We are two people who come home at night, to a home now. I don't want that darkness in my home. Write it down. Put it in a book. No. I can't tell you to do that, Mulder. But I can tell you that I won't be coming home. Mulder, I've got my own battles to fight. Please don't argue with me. I don't know what else to do. You too. Have you been in to see him? But you don't even know if it's working yet. I see. No. Have you spoken to Father Ybarra? What if it did work? What if we found we'd made the wrong choice by stopping? I'm saying I don't want to give up now. May I speak with you? I won't be staying long. Yes.  You said something to me the other night in the snow. I need to know why you said that. Do you know anything about me? Do you know what it is that I do? He's not my husband. No! I don't think you're... You deserve to be judged. This doesn't make it any less sickening. Not from God! What?! Don't you quote scripture to me! "Don't give up"! What was that for?! I don't believe you! They were your words! You said them to my face! You can ask for His pity, but don't expect mine. You can stop the act any time. Look at me! Paramedics have been here now for about seven minutes. He's stabilized. Blood pressure's normal. No, they're loading him in now. Thank you.  He had a seizure. No-one. Well, that's not going to happen. In custody? What's that got to do with Father Joe? Who? Mulder, now you're wasting their time. Mulder. It's over. What! Mulder! I heard. Sorry. I know you did, Mulder. You still want to believe him.  I think you should know that he has been diagnosed with a terminal illness. He has advanced-stage lung cancer. Then let me ask him. Did he happen to look like this? We think he's the man who abducted the FBI agent, and the second woman you say you saw and possibly many more. And we think that is helped by this man. I'm fairly certain that you do. And that you've known him since he was a boy. Let me ask you one more question, Father Joe. The FBI agent, the first woman that you saw, Monica Bannan. Is she still alive? Mulder. Mulder, you think I don't understand, but I do. This stubbornness of yours, is why I fell in love with you.  Shit. Mulder I just found something in my stem cell research. Experiments being done in Russia on dogs, Mulder. I think that's what your suspects have been doing, only on humans. Those women who've been abducted - you've got to call me. Mulder, the FBI agent's alive. I've been trying to find you for hours. I can't reach Mulder. Yes, it's Dr. Scully. If I knew that I wouldn't be calling. Listen to me! I need your help! Then let me talk to somebody there with some balls who can. I'm Dana Scully and that's my car. Yeah, that's him. Walter Skinner.  Is there any indication what happened, or any footprints? It's his cell phone. It's got blood on it. Wait a minute. Back up. Stop. Proverbs 25
2. The glory of God to hide a thing. I've got it. It's an invoice for medical supplies to a Dr. Uroff-Koltoff. It's an address on Bellflower Road. Listen. Dogs. Dogs! Mulder. Can you hear me? Mulder needs warm clothes and fluids. Oh, god. I've got work to do here. Mulder? Father Joe is dead. He was clearly a very sick man.  He's dead, Mulder. We'll never know. Mulder. Do you think they're really going to take your call? Well, considering his crimes against those young boys, who is really going to care? I wanted to believe him. I did believe him. I acted on that belief. He told me
 Don't give up.  And I didn't, and it saved your life. But I've put that boy through hell. And I have another surgery scheduled for this morning, because I believed that God was telling me to. Through a pedophile priest, no less.  Try proving that one, Mulder. I'm due at the hospital. I think that was clearly meant for you, Mulder. What do you mean?  Please don't make this any harder than it already is. As far away from the darkness as we can get? I know it does. Yes.    "T-h-e-e-f."  I assume it's supposed to be t-h-I-e-f-- "thief."    Well, that's certainly one question.  I've got many.    To be fair, I might have used the words "Mulder, how is this an X-File?"    Which would certainly shine the light of suspicion on them.    Which is why the police are rightly wondering if Dr. Thalbro killed himself.    I'll admit, Mulder this is not an open and shut case.  But, uh … (whispering    Dirt?      Hexcraft, as in, uh, putting a curse on someone?  Murdering them    No, hexcraft. I mean, I'll buy that as the intent here.  It certainly jibes with    I'll always keep you guessing.    Sir, can you think of any enemies that your father-in-law might have made?    Uh-huh.    Uh-huh.      Kuru.    From eating the brains of their relatives.    Practically speaking, Mulder, Kuru doesn't even exist anymore.  Not in New    Yeah, stark raving, among other things but in this case, stark raving mad    Mulder, that's what his autopsy shows.  From the wound pattern to the blood    We understand you've made a diagnosis.    In San Francisco?  It's unheard of.  Maybe in... in Central Africa...    Sir, regardless of the particulars I think it's clear that there was an intruder in    Oh, yeah, Mulder, win him over.    What do you suggest?    Well, actually, we're not here for us.    It's dirt.    Goofer dust?       A voodoo doll.    Which would mean what?    You believe that your wife was murdered?    Sir, we can't help you if you withhold information from us.    You gave her morphine.  Lots of it.    What makes you think it's her father?    If Lynette Peattie was Carlos the Jackal I would've had an easier time    Her name shows up once in the records of a Vista inoculation program--    That's when her father, one Oral Peattie refused to allow her to be inoculated    Here?  His daughter's grave?    Lynette Peattie's body.    Well, what's important is that he believes that.  At any rate, if he can't find       Scully.       What happened?       I didn't see anybody following us.       Okay.    Stay where you are.    Oh!  Oh, God!       I don't know.  I can't...      I can't see.    Just stay where you are!  Stay down.    Leave him alone!    Doctor...  What's happening?    Dr. Wieder!    She's going back to her people after all.  You know, Mulder, I would've    Except maybe it's not.    Hi.    You said on the phone you'd received something urgent.    You going to tell me what it is?    What?  What is it?    All right, what's going on here?    What kind of encounter?    Assistant Director, I've got drawers full of reports that begin just like that.       Are you trying to tell me this has something to do with    Teresa Hoese was the young mother who was abducted the night before    Returned?    What is her condition?       In the x-rays, did you see, um...    Little pieces of metal.  Implants.    You do... Richie.  From Oregon.  We met late last spring, you remember?    Agent Doggett?  What was that in there?    You refuse to believe that anything other than a man could have done this.    And for months, we have been looking for a break, which is what we've got       What if he's dead?    I'm sorry.  I just had a bad dream.    I once had a talk with Mulder about starlight.  How it's billions of years old.      Stars that are now long dead whose light is still traveling through time.  It    Maybe that's the only thing that never does.  He said that's where souls       Yeah?  … Hold on. … Who took her?  … Well, has anybody    Did you find her?    No?  I don't understand.  You called us all the way out here.    Another point of view?  We have a patient missing, Agent Doggett.    Hear who out?    Expertise in what?    Ritualistic crime?  Are we working the same case here?    Interesting?    Isn't that what you're here to tell us?    I'm sorry, this feels like therapy.    What "who" wants to have happened?    It may involve someone close to me.  Can we stick to the facts, please?    Did you happen to know the peculiar nature of her injuries?    But you think that it is.    So, what do you think happened?    So you're basically saying that Agent Mulder has joined some sort of UFO    I see.    Are you asking me to believe this?    Based on what?    I'm glad you agree with her, Agent Doggett, because I'm not even sure that    Enjoy your new company.    I thought you'd be out combing the hills with Agent Doggett.    Is there something you're looking for, Agent Reyes in particular?    Implants?  I don't understand.    Yeah, I'm well aware of how they work.    I don't understand your interest in what is commonly considered evidence of    Excuse me.  I, I, uh, I'm very confused.  I know what I heard and I heard    You believe in extraterrestrials?    What is it you specialize in again?  Ritualistic crime?    We should talk sometime.    And what beliefs are those?    And do you have any feelings about Agent Mulder?       Examination of victim, Gary    You can go now, Richie.  They just need you to sign a form.    I'm okay.  There's work to do here.    Teresa.    You better get AD Skinner in to see this.  And Agent Doggett.       Agent Doggett.    You, uh... you say that these abductees are returned with severe injuries.    Sir... given the criminal charges against you, you couldn't be a less credible    So these video cameras that you have around your compound-- how do they    Do you have videotape of how you happened to heal Teresa Hoese?       I asked you to give me the truth.        Do you have videotape of this man?      I saw him.    I saw something.    Who is it?    Well, then where's another angle?    Wait a minute. Stop it.    That man.  I know that man.    His name is Jeremiah Smith.  Agent Mulder knew him.  He believed that he    Like he did Teresa Hoese.    Wow.  That's still Jeremiah Smith.    Exactly.  We have to get back out there.       We're looking for someone.  A man who may be    FBI.  Where is he?  Jeremiah Smith.    Look, I know he's here.  Jeremiah Smith.  I need to speak with him.    You-- in the back.  Step out.    Come with me.    Take a seat.    Are you Jeremiah Smith?    Did you heal these people?    Did you heal Teresa Hoese?    Look, I know who you are.    Where's Mulder?    Where is Mulder?    What is it?    Where is he?    How bad is he?    How bad is he?    How bad is he hurt?       No.  No.  No.   No.  He needs help.    He needs help!    Jeremiah.    No...  no.  This is not happening!    No!    Yeah, Scully.    Mulder, what time is it?    Las Vegas?  Why?    What, exactly?    Yeah, I trust you, Mulder, it's the Three Stooges I'm not so    Okay.  Okay, okay.  Okay.    Could you, uh, take this up, please?    Where's Agent Mulder, I've been trying to call him.    By all means, bring me up to speed.    You know this man?    What's going on here?    You're absolutely sure you wanna be here for this?    Okay.    James Bellmont, age 29.  Visual exam reveals injuries    Who's "they?"    I'll begin with the Y-incision.    Langly, will you go over there and pass me the striker saw    Are you okay, Langly?    What happened?    Yeah, I guess.    Sure, cutie.    Done, done, done.  How do you roll this    My medical opinion?  BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!    That's all I know.    Aw, hey.  Long time, no see.    No, that's not nice.  I like Hickey.    But who's got a match?    Well ... I just can't decide who lights my fire.    Maybe next time.     Hi.      Okay, okay, okay, okay.    Hi ...      Hi, cutie.      I'm an FBI agent.    Federal agent.  Call for help.    Shooter got away.  Detain this man,       I'll take him from here.      Hello, Mulder?  Can you hear me?      I can't truly believe I'm really standing here.      Blood, electrolyte imbalances, a loss of brain function.   I strongly believe      If we can stabilize him and his temperature we can give him courses of      Mulder, you okay?      Well, you might want to consider sitting down when you hear what we      Now, it's, uh... it's good news.  It's... it's miraculous news.      Whatever neurological disorder you were suffering from, it's no longer      Mulder, you are in perfect health.      Must feel good to be home.         It's clean.      Yeah.  She wasn't as lucky as you.      Mulder... I don't know if you'll ever understand what it was like.  First      I prayed a lot.  And my prayers have been answered.      Yeah.      Mulder...      No, I think Kersh wants you to quit, Mulder.      Well, I think the question is, Mulder, are we going to sit here and let this      I've had a partner for the last several months.  He was assigned to help me      Agent Doggett is above reproach, Mulder.  He's being manoeuvred just like      I can't reach him.      I know.  And I'm all over it.  I will find him.      I don't know if this is going to make you feel any better.         Mulder...      What are you doing here?      Please, you do not want to stir that up right now.       Yes... It does.  Why?      He's right.  You're right.      You think he knew something?      Mulder, you make it sound like this was a conspiracy.      Mulder, I know you know this, but if anything leaves this room you could      Mulder, just being here could be used by Kersh as cause for dismissal.      I just don't know what you're hoping to find in Howard Salt's personal      So you'll risk the consequences even though there may be nothing here?      Mulder, you've been through an ordeal that defies all logical explanation.      Mulder, if you go down the X-Files will go down, too.  I mean,      It's been encrypted.      What are you doing?      I'll book it for you.      So much for playing a hunch, Mulder.  The, uh, Gunmen were able to      Fifteen minutes after Howard Salt was shot at the White House, firewalls      Agent Doggett?         Could you wait minute?      What are you doing here at is hour?  You're freezing cold.      What do you have to give him?      Oh, yeah, Agent Mulder knows that already.      Who gave you this information?      You have this, this password?      I'm, um... I'm not exactly sure I should tell you, Mulder.         Oh, man.      What are you doing here?      He wouldn't listen to me.      I can't do that to him.      What?!      No.  You explain it to me now.  Set us up how, and with whom?      Agent Doggett!       Something's wrong.       I think we've been set up.  You have to get Mulder out of there.       Get him out of there, Gunmen.       What is happening, Byers?      No, no, ma'am.  This is just a routine background    You ready to quit?   Scully.      I'm on my way.    I've been called into Kersh's office.      Just me.    Sir.      Agent Ritter.        Margareta  Stoller age 57, cause of death-- an       A NEIGHBOR CALLED THE POLICE AT 11
14 p.m.    The clock says that it's 45 minutes earlier.   Well, a clock can be    Hmm.  Almost an hour and a half later.    And you suspect this man Fellig?  You think that Mrs. Stoller    That's quite a theory.    You can tell the time of day by the shadows.       You've got another suicide here a heart attack and a    Agent Mulder and I will begin immediately.    Mulder...    What are you doing?      It's not an X-File.    Thank you.  All very helpful.    No.    This is a one-time thing.    Peyton Ritter, this is Fox Mulder.    We should get going.    Well, he sometimes doubles as a crime scene photographer for your    There's not much in the way of personal information there.    Would you happen to know when the original background check was    I think I've got it.  1964.    Maybe.    Take a look at this.    1996... '87...'73    You're thinking this was Fellig's work?    What's this?    Yeah. I got that.    Where's the second body?      Mr. Fellig your fingerprints were found on a murder    Your fingerprints were found on the knife.  How did they get there?    Why would you do that?  Were you injured Mr. Fellig?  You seem to    May we see?     May I help you?      I thought we were looking for the truth.       Scully.      Mulder, it's not...  (waits for AGENT RITTER to step      How do you know about that?      Well, we were able to pull another set of prints off of      That and the fact that Fellig's blood was found all      I don't know what to think.  (looks up as FELLIG passes      Mulder, where are you getting this stuff?      Mulder...    I'm parked around the block.    Mr. Fellig, open up, please!    Explain this.    You took that photo an hour before police arrived.  You then    You have, Mr. Fellig, a long and uncanny history of being the first    Are you a murderer?    Well, then explain yourself, sir.  Because, I promise you until you    It's been an hour.  Are we going to drive around all night?    What shot?    What...  what are you talking about?    Look, Mr... Fellig, I don't know what you're planning but nobody       That …  that woman right there is going to be    You want me to believe that?    FBI! Don't move!    Shut up!  Get down!  Back up!      You all right?    Assault and possession of an unregistered handgun.  I'll be with    I apologize.    No offense, but the surveillance was blown before I got there.    I confronted Fellig.  I questioned him further about his    He said that he can tell when people are about to die.  Look, if    A convicted murderer half Fellig's age.    He's right. Tell me, Ritter, did he have any help concocting that    No judge is going to issue a warrant based on this.    Uh, he did?        Scully.    And we're done with this conversation.       Yeah?      It is.      Alfred Fellig seems to know an awful lot about death.      Excuse me?      But Mulder, that must be some kind of a mistake.       I have spent time with this man and-and he can't be    You are going to be arrested, Mr. Fellig, in two hours, charged    What you showed me was a contemptible lack of compassion for    "Lucky"?    Who's he?    You're saying that this is a photograph of Death itself?    And this is the shot that you spoke of-- this is... what you try    Mr. Fellig, I know... that you know more about photography than I      Okay, I mean... mmm …  for the sake of argument... why    You know I don't believe you.    How is it you know when people are about to die?    Excuse me.      Mulder, it's me.      Those other two names that you said that Fellig went      What about Louis Brady?      Will you check it out for me?      I'm sticking here to make sure he doesn't bolt.  Louis    Mr. Fellig?    You know, most people want to live forever.    I think you're wrong.  How can you have too much life?  There's too    What about love?    Why are you this way?  I mean, if this is true give me something in    Took your place?    But he didn't.    What do you mean?    Wait a minute.  Say what's on your    You took my picture.  You took my picture last night.  Is this why?    I'm not going to die!    Turn that off.    Turn it off right now!  Put it down!    You took my phone.  Why?    What don't you want me to know?    What don't you want me to know!?    Shut up!    Yeah, Mulder, I don't even know how I entertained the thought. But sir, the very nature of the X-Files cases often precludes No, sir. No, sir. If anything, I'm suggesting that these cases be reviewed On X-Files cases investigated by Agent Mulder and myself to May I ask, sir, what more you require? I understand, however... conventional investigation of these Mulder, your testimony, you sounded so... I was called into a meeting by Assistant Director Skinner. Just wanted to reel me in. Mulder, wait... Okay, well then I'll keep surveillance with you. That was thirty or sixty years ago. Mulder, that's going to entail unorthodox methods of investigation. Detective Briggs, you've helped us so much before. Now we have As were the four most recent murders. That doesn't prove that it belongs to a person murdered by Tooms. And what makes you positive? And what does your instincts say about where Tooms buried the Ground-penetrating radar. It bounces signals off of objects Well, it signals if something inordinate is present. An experienced Mm-hmmm. Well, it's an educated guess. How are we doing? Can you determine the cause of death? My instinct says that Well, we’ll keep it off the record. Well, it’s a start. Ooh! It’s liverwurst. Mulder, you know that proper surveillance requires two pairs This isn’t about doing it by the book. This is about you not Well, then I’ll stay here. You go home. Fox... Mulder, I wouldn’t put myself on the line for anybody but you. Must be fate, Mulder. Root beer. Wouldn’t miss it for the world. Sir? I was engaged in the unauthorized surveillance as well Sir, I would expect you to place the same trust in me as I do These are Eugene Tooms’ dental x-rays obtained from the Druid This software can create an exact three-dimensional model of Where would he go? No, I already checked on that. They tore down that apartment If he is drawn to this location for some reason, maybe this  Mulder? Okay, let’s go. The caterpillar? How do you know?    Should we arrest David Copperfield?    Well, maybe he was killed elsewhere.    I don't know.  It's, uh... it's not a simple bisection.  There's a    Oh.    Spontaneous human combustion.    Well, isn't that where you're going with this?    Mulder, there are one or two somewhat well-documented cases.    Mulder, shut up.    Okay. What do you make of this?    And who is Pinker Rawls?    So you're saying that a ghost did this?    So we're looking for a dead man?    Okay. Well, at the risk of further ridicule, Mulder, what if this    Well, then how did Rawls or whoever do this?  How did he get in       Wilson Pinker Rawls, age 34.  Eight years       His record dates to 1978.  Mostly small-time.    Whoever he was.    Mulder.    Oh, my god.    Pistol in his hand, slide locked open, shell casings everywhere.    Bo Merkle.  This is his house.    $90,000.  The wire office robbery eight years ago.  The money    I don't think Mr. Merkle did either, judging by the decor.    Yeah.       I can run down the name.      Yeah, this is Special Agent Dana Scully with the FBI.    Got a name to go with the face.   June Gurwitch.  There's no    The state police have put out an APB on Rawls.    Look, Mulder, even if those were bullets...    Even if these were bullets, there is no way that they could pass    He walks through solid objects?    And flesh into carbon.    But where's the science in all of this, Mulder?  You're talking    I'm sorry I even brought it up.    June Gurwitch.    She has a sister named Jackie, and I have the address.    Jackie Gurwitch?  FBI!    Her son's spending the night at a friend's house and she's going    Maybe he left on foot or he stole another car.    Well, maybe he's still in the neighborhood.  I think the, uh,    To Meridian.  That's where June Gurwitch lives... or June Burdett       Agents Scully and Mulder with the FBI.  We are    An escaped convict by the name of Wilson Pinker Rawls-- we believe    They're fine.    So you took it.    It's best you both stay under 24-hour guard until Rawls is    Don't discuss this with anyone, Mr. Werther.    Rawls was in the trunk?      Mulder?    He stopped at the mirror.    Electrostatic repulsion.  Individual electrons repelling one    Resistance against electrical current.  A good insulator like    Say... say that your theory is correct- that he can walk through    Yet he turned this place upside down which means he was looking    Right.  Specifically, c-section.    Uh-huh.  "I want what's mine."  This man is looking for his child,    He has to intend for June to lead him to his child.    Yeah, but where?  We don't have a name or an address.  I mean,      Yeah, can you also check her alias, please?  It's       All right, thank you very much.  (she hangs up and    Sealed files?    Well, maybe she didn't go through official channels.  Maybe the    Okay... Everything's going to be all right.  We're going to get    Let's go.  Run. Run. Run.  Get inside. Get inside.  Get inside.    No! What are you guys doing here? What do you mean? Okay, where are we going?  I have ears. Will you tell me what's going on? Disappeared from where? I don't understand. What am I looking at? The Queen Anne? The British luxury liner? It was torpedoed by a German U-boat. There's another? So you're saying the Queen Anne just disappeared. That's impossible. There's nothing on here. To get where? He's gone out here? What's happened to him? Well, we have to get help. What do you need?  Wait for me downstairs.  I need to speak with him. Is he in? Sorry, this can't wait. Sir? I just received some very disturbing information, sir. Sir, I couldn't waste time explaining myself to your assistant. It's about Agent Mulder. He's done something incredibly rash. He may be lost at sea. You can't what? This isn't for me; it's for Agent Mulder. Don't you want to know what this is about?  Sir, this is about a man's life. No, sir, you're out of line. I'm sorry, but I'm coming to you Save your own ass, sir. You'll save your head along with it.  Sorry. I need a word with AD Kersh. Assistant Director Kersh, may I please have a moment of Uh, may I, sir?  Thank you. Sir, I need . I, uh... Sorry. I shouldn't have come unannounced. Uh... It's nothing, really. What am I thinking? What am I thinking? Sorry. (whispering, willing someone to answer the phone, hitting  Damn.  I want you to do me a favor. It's not negotiable. No, I'm not. I'm a gun ready to go off so don't test me,  Navy AWACS SLAR 100 K swath. Don't ask too many questions. I don't care what you do And, Agent Spender... If you're not back in a hurry I am  Oh, God.  Hello?  Yes.  I'm sorry, he's not here right now. Is there Yes? Yes, sir? I was just, uh... Yeah, I was waiting for Agent Spender, he was, uh...  That rat bastard!  Stupid!  Scully.   Hello? No... I can't understand. I can't... Is it you? How?  Sir, what you've done... Yes. Yes.  Yes.  Yeah.  What? Is it the Queen Anne? I don't believe it. They've got power. Let's hope he is. Byers? Langly? Frohike?  There you guys are. Mulder? Mulder, it's me. Hmm? You're in a hospital. Lie still. I don't blame you. You've been through the wringer, I'd say. You did something incredibly stupid. You went looking for a ship, Mulder. In the Bermuda Triangle. Hmm? Mulder, will you settle down? It's an order. Yeah... You're right. I did. Yeah, I bet you did. The boat that you were on was busted In your dreams.  Mulder, I want Yes? Oh, brother...   One day, you'll ask me to speak of a truth - of the miracle of Yes, thanks. And can I get a warm-up, please?  I've resisted contacting you for reasons I know you  I am physically shaking right now seeing your words. The child's mother, she was just here. Where did she go? What about Mulder? Well, who is he? Files on what? What does he want with Mulder? Well, even if this was a good idea I don't know how to contact him.  I'm sorry about that. I believe that last class we were covering petechia I'm trying to teach a class. That's the operative word here - somebody. Somebody that we don't know.  What I don't want is Agent Mulder's life to be endangered any Do what, Agent Doggett?  Do you need help, ma'am? Hey. Do you need me to call the police? Ma'am? Are you all right? Come on in. The phone's over there. Well, you've  obviously got a problem. I saw you this morning at the cafe. It's okay. I understand. I mean ... it's hard enough caring for a child. No.  But I wish I did. Do you have anywhere to go? I'm going to get you a blanket and something hot to drink, all right?  My name's Dana.  Hello. Yeah. I just laid down. What time is it? Put him down. Now! Put my baby down. You staged this, didn't you? Arguing on the street. Everything. It's a con job. What are you after? My baby? You got something to say, say it. What does he want with Mulder?  Hello. Who is this? You've been listening to us? You ever heard of the Constitution? What have they done?  Well, you're going to have to tell me 'cause I don't  Look why should I trust you? You're just a I'm going to meet your contact. I think you should watch William, Monica. You said I had to trust someone, right? Well, that's what I'm doing.  Hello. Yes.  I'm not sure I follow you.  Yes.  All right, what next?  Is it absolutely necessary to get innocent people hurt?  So where am I going? Where are you? Look, uh ... we're in the middle of nowhere. This is ridiculous. This has gone far enough. These clothes that I'm wearing ... they're my size. How the hell do you  Oh, my God. Who authorizes you? I mean, what gives you the right? Who are you?! Well, then why do it? I mean, why meet me?  Excuse me. I'm teaching a class, Agent Doggett. Is it something pressing? You're right to be worried. That guy didn't come to me, Agent Doggett, he came to you. That woman I don't believe that. That woman is truly scared for her child for the same reasons that I am. 'Cause that couple doesn't even necessarily trust the Shadow Man. I mean, for their own reasons. Mulder and I already considered that even before he left. His return has been pre-arranged. I can't. I've already sent for him. Mulder's on a train. He'll be here at midnight. You can't do that to me.  I want to see him so bad. Well, it's too late. And I have to go. Stop the train! I'm a Federal Agent!  Mulder! I know. I know that he was only trying to protect me. I know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Agent Doggett, what? Who? Well, where is he? Mulder. I've got to warn Mulder. Get on the radio! Get on the radio and alert them that there's a situation on that train. The man who fell on the tracks, he's gotten on that train. Okay. Mulder? Mulder? Mulder? Mulder? Stop there! Stop right there! Why do you want to kill us?! What are you talking about? What does this have to do with my son?  I hold no hope you can respond to this. Or that it reaches you. I only  I, Dana Katherine Scully, swear to tell the truth, the I left behind a career in medicine to become an FBI agent four. . . men who have no respect for the law and who flout it with With all due respect, Mr. Chairman, I would like to finish. Then why are we here, sir?  I respectfully decline to answer that question, sir. Because I believe answering that question could endanger Agent  Then if I could please finish my statement. . . that it No, sir. What I am saying is that there is a culture of lawlessness What makes you so sure? What makes you so sure that it's here -- that it's tonight? Well, so who do you think's leaking them, and why are they leaking Driver's dead. Mulder!  How'd you get involved with these men? What do you want, Krycek? You want this man brought to justice? What flight is he on? He still has to go through customs. Sir, federal agent. Don't be alarmed; I just need to speak with  Stop! Stop right there! Sir!  (Doors close with Scully Mulder, look. (Points at pouch, which is lying on a pile of  Is this some kind of joke? Not its origin, no. Are you saying. . . Does this rock contain fossilized remains, Dr. Sacks? Got something? Toxic? Mulder, that rock contains fossils of what is believed to be What he's given us, Mulder, is a rock. Alex Krycek is a liar, What I'm worried about is you, Mulder and how far you'll go. What are you doing? Mulder, it's me. Listen to me
 whatever's in that rock, it appears It's Dr. Sacks. He's. . . I don't know, Mulder. I've never seen Contamination is impossible unless there's a tear or a loss Look, there's a film over everything. Oh my God! This man's alive! No, I think he is.  I think he's in some kind of coma state I don't know, I don't know, but we have to get him out of here. Senator Sorenson wants to see us? Yes, but a summons for what?? It's hard to say. Agent Mulder is endeavoring to get his own answers, sir. Is that a rhetorical question, sir? We intend to file a complete report on this matter, sir, once Agent Mulder is in the field, sir, seeking answers to the questions    Mulder it's my distinct impression that you just cheated.  And that    Yeah, you got so much game I'm wondering if you have any work left      No "jagoff shoeshine tip"?    Well, about your J-O-B, Mulder somebody's been trying very hard to    About an X-File.    Didn't expect to find you here.    I thought Agent Spender offered you an X-File assignment.    But isn't it just the opportunity you've been waiting for?    You think it's a setup?    But Agent Spender asked you.    We've seen this before.  Bodies set aflame with no conclusive cause    I was with Cassandra Spender when she disappeared.  You sat with me    I was taken to one of those train cars.  I was tested, just like      Cassandra.    It's so good to see you.    We're old      I've got a surprise for you, Cassandra.    Agent Mulder told me he believed he saw his sister... last year.    Cassandra, you were found in a train car.  You'd been operated on    And these are the doctors who cured you?    But, Cassandra, the doctors weren't infected.  They were burned.    Why couldn't you tell Jeffrey?    Spender's life's in danger?    Working to do what?    Why risk getting caught here?    Maybe she was making it all up.    I bet you're curious about C.G.B.    C.G.B. Spender-- his name.  Cigarette-Smoking Man?    It's an alias, as far as I can figure.  One of hundreds.    Aren't you curious what I've got in the box?  Everything I could    Maybe.  But there's a picture you're going to want to see.    It was taken in 1973.  I traced the connection to something they    And there are other names connected to C.G.B. Spender and your    Yeah.    Sir.    It's true, sir.  We have documented evidence.    How did you find us?  Cassandra?    How did you get your clothes?    Mulder, what are you doing?    Mulder!  Mulder, we have to protect her.    Mulder?   Mulder! I have combed through every detail of this M.E.'s report. I have read and re-read it. And I am sorry, Agent Doggett, but the DNA fingerprinting does indeed exonerate this man. Actually, a hundred million. Agent Doggett, you don't...  It'd take at least 48 hours. Mr. Kailer, on the off chance that that's not true, what would be the harm in letting us look through your documents pertaining to this case? I mean, who knows. Maybe we can save the city some settlement money. There's a lot of material here. Where should we start? "Arresting Officer John Doggett." Must have been a career maker. You know, John?  Whatever we find here, sometimes... sometimes even good cops make mistakes. That's not what I think. It's not. I just... I just worry that maybe this is about you feeling guilty. Were you here all night? Speaking of DNA. The re-tests of the typing confirm the original results, that the hair samples do, indeed, belong to someone other than Robert Fassl. John, there is something else. Something that explains why 13 years ago, the science of the day identified the hair as Fassl's. I spoke to the forensic examiner who ran the tests, and he found a match in 12 of the 13 key genes. It means that the mitochondrial DNA in the hair sample is genetically similar to Fassl's. In fact, it is remarkably similar. It is so similar that it must be from a blood relative. I know. And yet, somehow it's true. No. Unfortunately, that's not gonna work. The 1989 evidence has to be thrown out. The hair samples logged to your crime scene, Agent Doggett, were not there on the day the crimes were committed. I am simply stating the facts, okay? The DNA evidence that was used to convict Bob Fassl... was planted. Excuse me. Agent Doggett? A.D.A. Kailer. I assume you haven't seen him? Apparently nobody has. Are you a Catholic, Bob? So am I. I remember times in my life when my Rosary was a great comfort to me. Comfort in times of tribulation. And watching you now, I get the feeling... that this is a tribulation for you. This man. Is it that he won't leave you alone, Bob? Is it that you just want him to go away? Tell us about him. Tell us so we can help make him go away. As in he couldn't admit his own sins? You mean water into wine? So what you're saying is because this man won't face himself, won't face his own sins, that he is forced to become someone else?  A killer. It's better that you don't. There are a lot of bodies in there. There are many more victims than anyone ever knew. Ms. Fain, I think we'd better get you home. No sign of him in four. Hold on. I think I have him in section four. Positive ID. He's heading toward you, three. Mulder, he saw me. He's heading towards the sound booth. I'm closing on him. I lost him. You got him, three? He must be headed your way. You got him, Mulder? Was that for the benefit of the general, or have you been I interviewed him and convinced him to take a polygraph test. The nature of his claims would suggest a false positive. The man who heads The Right Hand - Markham. Let Mulder and I serve it. Agents Mulder and Scully with the FBI. Mr. Markham? The murder of General Peter MacDougal. No, but your group is. And Private First Class Gus He's on the mailing list for The Right Hand. Well, we'd like to go over that list with you, sir. We already have a copy, if you'll just come with us. Sir, we have a warrant for your arrest if you don't You can make this as easy or as hard as you wish, sir. Would you take a polygraph, Mr. Markham? This guy's a one-man threat to national security. I bet Who's this? Mr. Markham, I'm sure that you're aware that in 1973 the The government kidnapped a US prisoner of war? I think I've heard enough. You don't believe him, do you? A phantom POW left for dead comes back to avenge the Or maybe not Denny Markham's war. Or it's just a clever story being proffered as a cover-up for Let Markham take the polygraph. He won't.  Is it true she made a positive ID from the Markham may have staged this whole thing, finding To create a decoy, to divert our attention. It seems to be Are you sure? Oh, your eye. I think you just burst a capillary.  Hold a tissue there. An eye exam? For what? Mulder, what she has is a simple sub-conjunctival What about you? What are you gonna do? Mulder, I'm at a Georgetown medical center. No, but the opthamologist discovered something. A floating blind spot. Well, any number of diseases can scar the retina. Well, does she have any of those diseases? It doesn't appear so. Well, not necessarily. Uh, the processes of the brain fill I asked the doctor that, and he laughed at me. Well, from my cursory exam, nothing about the general Not necessarily. He could have turned and been surprised. It's beyond my capabilities here to make that kind of Sir? Neither of us has a clear explanation, sir. That is conjecture, sir. Call it off. General Bloch? We need you to get out of the car, sir, for your own safety. Shooter! Get down! He was there! I saw him, I ... It was him, sir! I saw him, sir. It was him. He's doing all right. He's over there. I'm not really sure. I told you. I'm not sure, Mulder. How are you so convinced that General Bloch was his next Well, that doesn't prove that he was set up. You're saying they wanted Skinner to fail? Mulder, the government is not about to sacrifice the lives of Secondary to what? I think Denny Markham's story is having its intended effect. No sign of him in four. Hold on. I think I have him in section four. Positive ID. He's heading toward you, three. Mulder, he saw me. He's heading towards the sound booth. I'm closing on him. I lost him. You got him, three? He must be headed your way. You got him, Mulder? Mulder ... Mulder, he's gone. He's gone. He's with Skinner. What's going on here, Mulder? When you're looking directly at him? Have the local police been contacted by this woman's Any additional leads? I'm still not sure how you and I figure into this investigation. I assume that was taken by whoever it was who abducted her. Well, whoever it was that took this photo was obviously Is that where you keep it? Mind if I take a look? Your film's out of date. No, I was just making an observation. All right, so he doesn't exactly stand out as a suspect. Plus, the film is two years out of date. The, the photographic chemistry could have changed. She was a postal employee? Mary LeFante's passport photo. Do you know how soon she And you think that she faked her own disappearance? So you're thinking this woman planted that photo of herself in  I ... What are you doing? "Thoughtographs?" So that makes it legitimate? Oh my God! Who was here? Psychic photography? Mulder, I think that it's obvious that Into their darkest fantasies. Twilight sleep. No, it wouldn't.  Give her a PET scan. Oh my God. She's been given what's called a transorbital lobotomy. Whoever did this, Mulder, did it wrong. Mulder. What about the missing woman? What's her connection to the first victim? Yeah, the clock is running. It might be significant as a word. "Unrest." College. I'm working on these crime scene photos from the first abduction. How do you know? Is that what we're looking for here, Mulder? More evidence of I've got a bureau forensics team coming up from Detroit. We haven't found any new psychic photos here either. Wait a second. I want to show you something. Right here. This. (she shows him a photo from the first crime Where are you going to be? What if it's not, Mulder? This woman's time is running out. What have you got? What about day laborers? Gather officers to canvas.  Which foreman Find out where he is today. I'll take that one.  Hello? Hello? (she walks up a stairway onto a balcony that Uh, I hope so. Are you the foreman?  I'm Special Agent Dana Scully. I'd like No, sir, not at all. Excuse me. Sorry.  Scully. Yeah? Unruhe. (Schnauz suddenly looks nervous. Scully draws Don't move! Stop or I'll shoot! Hands behind your head! DO IT! Alice Brandt. The second woman that you abducted. Tell us where she is, Gerry.  No, you used this to kill the two men. You used this on Mary LeFante. Then why don't we get back to Alice Brandt. Where is she? It's over, Mulder. What the hell does it matter? I don't. Mulder. We just got a report of a strong-arm robbery. It's at the  What happened?  Thank you. He also took morphine, scopolamine, hydrobromide and insulin You know, that job site that I arrested him at, Mulder. What if Let's go. Corning. Send units to the 300 block of Belmont Avenue. Check all Thanks. Let me go. It's over, Gerry. Let me go right now. Aufhören! [Stop!] Ich habe keine Unruhe. [I have no unrest.] Why? Why me, Gerry? Do I remind you of your sister? OK, then let's talk about the howlers. I don't have them, Gerry. What if you're wrong, Gerry?. What if there are no such things If there are such things as howlers, Gerry, they live only inside It means you need help, Gerry. No, Gerry, stop! Mulder! I'm in here! Mulder! Help! Mulder! Addendum to case report. After his death, a diary was found       It's, uh, it's Agent Scully.  I'm sorry to wake you.       I got a call about 20 minutes ago from Assistant       An Agent is dead.  Um, Skinner had him       He's having difficulty determining that.       I'm sorry, Agent Doggett.  I can't go.       Um, something unexpected has come up.       Yeah, I'm, I'm fine.       Uh, as soon as I can.       Skinner told me about the case.  I know that       I appreciate your discretion.       I'm fine.  Skinner says that you're on the       I asked him to contact some friends of Mulder's.       Doggett, you're a good agent.  Trust your instincts.    Agent Doggett.   Hi.    Your door was unlocked.    I just woke you up, Agent Doggett.    Anthony Tipet is dead.  I got the call from Skinner on my    I seem to be, yes.    No. I'm, um... I'm back at work now.  That must have been    You don't think he succeeded?    Then where'd they come from?    It was a bad dream, Agent Doggett, but that's all it was. The Deputy Director is waiting, Agent Doggett.  Why didn't you tell me you were pursuing the Texas oil worker case? Well there's an executive here from the oil company who says he was contacted by a man in our office. What are you talking about? Who else are we talking about? Close the door and lock it. I didn't know who else to talk to, and I haven't been able to reach Agent Mulder. About what I found in my autopsy of the oil rig victim, Simon de la Cruz I found it by accident in the third ventricle of his brain. No it's OK, it's alright. No, it can, and I've seen that happen. But that's the thing - this man was clearly infected by the alien virus. It entered his system and it was massing in the pineal gland, but it's dead. Well intuitively, you would say the same thing that killed him - exposure to high levels of radiation. But it makes no sense because the virus itself has radioactive properties. No, you need to tell Deputy Director Kersh that he has to order a controlled evacuation of that rig right now. If the virus is loose, Agent Doggett's life is in danger. Orpheus, I've been trying to reach you for hours. This is Special Agent Dana Scully. I have an urgent message for an investigative agent on board, an Agent John Doggett. No I'm sorry, I need to speak with Agent Doggett directly.  Mulder? Mulder you can't just flout orders like this. It's not like old times. Kersh isn't going to tolerate this.  Mulder. I'd hate to say as of this morning I'd have to agree. Yes I did, and it's dead Mulder. Possibly radiation. I know I know, and this could be an isolated event, but that he's infected at all means that everybody out there could be at risk. And that means you and Agent Doggett. No Mulder, you need to get off the rig. Have Agent Doggett give the order. We can quarantine you and the crew when we get back here. And what if I can't? Let me talk to Agent Doggett. This man was exposed to a virus. To understand what your crew may be infected with. What they risk spreading on or off that rig. Unexplained behaviour, possible detection in the eyes .. Oh my god. Sir? To continue with my work, Sir. We could do that Sir, but all radio contact has been cut off. Sir, I think that would be a mistake ...  I think I've got something.  This is an SEM image pulled at random from anonymous donors. Blood. More specifically, normal T-cell antibodies. By comparison these are from the blood of the oil rig worker  T-cells in impossible numbers. In layman's terms, this victim was a virus fighting machine. Well, there are isolated cultures. In northern Italy for one, where people are immune to certain diseases - heart disease in that case, through a genetic mutation. Well his employment records list Mr. Simon de la Cruz as of mixed Mexican ancestry, when in fact he is Waicha Indian. The Waicha are an indigenous Mexican culture that has a rare undiluted gene pool. Now these genes may have an innate immunity to infection. No, not burned. Irradiated.  Because the virus had no effect on him. The crew members who were affected by the virus couldn't control him, so they killed him, by irradiating him. This man must have been a threat, because of something he knew. That I don't know. Agent Doggett? Can you hear me? What was that? Mulder, listen to me. I think I know why they killed this man, if not how they killed him. We've got choppers on the way. Mulder, where have you been? I've been trying to reach you all Visiting your mother? Mulder, I think the only thing more fortuitous than the emergence Yeah, well, don't look too hard. You might not like what you And look what happened. Wait... Mulder, what's going on? Hello? What is it? I'm not going to ask you if you just said what I think you just Where are you again? Were there insect bites on the body? 'Cause you know, Mulder, millions of people are actually allergic Mm-hmm. Many such reactions have occurred to entomologists or, You still want me to come up? Stay. Another roach attack? Are there still insects in the body? From the cockroaches? Well, was there any evidence of drug use at the crime scene? You know, Mulder, there's a psychotic disorder associated with The victim cuts himself in, in an attempt to extract the imaginary It's no bother. Bye. Who died now? A toilet? Check his eyes. It's probably a brain aneurysm. Straining too forcefully is very common causation for bursting Did you catch any? I don't know what to tell you, Mulder. I just hope you're not Mulder? I've been doing some research. No, but they do exhibit behavior different than our domestic I'm suggesting that what's happening out there might be the Mulder, you're not thinking about trespassing onto government Well, what's going on? What do you see? What does the place look like? Moving walls? What?! Mulder, you've got to get out of there right now! Are you all right? What happened? Mulder, what's going on? Mulder! Mulder! Mulder, are you okay? What happened at the U.S.D.A. site? Did he give you any idea of how to catch them? She? Did you know the inventor of the flush toilet was named Thomas Who? Her name is Bambi? Her name is Bambi? Yeah, sure, okay. You know, lots of people are afraid of insects, Mulder. It's A praying mantis? Mulder... Mul... no... What happened now? Mulder, I'm coming up there right now. Two cases of anaphylactic shock... Regardless, Mulder, something strange is definitely going on I still haven't been able to explain the cockroaches at all Metal? What are you talking about? Mulder? Excuse me, do you sell road maps? What's going on here? Have you seen any of cockroaches yourself? All right. Mulder, this town is insane. I'm in a convenience store on the outskirts of, uh... He has an import license... Mulder, I think you've been in this town too long. Let me guess... Bambi. No... this is no place for an entomologist. Mulder? Mulder! Mulder! There were others? Yeah, that would explain everything. Smart is sexy. Sorry, I would've gotten here sooner but the Beltway was a parking What do you mean? Does he have a history of mental illness? So, what's the X-File? And police found no other motive for either of these attacks? Hi. You're the physician in charge? Has he been sedated? You said you got this case last night, where did it come from? Who? And you're not suspicious that we're being used? How'd you get in here? Mulder. All I see are recordings of cable news shows. They're all dated You're the one who's interested. I'm going to show you something. Among other things, a one-hour special report on the atrocities And my guess is that once I review the tapes for the night that Well, recent studies have linked violence on television to violent But they believe that the causal connections are there, Mulder. All I'm saying is that I think it's clear that, that the programs The doctor suggested amphetamine abuse. Maybe that coupled with, Okay, then how do you explain it? Where are you going? No, I'm going to... watch the rest of these tapes. Just out Yeah. Yeah, I'll be right there. The car's been moved. Did you take it out last night? Nothing. Nothing, let's go see the crime scene. What happened? That blonde? So, this woman killed her husband because she thought he was Yeah, let's check it out. I think television plays a large part in both of these murderers' More tapes. Mulder, what are you doing? What is it? Maybe it's a job for Special Agent Pendrell and the Sci-Crime No, that's, that's fine, I'm... Where are you? I'm here. So, you had it analyzed? I just talked to Agent Pendrell, he said that you never showed Then where were you? What was that? There, that noise. Mulder... I told you, Mom. He's here to kill me. Just step back. It's not the truth, Mom. He's lied to me from the beginning. You're in on it. You're one of them. You're one of the people It is. Mom, just get out of the way! Ashamed. I thought you were going to kill me. I'm not following. Like me thinking that you'd betray me. I was so far gone, Mulder, That Cancer Man, the man who smokes all those cigarettes, I What do you mean? You think it could be him? I'm sorry I'm late, I just got back from the document section. The cable company employee had no criminal record. In fact,  Agent Reyes.  Do we know who he is?  Why are the lights off?  What do you mean?  And he says he knows me?  How did he get in the building?  His name is Miller?  What are you doing here?  Answers to what?  From your scarring, it appears that you've been burned.  Are you  Go on.  Did Mulder tell you that, too?  When?  That's his sister.  You seem to know a lot, Mr. Miller.  It gives an impression  Agent Doggett. Would you please arrange the transfer of this man  from the tissue quality, the scarring is fairly recent ...  What is it, then?  Injected with what?  What is it, Agent Doggett?  Well, who is he?  He said that he contacted Agent Mulder -- that Mulder told him...  That's ridiculous.  It's absurd.  I'm telling you, that's not Mulder.    Can you open your mouth, sir?  I need to look at your  Now your eyes.  Are you going I don't know how I can.  You, uh... refer to them as if I know them or know where they  Sir, you've given us a false name.  We know that your name is not  What is it?  Why lie to us, if you want us to help you?  You can put your clothes back on.  How can you help me?  It's not him.  It's not Mulder.  Yes.  And so will we all be once you bring me back his DNA tests.  Well, admittedly he's lying about who he is but the danger to him  Well, first, I think we need to quietly get him back to D.C.  To  You came here looking for something.  What is it that you hope to  And what does this have to do with you?  Yes.  This is what you're looking for.  Proving Agent Doggett wrong.  That that's not Mulder in there.  Mulder and I agreed to take those files out of the X-Files office  What are you doing?!  Get away from the crib!  It's none of your business!  Well, if that's true, then where the hell is he?  Just tell me where he is!  I have to know.  Then let me go to him.  That's not for you to decide.  It's all been a good act.  I think you do.  You knew those files were here.  I want the truth from you.  The truth that you won't speak.    Don't do this to me.  Not you.  How do you know my life?  What are you saying?  Just tell me who you are.  Come on, just say your name.  Say it!  This was a private conversation.  Do you know who that man is?  What is this?  What?  It's not him.  He wouldn't say these things.  It's not him.  No, thank you.  I just need a minute.  So, what now?  What do you want to do?  Well, that's not going to be hard.  Nobody's ever going to believe that that's Mulder.  If he's so afraid, then why did he run?  You know a person in so many ways.  Ways that a test can't even  If that was Mulder, I wouldn't care.  You believe that?  it's okay.  Oh, my god, there's blood!  Oh, my god!  What'd he do?  What'd he do to him?!  Where's Dr. Edwards?  He's been injected with something.  I've no idea. I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm a medical doctor, okay?  Can I ...  How is he?  Is he all right?  What did you find?  No ... I think it does.  It makes perfect sense now.  I have seen my share of the hideous of the disgusting and the  I never believed it.  You are as false as your face.  I bet you wish night and day that that bullet that was meant to  Your cigarette-smoking, son of a bitch of a father.  You counted on the DNA ... that we'd buy it without question and  You haven't seen Mulder, have you?  You haven't even talked to  I had this checked.  It's an unknown metal that you injected into  "A gift"?  So, what, you've prevented it now?  You've ... prevented alien  So, he's all right now?  I mean, just like that?  So, it's over.  They'll let him be.  Well, I can protect him.  Thank you.  And how should I prove it now?  By insisting that I can protect  He didn't have a choice to come into this life.  I don't have a  ... And shouldn't I choose that he never have to be afraid of    I believe I was taken by men who subjected me to medical    There was something out there in that field.       We will find him.    I'm having a hard time believing it.    I'm pregnant.    What is this?!  Excuse me.  Can somebody please tell me    For?    What manhunt?  Manhunt for who?    Look, there's nothing.  If you're looking for Mulder, you're    Well, then whose stupid idea is this?    There are agents tearing apart Mulder's office who say they're    They're not going to find Mulder this way.  You know that and    Look, I don't understand.  You are the Assistant Director.    Our cooperation?  With due respect, there aren't two people    You make us out to be suspects, sir.    I don't believe this.    Why do I get the feeling they'd be happy if we never found    Well, you heard Kersh.  They don't want the truth.    What good are you to Mulder if you give them the power to    We will find him.    Thank you.       Yes.    Why are they talking to you?    I'd say they have all the character profile they need on him.    I think I know Mulder as much as anybody.    What rumors are those?    Where'd that come from?    No.  When was this?   What's my theory?  My theory is you don't know Mulder at all.    "John Doggett."  Kersh's task force leader.  You might have    Nice to meet you, Agent Doggett.       Mom, it's Dana.  I, uh... I'm sorry I haven't    Mom?       You stay out of my business!       You better have a court order!       How many phones are you tapping?       Thank you. You just answered all my questions.    Stop there!  Right there!  Now come on through the window    I'm sorry, Mr. Coeben.  I'm sorry.  There was a man.       Who?  You... You don't mean Mulder?    Mulder?  Are you in here?    What are you doing here?    I came by to feed Mulder's fish.       You've got a way about you, Agent Doggett.    Who ambushed me with the phony chitchat about Mulder    And now you're following me.    What do you want to get on me, Agent Doggett?    You wouldn't know where to look.    I don't even know the question.    You think by talking in circles, I'm just going to get dizzy       You said it. I didn't.    You want me to go on record?  I will go on record to say this;    Then what are you doing here?    I don't know.       Skinner is telling the truth.    You think it was Mulder?    Two days ago?  By who? For what?       Mulder's mother is buried in Raleigh.    I don't know what to think.    What is it?       His temporal lobe.       Mulder was dying.    It's all right here.  For a year, he was going to doctors.    How far would he go for what?    It was his whole life.       You think that Mulder was here?    Please don't report that.    I think this is a waste of time.    I'm looking, and what I'm seeing is activity all over the    Mulder disappeared in the Pacific Northwest.       Here?  In the Arizona desert?    Okay. Say this is true ... then how do we even begin to    That's it.  It just came to me.    What you saw, why they took Mulder, why they're in Arizona    Why do people refuse to believe in aliens and UFOs after    Because, maybe, if there are aliens they're simply going    Because they are looking to find that which is not in my       How to start    Gibson Praise was last seen here at a power plant about    Well, according to this map... a whole lot of nothing.    Hi. Um ... we're looking for a boy named Gibson Praise.    What are you doing here?    It just came to me... why they took Mulder, why they're in Arizona.  They're    What are you doing here?       We live in a darkness of our own making... blind to a habitant    Where is he?  Where's Mulder?    You don't know?  I heard an agent say over the radio that you saw him.      It wasn't Mulder.    It may have looked like Mulder, but it wasn't Mulder.    I'm sure it did look like Mulder, and you have every reason to believe that it    You don't want to know.    He's alien.    He's a bounty hunter.    On Gibson Praise... because he's part alien.  He's a human anomaly.        To take him back to his ship... where we believe    Well then, you explain it to me.    I think that it is true.  And possible.  And wherever Mulder is right now... he    I don't know.  But he's going to turn this place upside down looking for the    Well, whatever happened to him, he's long gone.  Wherever he is, he's three    I'm here to protect you, Gibson.    I know you know that's the truth.  I know you know my thoughts.      The only reason they want to take you, Gibson … is    She has a right to be afraid.  We don't know who to trust now.    I think you might have broken it, Gibson.    I'm going to make you a splint, Gibson, okay?  I can set your leg, but, uh...       What?    From who?  From me?  Where?    Tell him to hold her.  Tell them not to let her out of his sight!    Hey!!    There she is.  Do you see her?    Where did she go?  Did you see her?    She ran right back here.  I saw her.    You saw her.    Agent...  Can you breathe?    He thinks it was me.  He thinks that I did this to him.    How    It's someone in this room.    Who are you?    Drop your weapon and turn around.    Just do it!  I know how it works-- kill shot to the back of the neck.    Turn around, or I'm going to assume that you're not who you say you are.       Okay...  then tell me.    No.  That's what's wrong here.  It hasn't gone far enough.  I need those car       Look, we are being hampered here by the FBI, by John    I-I can't take the chance that I'm never going to see him again.    Look... we've got one last chance here waiting for us out there in the desert--    Gibson!    I told him to stay here.  He was supposed to stay here.     Gibson!    Gibson.  What are you doing out here?  Why didn't you answer me, huh?       What are you talking about?    He's got a really bad fever.  I think his leg might be infected.    You take him to the hospital.    Mulder!    Mulder!    Oh, my god.    For someone who claims he's not following me, you sure have a knack.    What does that tell you?  That I'm crazy or that I'm right?    You say you want to find Mulder but you won't do what it takes.  You're    You've seen this crap for yourself now.  How do you explain what took    I know what Agent Mulder would do.  He'd do whatever it took.    Give a little, get a little, Agent Doggett.    What kid?  I don't see any kid.    How do you know that?    Your men... followed Assistant Director Skinner?    Your men are at the hospital?    How do you know that they're your men?    Where's the boy?    Are you certain about that?    Yeah, every minute that you wait, that boy's in danger.  He's exposed.    You believe that, Agent Doggett?       Hey, if something tries to rip your throat out, I    There's no one in that  room.    I'm looking for a patient, a boy, 12 years old.  He may still be in this    How did you get here?  How did you get him out of that room?    Where is he?    That supposed to cheer me up?    And you never will.  You still don't believe me.    Oh, it's just some things they have to check out... make sure of.    What are you doing here, Agent Doggett?    That's not your job.    FBI!    We're investigating a case!    We're investigating a case.    Mulder, what the hell is going on here?       Agent Mulder, can we have a word a second.    "What is it"?  Mulder, have you noticed that we're on television?    But it's a camera and it's recording.    It's recording everything that you are saying.  Do you understand    My point being, Mulder, that we're on a case.    Wh ...    Look, Mulder, you want to talk about werewolves to me you can    I don't want me looking foolish, Mulder.    I'm gonna call Skinner, Mulder.    I'm sure he's going to want to say a couple of words about this.    Guys, give it a rest, huh?    Well... those weren't teeth marks, Mulder.  They turned out to    Individual welts or stings of some sort.  Together, they just    He said that the FBI has nothing to hide... and neither do we.       Oh.  All right, good.    No.  You go with someone else.    Guys, watch out.  I'm a doctor.    Last call from this phone was made to the Road Club-- Ricky    What's that?    Somebody lost a nail.    Check out this color, Mulder-- blood red.    You didn't see his-his attacker?    So, you didn't see anything at all?    Did you, uh, did you see a woman?       Oh, yeah.    Bubblegum pink.    Don't run!  FBI.    FBI.  Chantara! Go...    Don't run.  It's okay.  It's okay.  It's all right.    Can I see your hands please?    May I see your hands, please?  It's okay.  Let me see your    Earlier this evening, a man was attacked.  He was badly slashed    You can tell us, Chantara.    Come on, Chantara.    "Mi novio"--  her boyfriend.    Chantara, no one's going to kill you.    Chuco Munoz, the man himself.  Only distinguishing feature is a    What do you mean?    Yeah, well, maybe not by himself but he's probably got friends, right?    Couple of days, maybe a week.  He didn't attack Ricky Koehler,    What is it, Mulder?  What?     Oh.    Where'd you find that?    Well, you did, that's correct.    Mulder, that's not exactly...     Okay, well, for the sake of this argument...    ...How would one catch something like that?    Chantara Gomez back to Wetzel.    But you're missing someone, Mulder.    Edy. Steve and Edy.   They're a part of this chain, too and, and       I'm sorry. Are you talking to me?    Steve, are you going to be all right?       Look, you guys, Steve, Edy.  The reason why we are    Think we should take them to a motel?    Oh, God.  More of you?    I'm afraid not.   Mulder, what next?    Well, I want to examine Chantara Gomez.    Your "contagion of fear"?    No.    But if I can't figure out what this thing was at least I can figure    Chantara Gomez, age 31, apparent cause of death is the fracturing    Well, let's see if we can put that story to rest, shall we?       That's... that's completely inaccurate.  This,       Look, this is obviously a murder, here.  I mean,   Nobody.  I just... I was, um... It was a figure of speech.      We're trying to look for the killer.       Because the FBI has nothing to hide.    Look, there is no ulterior motive here.  It's just...  Are you going    Thank you.    Look, I...    Call 911.  Call 911!  911!    Get out of here!  Come on!    It's not the hantavirus.  It looks for all the world like the hantavirus    Because she kept bringing it up.  I mean, it was like the power    No, no, no, Mulder.  I was standing right here.  I didn't see      The hell I wasn't afraid, Mulder.  I don't know what's    Mulder, you were walking around with him for three hours and    It's the battering ram.    Wind?    Damn it.  I hate you guys.    Deputy Wetzel?    He's alive.    We're up here!    You think the Deputy stopped it whatever it was?       You didn't get the proof that you       It's going to be a hard one to write up. I still don't get it. What does this have to do with us? Thank you. What happened here? What is it? Who's Barnett? What was the theory? Sort of? "Fox can't guard the chicken coop." So you never caught him? And what happened to Barnett? So you think he escaped? You're sure? Where's Mulder? He's got a clear shot. But he couldn't. Because it's not by the book. So, Mulder did shoot Barnett. Probably had a lot to do with the sentence the judge gave Barnett. What did Henderson come up with? What's that? Then it must be a very clever copycat. Pull any prints? Barnett had a lot of time on his hands while he was in prison, He planned to get you, didn't he? You did the right thing, Mulder. Sorry. This was just faxed. I just got off the phone with the prison. No, I called them on a hunch. John Barnett died of a heart attack, He left you everything he had in his will. You must've known On his death certificate. What doctor? How could you tell Barnett wasn't dead? What are you going to do? You mean the ghost of John Barnett. Hello? Yeah, just a minute. All right, all right... You lost him. Was it Barnett? What did he mean by that? I hope you guys brought your fine-toothed comb. I want every I'm sorry. Mulder... we're still not a hundred percent sure that this is I was just trying to find you. Listen to this. According to His membership expired and wasn't renowed after the state of Right here. In the federal journal for the National Institute He was conducting experiments on young children afflicted with But fatal. So, how did Doctor Ridley eventually lose his medical license? I'm afraid your colleague, Doctor Ridley, has dropped off the You just don't reverse aging. Listen to what you're saying. Mulder, it's science fiction. Ridley's notes from the human trials at N.I.H. indicate he didn't Who is it? The same disease that kills the kids suffering from progeria? But how? The material that insulates neurons in the body. I, I'm afraid to ask. What kind of hand did you grow? Unbelievable. Because you knew that if your theories panned out... It's my private answering machine. Or at least it used to be. When I ran from the shower this morning, I heard someone dialing This morning, I took this down to prints before I came here. Uh, that my mother called for no reason and I'm meeting a friend I'm including a diagram of the theater. You have six front entrances It's the first time I've ever played the target. Gun! Like somebody kicked me in the ribs. What about him? Is Barnett conscious? Mulder, I know what you did wasn't by the book. They lost him. Where do you think it is? If it didn't destroy it, chances are that somehow, someday,
