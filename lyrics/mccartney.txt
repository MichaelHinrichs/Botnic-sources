And I will lose my mind
If you won't see me.

Should want to hide.
But I can't get through.
My hands are tied.
I won't want to stay.
I don't have much to say
And I can turn away
And you won't see me.
You won't see me. Time after time
You refuse to even listen.
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing. Though the days are few
They're filled with tears.
And since I lost you,
It feels like years.

If you won't see me.
You won't see me.
Yeah. I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life? You didn't run, you didn't lie
You know I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day Got to get you into my life What can I do? What can I be?
When I'm with you I wanna stay there
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life? Got to get you into my life
I've got to get you into my life I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
And then I suddenly see you
Did I tell you I need you
Every single day? Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing a face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for? All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong? Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no-one will hear
No-one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care? All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong? Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No-one was saved
All the lonely people 
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people 
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Where do they all belong? Your day breaks
Your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you
She wakes up She makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
You want her
You need her And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one A love that should have lasted years
You stay home
She goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone But now he's gone
She doesn't need him
Your day breaks
Your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said
Will fill your head
You won't forget her
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine And our friends are all on board
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine 
Full speed ahead Mr. Boatswain, full speed ahead
Full speed ahead it is, Sgt.
Cut the cable, drop the cable
Yeah, yeah, Sir, yeah, yeah
Captain, captain
As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us has all we need
One of us, has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
Sky of blue, sea of green
In our yellow submarine
In our yellow, submarine, aha
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine I need to laugh
And when the sun is out
I've got something I can laugh about
I feel good In a special way
I'm in love and it's a sunny day
Good day sunshine Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine We take a walk
The sun is shining down
Burns my feet as they touch the ground Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Then we lie Beneath a shady tree
I love her and she's loving me
She feels good she feels good
She knows she's looking fine
I'm so proud to know that she is mine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine
Good day sunshine

To lead a better life
I need my love to be here Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
I will be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere When I get older
Losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a Valentine?
Birthday greetings bottle of wine? If I'd been out
Till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me
Will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four? You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you I could be handy
Mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride Doing the garden
Digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me
Will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four? Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save we shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave Send me a postcard
Drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely wasting away
Give me your answer
Fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me
Will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four? I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
I'm filling the cracks that ran though the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong
I'm right where I belong
I'm right where I belong
See the people standing there
Who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door I'm painting the room in a colourful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh-ooh oh ah ohh
Hey! Hey!
Hey
Hey And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong
I'm right where I belong
I'm right where I belong
Silly people run around
They worry me and never ask me
Why they don't get past my door I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
Ooh-ooh oh ah ohh I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
Where it will go
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go Ahhhh!
Ahh! ahhhh!
Ahhhhhhh!

Ahh!
Lovely Rita
Meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by
A parking meter
When I caught
A glimpse of Rita
Filling in the ticket in her little white book
In a cap
She looked much older
And the bag
Across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man
Lovely Rita
Meter maid
May I inquire discreetly, 
Lovely Rita
When are you free to take some tea with me? 
Lovely meter maid
Ai

Aid
Ahhhh!
Ah! ahh!
Rita!
Woo, woo!
Woo, hoo!
Took her out
And tried to win her
Had a laugh
And over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill
And Rita paid it
Took her home
And nearly made it
Sitting on a sofa with a sister or two
Oh!
Lovely Rita
Meter maid
Where would I be without you?
Give us a wink and make me think of
You, Lovely

Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene

But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon Didn't anybody tell her?

Phase One, in which Doris gets her oats Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's hard-earned pay
You and me Sunday driving
Not arriving
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters on my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home You and I have memories
Longer than the road
That stretches out ahead Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home You and I have memories
Longer than the road
That stretches out ahead Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo in the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere
On our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home We're going home
Better believe it
Goodbye When I find myself in times of trouble

And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be And when the broken-hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be Let it be, let it be

There is still a light that shines on me
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music,
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be

Paperback writer In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain
Very strange Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Here beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back in Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
For a fish and finger pie
In summer meanwhile back Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane You say yes, I say no

Day after day, alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round Ohh oh-oh-oh-oh ohh-oh-oh
Round and round and round and round and round
He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fool
They don't like him The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Ohhhh
Round and round and round and round and
Ohhhh Blackbird singing in the dead of night

I got blisters on my fingers! Born a poor young country boy, Mother Nature's son
All day long I'm sitting singing songs for everyone Sit beside a mountain stream, see her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies Find me in my field of grass, Mother Nature's son
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun 
Wah, Mother Nature's son john: he was a fool unto himself rocky raccoon.
now rocky raccoon he was a fool unto himself,
and he would not swallow his foolish pride.
mind you, coming from a little town in minnesota,
it was not the kind of thing that a young guy did when
a fellow went and stole his chick away from him.
now rocky raccoon checked into his room
only to find gideon's bible.
rocky had come equipped with a gun
to shoot off the legs of his rival.
his rival it seems had broken his dreams
by stealing the girl of his fancy.
her name was magill, and she called herself lil,
but everyone knew her as nancy. now she and her man, who called himself dan,
were in the next room at the hoedown.
and rocky burst in and grinning a grin,
said, danny boy, this is a showdown.
but daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
and rocky collapsed in the corner
ah. da da da,
da da da,
da,
do do do do do do. da da da,
da da da,
da,
do do do do do do. the doctor walked in, sminking of gin sminking?
proceeded to lie on the table.
he's really sminking of gin,
and it did him in the end, poor doc.
meantime, back on the table, yeah,
the doctor said, rock, you've met your match, son.
rocky said, it's only a scratch, so i'll be better soon.
you better be better soon, said the doc.
come on, son, gotta get hip, gotta get up, gotta get back
to your gun, gotta go and shoot that danny boy. however, rocky raccoon, he fell back in his room
only to find gideon's bible.
gideon checked out and left it no doubt
to help with good rocky's revival - ah. da da da,
da da da,
da,
do do do do do do. do do do,
do do do,
do do
and that's the story of the rocky raccoon, yeah. hey! Honey pie, honey pie Honey pie, honey pie Honey pie, honey pie

I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh, you know I will
I will Wednesday morning at five o clock
As the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more She goes down the stairs to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free She, we gave her most of our lives
Is leaving sacrified most of our lives
Home we gave her everything money could buy
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy, our baby's gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me? She we never thought of ourselves
Is leaving never a thought for ourselves
Home we struggled hard all our lives to get by
She's leaving home, after living alone, for so many years Friday morning, at nine o clock
She is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Greeting a man from the Motortrade She what did we do that was wrong
Is Having we didn't know it was wrong
Fun fun is the one thing that money can't buy
Something inside, that was always denied,
for so many years,
She's leaving home Billy Shears! What would you think if I sang out of tune
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends What do I do when my love is away?

Are you sad because you're on your own?
No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mm, gonna try with a little help from my friends 
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
