Girl I love you but your loving has gone forever
Gonna miss you but my love has gone forever
I say I love you but your loving has gone forever
Gonna miss you but my love has gone forever

Girl I'm back in Spanish, ain't no trouble coming around
You promise you will never let me down
If you love me that much you will stick around

It's hard to tell that your love exist
But I know this one is for real

Girl I love you but your loving has gone forever
Forever


You've got me walking upon air
And I'm afraid of heights
You fill my days with thoughts of you
Then rob my sleep at night
I see another side of me
When you come into view
I hate the way I love you
But I do

I hate the way I miss you
Every time you're not around
And the way you've got me thinking
It's time to settle down
I tried to fight the feeling
But this time there's no use
I hate the way I love you
But I do

I always used to pride myself
I never lost control
When I felt I was in too deep
I'd pack my heart and go
Now I fall all to pieces
At the thought of losing you
I hate the way I love you
But I do

I hate the way I miss you
Every time you're not around
And the way you've got me thinking
It's time to settle down
I tried to fight the feeling
But this time there's no use
I hate the way I love you
But I do

I tried to fight the feeling
But this time there's no use
I hate the way I love you
But I do

Oh I hate the way I love you
But I do


It's crazy how that four letter word gets tossed
And I'm guilty, said it so many times before
But I can't front no more

You're the only one that's showing me the real
You're the only one that's giving me these chills
No ex in the past could open up my eyes
Thought I found the one every time

I've said I love you, but I lied
Cause love never got me this high
I've said I love you, but I lied
Cause everything's different this time, oh no

I've said I love you, but I lied
Cause love never got me this high

It'd be foolish if they thought they could get me back
See, the truth is you can't lose what you never had
And you got me so bad

You're the only one that's showing me the thrill
You're the only one that's giving me these chills
No ex in the past could open up my eyes
Thought I found the one every time

I've said I love you, but I lied
Cause love never got me this high
I've said I love you, but I lied
Cause everything's different this time, oh no

I've said I love you, but I lied
Cause love never got me this high

You got that real love
That text in the morning, that real love
How Mary J call it, that real love
We got real love
You got that real love
That text in the morning, that real love
How Mary J call it, that real love
We got real love

I've said I love you, but I lied
Cause love never got me this high
I've said I love you, but I lied
Cause love never got me this high

You got my love, talking bout real love
I've said I love you, but I lied
Cause love never got me this high

You got that real love
That text in the morning, that real love
How Mary J call it, that real love
We got real love
You got that real love
That text in the morning, that real love
How Mary J call it, that real love
We got real love


If I see you tomorrow on some street in town
Pardon me if I don't say Hello
I belong to another, and it doesn't look so good
To know someone I'm not supposed to know

Just a walk on by, wait on the corner
I love you but we're strangers when we meet
Just a walk on by, wait on the corner
I love you but we're strangers when we meet

In a dimly lit corner at a place outside of town
Tonight we'll try to say Goodbye again
But I know it's not over, I'll call tomorrow night
I can't let you go so why pretend?

Just a walk on by, wait on the corner
I love you but we're strangers when we meet
Just a walk on by, wait on the corner
I love you but we're strangers when we meet

If you see me walking down the street
I got nothing but love for you
Even if you're trying to diss me
I got nothing but love for you
It don't matter if I'm riding high or low
I got nothing but love for you
No matter where I'm about to go


I got nothing but love for you
I got nothing but love for you
I got nothing but love for you
I got nothing but love for you
I got nothing but love for you

You may have a different point of view
I got nothing but love for you
I don't care if it ain't the same to me
I got nothing but love for you
If I see you riding high and low
I got nothing but love for you
It don't matter what you say or do

I got nothing but love for you
I got nothing but love for you
I got nothing but love for you
I got nothing but love for you
I got nothing but love for you

I got nothing but love for you
I got nothing but love for you

She walked to his car from the church house
Where he sat waiting in the night
And her hands trembled on her Bible
As she held on firmly to the right

Oh, you're beggin me to go out drinkin
But drinkin only adds to my pain
I love you sweetheart, I love you
But we won't ever meet again

Oh, I love you sweetheart, I love you
And your tears keep addin to my pain
I love you sweetheart, I love you
But we won't ever meet again

Oh, my heart is almost broken
And then she let go of his hand
I love you sweetheart, I love you
But we won't ever meet again

You've been in the arms of another
And one who says she is my friend
You've kissed her and held her and loved her
And taken her places that we've been

Oh, my heart is almost broken
And then she let go of his hand
I love you sweetheart, I love you
But we won't ever meet again

Oh, I love you sweetheart, I love you
But drinkin only adds to my pain
I love you sweetheart, I love you
But we won't ever meet again

Oh, my heart is almost broken
And your tears only add to my pain
I love you sweetheart, I love you
But we won't ever meet again


I don't know why I love you but I do
I don't know why I cry so, but I do
I only know I'm lonely
And that I want you only
I don't know why I love you but I do
I can't sleep nights because I feel so restless
I don't know what to do~ I feel so helpless
And since you've been away
I cry both night and day

I don't know why I love you but I do
My days have been so lonely
My nights have been so blue
I don't know how I stand it, but I do
Each night I sit alone and tell myself
That I will fall in love with someone else
I guess I'm wastin time
But I've got to clear my mind
I don't know why I love you but I do
I don't know why I love you but I do

You say you want it all
I feel it half the time
I'm still trying to find myself
You make me lose my mind

I can't focus when you're with me
I can't sleep when I'm alone
In this half life that I'm living
I love you but I gotta let go, XO, XO
I love you but I gotta let go, XO, XO
I love you but I gotta let go XO

I want to call you back
I don't know what to say
I'm scared to open up
Why do I act this way

I can't focus when you're with me
I can't sleep when I'm alone
In this half life that I'm living
I love you but I gotta let go, XO, XO
I love you but I gotta let go, XO, XO
I love you but I gotta let go, XO

I can't focus when you're with me
I can't sleep when I'm alone
In this half life that I'm living
I love you but I gotta let go, XO, XO
I love you but I gotta let go, XO, XO
I love you but I gotta let go, XO


I lost my leg like I lost my way
So no loose ends
Nothing to see me down
How are we going to work this out

Dreams aren't bad, I had turned back
I love the girl
But God only knows it's
Getting hard to see the sun coming through
I love you
But what are we going to do

Picture on the dreamer
I'll take you deeper
Down to the sleepy glow
Time is a low
Don't you know
What are we going to do

When you go back
All the second selfless days
You're in love with him
I want to see you again
I love you
But what are we going to do


Honey, I think Audrey's a little mature for you 
No I don't think she's mature I think she's nice
Hey mom when are we going
Look mama I Love you
But you gotta let me live my life
Look mama I Love you 
But you gotta let me live my life

Don't wrap me up in cotton wool
You can't treat me like a fool
Anyway if I was, you gotta let me be one
OK give me your advice
It's not my fault if I can't be wise
Show me a person who hasn't been done

Look mama I Love you
But you gotta let me live my life
Look mama I Love you
But you gotta let me live my life

Don't try to stick your rules on me
I wasn't born as a carbon copy
I came out of you
But don't think that you own me
I have my respect for you
I won't try to change the things you do
Give me a break
Let me learn it my way
You think you know more than me
Experience hasn't set you free

Look mama I Love you
Look mama, look, look mama, look
Look mama I Love you
Loom mama, look, look mama, look

I gotta make my own mistakes
Why can't you treat me like a friend

Look mama I Love you 
But you gotta let me live my life
Look mama I Love you
But you gotta let me live my life

Look mama I Love you
Look mama, look, look mama, look
Look mama, look


you know i love you but you got me doin time
you say i'm guilty all the time i didn't do 

i stayed in solitary so long
till i almost forgot my name
bread and water is all they gave me
woman you know you are to blame

i don't mind the punishment
if i had been guilty of the crime
didn't mind the punishment baby
if i had been guilty of the crime
Ten years of grief and torutre cause me to lose my mind


It's not supposed to be that way 
You're supposed to know I love you
But it don't matter anyway 
If I can't be there to control you
Like the other little children why
You're gonna dream a dream or two
But be careful what you're dreamin
Or soon your dreams will be dreamin you
It's not supposed to be that way 
You're supposed to know I love you
But it don't matter anyway 
If I can't be there to console you
When you go out to play this evenin
Play with fire flies till they're gone
Then you rush to meet your lover 
And play with real fire till the dawn
But it's not supposed to be that way 
You're supposed to know I love you
But it don't matter anyway 
If I can't be there to console you

When you go out to play this evenin
Play with fire flies till they're gone
Then you rush to meet your lover 
And play with real fire till the dawn
But it's not supposed to be that way 
You're supposed to know I love you
But it don't matter anyway 
If I can't be there to console you


New york, I love you
But you're bringing me down

New york, I love you
But you're bringing me down

Like a rat in a cage
Pulling minimum wage

New york, I love you
But you're bringing me down

New york, you're safer
And you're wasting my time

Our records all show
You are filthy but fine

But they shuttered your stores
When you opened the doors
To the cops who were bored
Once they'd run out of crime

New york, you're perfect
Don't please don't change a thing

Your mild billionaire mayor's
Now convinced he's a king

So the boring collect
I mean all disrespect

In the neighborhood bars
I'd once dreamt I would drink

New york, I love you
But you're freaking me out

There's a ton of the twist
But we're fresh out of shout

Like a death in the hall
That you hear through your wall

New york, I love you
But you're freaking me out

New york, I love you
But you're bringing me down

New york, I love you
But you're bringing me down

Like a death of the heart
Jesus, where do I start? 

But you're still the one pool
Where I'd happily drown

And oh. take me off your mailing list
For kids that think it still exists
Yes, for those who think it still exists

Maybe I'm wrong
And maybe you're right
Maybe I'm wrong
And myabe you're right

Maybe you're right
Maybe I'm wrong
And just maybe you're right

And oh.
Maybe mother told you true
And they're always be something there for you
And you'll never be alone

But maybe she's wrong
And maybe I'm right
And just maybe she's wrong

Maybe she's wrong
And maybe I'm right
And if so, is there?


I love my dog as much as I love you
But you may fade, my dog will always come through

All he asks from me is the food to give him strength
All he ever needs is love and that he knows he'll get

So, I love my dog as much as I love you
But you may fade, my dog will always come through

All the pay I need comes a-shinin through his eyes
I don't need no cold water to make me realize that

I love my dog as much as I love you
But you may fade, my dog will always come through

Na, na, na, na, na, na, nana
Na, na, na, na, na, na, nana

I love my dog as much as I love you
But you may fade, my dog will always come through

Na, na, na, na, na, na, nana
Na, na, na, na, na, na, nana

I love my dog, baby, I love my dog
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na,na
I said, I love my dog, baby, I love my dog
Baby, I love my dog


I drew my name in lipstick on a mirror at your sister's house
She told me I was strange, I told her, Thanks, and kissed her on the mouth
But you don't go that way
I thought you had a thing for fancy boys
Looks can be deceiving

I love you
But I hate your friends
They're all desperate
If you knew what I know would you be ready to go?
All this emptiness would end
Stop pretending
If you knew what I know would you be ready to go?
Would you be ready to go?

They never liked the music
They bitch about how cool it used to be
Somehow I can't refuse it
I dig your blatant sexuality
Oh you say I'm not that easy
I'm not sure what the hell you take me for
Honey, looks can be deceiving

I love you
But I hate your friends
They're all desperate
If you knew what I know would you be ready to go?
All this emptiness would end
Stop pretending
If you knew what I know would you be ready to go?
Would you be ready to go?

They're always on to the next big thing
They wanna bite but they can barely sting
I never wanted you for just a fling
I hate it when you lie to me
But I just let you lie to me

I love you
But I hate your friends
They're all desperate
If you knew what I know would you be ready to go?
All this emptiness would end
Stop pretending
If you knew what I know would you be ready to go?
Would you be ready to go?

I love you
I love you
I love you
But I hate your friends

I love you
I love you
I love you
But I hate your friends


You only know what I want you to
I know everything you don't want me to
Oh your mouth is poison, your mouth is wine
You think your dreams are the same as mine
Oh I don't love you but I always will
Oh I don't love you but I always will
Oh I don't love you but I always will
I always will

I wish you'd hold me when I turn my back
The less I give the more I get back
Oh your hands can heal, your hands can bruise
I don't have a choice but I'd still choose you

Oh I don't love you but I always will
Oh I don't love you but I always will
Oh I don't love you but I always will
Oh I don't love you but I always will
Oh I don't love you but I always will
Oh I don't love you but I always will
Oh I don't love you but I always will

I always will
I always will
I always will
I always will
I always will


She's on another planet
She's in my dream
She's some kind of angel
If you know what I mean
Try her on
She fits like a glove
Too bad she only thinks about
The lord above

Evangeline Evangeline
I think I love you
But Evangeline Evangeline
I want you

Now if I called you up
Do you think you 
Could deliver my soul?
Won't you take a drink
Little darlin
The cup is full

And every night I bow to pray
But I'll feel a whole lot better
Once you're coming my way

Evangeline Evangeline
I think I love you
But Evangeline Evangeline
I want you

So come on down

So tell me how you want it
Come on, tell me how you want it
Just tell me how you want it

Just tell me how you want it
We won't be seen
You can tell your father
It was all a dream
try her on she fits like a glove
Too bad the only man you trust
Is god above

Evangeline Evangeline
I think I love you
But Evangeline Evangeline
I want you

Now Evangeline Evangeline
I think I love you
But Evangeline Evangeline
I want you

She's some kind of angel
If you know what I mean
Evangeline


Rolling,
I could tell from the moment you walked in the room
That it wasn't your dress you had on
That wasn't your perfume
And what happened to the ring that I gave you?
What am I to assume?
I love you, but I don't trust you anymore

You could tell from the moment you looked in my eyes
That I could see right through you
You must apologize
I've always given you the best in life
Even in the wrong, it was right
I know you trust me, but you don't love me anymore, no no

I remember meeting you here in the good ol days
I would never pick the flower of my favorite protege
Maybe if I would have
Then you would not treat me this way
You tricked me, but you will not anymore, no no
I love you, but I don't trust you anymore


All that time I was searching, nowhere to run to, it started me thinking,
Wondering what I could make of my life, who'd be waiting,
Asking all kinds of questions, to myself, but never finding the answers,
Crying at the top of my voice, no one listening,
All this time, I still remember everything you said
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget.

Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.

So listen, listen to me,
You must believe me,
I can feel your eyes go through me,
But I don't know why.

I know you're going, but I can't believe it's the way that you're leaving,
It's like we never knew each other at all, it may be my fault,
I gave you too many reasons, being alone, when I didn't want to
I thought you'd always be there, I almost believed you,
All this time, I still remember everything you said,
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget.

Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.

So listen, listen to me,
I can feel your eyes go through me

It seems I've spent too long
Only thinking about myself
Now I want to spend my life
Just caring bout somebody else.

Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.


Sailor, I love you
But you only love the sea
Sailor, what's happening to me
Like a ship in a bottle
You ache for the sea
Sailor, ache a little for me
I'll haunt every harbour
Till the sea decides
If our loves goes in or out with the tide
I'll still be here when the ocean's dried
Oh, Sailor, you're still my man
Sailor, I love you
But you only love the sea
Sailor, why don't you love me


No chance I could be her boyfriend
I'm trying to flip butch girls again
We could see what life pretends
And why don't I still call a friend?

She says, you know I love you, but I feel so one in ten.

And life is short and dull
Categorize to the full, until the charm is gone.
And you're a big girl, if you wanna get it on, you will
And if you don't, you won't

She says, you know I love you, but I feel so one in ten.

You could have such a life, with me
You could knit baby sweaters, 
We could watch the flat screen t.v.

She says, you know I love you, but I feel so one in ten.

What's the differences, when it goes down?
If it's a girl, or if it's guys?
Can't you just close your eyes?
Baby, close your eyes.
Baby, close your eyes.

Love doesn't come in perfect packages, that means I qualify.
And I know it's not your way, but I thought we could give it a try.

She says, you know I love you, but I feel so one in ten.
You know I love you, but I feel so one in ten.
You know I love you, she'll always be my one in ten.


Once I used to turn away
I never hear a word you'd say
Suddenly your words run true

I started to believe in you
Now I love you but you are gone
There's nothing left to build upon
In a world I never know

I thought I could depend on you for love
Come to you for love

You could make a day for me
Seem like a year of ecstasy
Every moment spent apart
Was like a sword thrust through my heart

I thought our love would grow and grow
But all that seems so long ago
Were you just to blind to see that
You were more than life to me

For what good am I?


I hate you,
When I see you on the street,
Acting hard, thinking on your feet,
Treating me like some piece of meat.

I forgive you, the things you do, forgive me too.

I love you,
But nothing I can say will change,
If you admit you feel the same,
Did you just ask me why I'm acting strange.

I forgive you, the things you do, forgive me too.


To make you stay I'll never try 
And when you go I will not cry
But for a time I might be found somewhere live still around
But may you find a love that's true
Someone to love and cherish you
And if you love your whole life through 
And may you love as I love you
But if you'll ever feel alone 
With no true love to call your own
And if you'll need a place to hide 
These arms of mine are open wide
And if a troubled love brings you pain 
My love is all like summer rain
Always remember I'll be found still around

To make you stay I'll never try 
And when you go I will not cry
But for a time I might be found somewhere live still around
But may you find a love that's true
Someone to love and cherish you
And if you love your whole life through 
And may you love as I love you
But if you'll ever feel alone 
With no true love to call your own
And if you'll need a place to hide 
These arms of mine are open wide
And if a troubled love brings you pain 
My love is all like summer rain
Always remember I'll be found still around


Joanna
I can't forget the one they call Joanna
We owned the summer, hand in hand Joanna
And now she's always just a tear away
Goodbye you, you long lost summer
Leaving me behind you
Revealing things for lovers that may find you
I still hang on to every word that day, you passed my way
Joanna
You made the man a child again, so sweetly
He breathed your smile
Lived in your eyes completely
And on his heart there's still a trace of you
I love you but nothing in this world could make you mine
Yet still in time
Joanna
Joanna, you may remember me and change your mind

I love you but nothing in this world could make you mine
Yet still in time
Joanna
Joanna, you may remember me and change your mind


You said you was hurting,
Almost lost your mind,
And the man you love,
He hurts you all the time.

When things go wrong,
Go wrong with you,
It hurts me, too.

You love him more
When you should love him less.
I pick up behind him
And take his mess.

He love another woman
And I love you,
But you love him
And stick to him like glue.

Now you better leave him;
He better put you down.
Oh, I won't stand
To see you pushed around.


The sun shines through my bedroom window
Like a long lost friend
And I can't describe how good it feels to
See him back again

If I were a tender poet
Maybe I could speak
All those lines and perfect phrases
Just beyond my reach

And I'd like to say what's in my heart
But I don't have the nerve
And I'd tell you that I love you
But I just can't find the words

Maybe I could paint a picture
And let the colors show
All I've been keeping to myself yet want
The world to know

Or maybe I could write a letter and keep
It short and sweet
No greeting card type sentiment, just
What you mean to me

And I'd like to say what's in my heart
But I don't have the nerve
And I'd tell you that I love you
But I just can't find the words


I put a spell on you
Because you're mine

You better stop the things you do
Cause, honey, I ain't lyin
No I ain't lyin

You know I can't stand it
You're runnin around
You know better baby
I can't stand the way you put me down

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
Oh, I'd better for you

You know I love you
I love you
I love you anyhow, baby
You know I love you
I love you
But I don't care
I'm yours right now

You see honey
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine

Because you are mine


I want you
I need you
I love you, girl
With all my heart

I want you
I need you
I love you, girl
I love you

But you don't want me
You don't need me
You don't love me
You don't please me
You don't care for me and walk away
That's what you do


Ohhhohhhh Yeah
Ooooh
Oohohh

Remember we'd be up all night
Talking til the morning light, yeah
Like the way it used to be
Those simple days
Just you and me, mmmm

I think baby I know
What's on your mind
Cause you look like you've
Got something to say

I may not say those words anymore
But maybe it just ain't my way

You ask me do I love you but
Do you remember
Why I walked on water for you
Do you remember
My first steps on the moon
Have you ever wondered why
I gave three wishes to you
You asked the question
But the answer lies
In you, in you
The answer lies in you

Remember we used to laugh and say
No one else could get in our way
And there were times
When you would cry
And came knocking
On my door
And I was there
To shelter your pain

I think baby you should
Get that off your mind
Make it seem like
A brighter day

I may not say those words anymore
But maybe I can make it my way

You ask me do I love you but
Do you remember
Why I walked on water for you
Do you remember
My first steps on the moon
Have you ever wondered why
I gave three wishes to you
You asked the question
But the answer lies
In you, in you
The answer lies in you

The answer girl
Lies within your heart
Take a look inside

You ask me do I love you but
Do you remember
Why I walked on water for you
Do you remember
My first steps on the moon
Have you ever wondered why
I gave three wishes to you
You asked the question
But the answer lies
In you, in you
The answer lies in you

In you, in you
The answer lies in you

In you, in you
The answer lies in you

In you, in you
The answer lies in you, yeah


I wish that I could love you
But I don't know how to love you
There's no one here to blame
So you can charge it to the game
But I really wanna love you
But I don't know how to love you

I was tryna be the different one
That will give you the kind of love that a woman wants
It's so unusual for me to feel this way
Cause I like to play the field
Baby this is what it is
I'm caught up, aye
Maybe one day it will change
Only if you choose to stay
But now all I can say

Is I wish that I could love you
But I don't know how to love you
There's no one here to blame
So you can charge it to the game
But I really wanna love you
But I don't know how to love you

Girl I know you've been hurt many times before
And relationships appear from love and war
You can act as if it doesn't exist
But it does
Admit it face to face
Girl, I'm in a different place
Is it worth it?
I don't wanna let you go
But there's something you should know
How can I get this through to you?

I wish that I could love you
But I don't know how to love you
There's no one here to blame
So you can charge it to the game
But I really wanna love you
But I don't know how to love you

I'm not the faithful type of guy, can't help it
I want your cake and some of hers, I'm so selfish girl
I know you're sick of all my games in my book
I understand how you feel

I wish that I could love you
But I don't know how to love you 
Love you baby
There's no one here to blame
So you can charge it to the game
But I really wanna love you
But I don't know how to love you

I really wanna love you yea


I used to love you but it's all over,
All over now!
You know it's all over town
That you turned me down,
But you shouldn't let that kind of story go round!

For you had your chance but now it's all over,
I'll get along somehow!
Now there are things that you did
I used to forgive,
I used to love you but it's all over,
All over now!
But you'll never change just as long as you live!
I used to love you but it's all over,
All over now!


The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
Oh I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
Do you know that I hung my
Oh my head and I cried

Oh you are my sunshine, my only sunshine
Girl, you make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never never never know, how much I love you
But don't you to take my sunshine away

You told me once, dear, that you really loved me
And no one else could ever come between
But not you've left me and you love another
And you have shattered all my dreams

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never never never know dear, how much I love you
But don't you to take

If you love me
If you need me
If you want me

I don't want you to take
I don't want you to take
My sunshine away


How can I tell you 
That I love you
I love you 
But I can't think of right words to say 

I long to tell you 
That I'm always thinking of you
I'm always thinking of you
But my words just blow away
Just blow away 

It always ends up to one thing, honey 
And I can't think of right words to say 

Wherever I am girl
I'm always walking with you 
I'm always walking with you
But I look and you're not there 

Whoever I'm with
I'm always, always talking to you 
I'm always talking to you
And I'm sad that you can't hear
Sad that you can't hear 

It always ends up to one thing, honey
When I look and you're not there 

I need to know you
Need to feel my arms around you 
Feel my arms around you
Like a sea around a shore 

Each night and day I pray
In hope that I might find you
In hope that I might find you
Because heart's can do no more
Can do no more

It always ends up to one thing, honey
Still I kneel upon the floor 

How can I tell you 
That I love you
I love you 
But I can't think of right words to say 

I long to tell you 
That I'm always thinking of you 
I'm always thinking of you

It always ends up to one thing, honey 
And I can't think of right words to say


Everybody says I love you
But not everybody lives I love you
Without our past
How will we know it's us?
Love is not enought

I could have hugged you more carefully
And I suppose you could have been there for me
But then again
They say it's meant to be
But love
Is not enough

Choosing not to remember
Is no way to forget
That's just a losing bet
It's so unjust
When love is not enough

These old streets of shame
Will they ever look the same?
Will they remember our name?
Just ask the dust
Love's not enough


Cheatin

Baby you know I love you
But I cannot stand the things you do
That's the truth baby
I cannot stand the things you do
Yeah you been cheatin on for me
But somebody goes cheat on you
I need you baby can't you see
So please give all your love to me
Oh baby please give all your love to me
Yeah you been cheatin on for me
But somebody goes cheat on you

I need you baby can't you see
So please come and go with me
Oh wee baby baby come and go with me
Yes you been cheatin on for me
But that's the way it seems to be


When I'm sitting so close to you
There's only one thing that I wanna do
But I know what you're likely to say
That I'm going about it the wrong way

We can't agree about anything
Where to go or even where we've been
And I know what you're likely to do
Say that I've never care about you

And all I wanted to say was that I love you
But you tell me now you don't believe it's true
You got a different, a different
A different point of view
You got a different
Point of view

You don't believe a single word I say
If I'd say black was white, you'd say it was grey
But in spite of been treated this way
I still dream of you all night and day

And all I wanted to say was that I love you
But you tell me now you don't believe it's true
You got a different, a different
A different point of view
You got a different
Point of view

Just this once
Just say yes
Please

You've got a clever way of haunting me
I'm never scared, but you're still daunting me
Cause I know what you're likely to say
And I know that you'll get your own way

And all I wanted to say was that I love you
But you tell me now you don't believe it's true
You got a different, a different
A different point of view
You got a different
Point of view

You got a different, a different
A different point of view
You got a different
Point of view


I call her Firerefly
Cause, oh, my
She radiates moon glow
Wants none of that noon glow
She starts to glitter
When the sun goes down

Bout eight pm, it's mayhem
She switches those brights up
Lights up and gives me a call
Take me to the fireflies ball

But when I get her there
Set her there
Do I get to pet her there
And grab me some glow

No, she's a gad about, mad about
Luring every lad about
While leaving me moaning low

Oh, Firefly, why can't I
Latch onto you no how
Oh, how I love you but gee
While you set the night on
Firefly, shine a little light on me

But when I get her there
Set her there
Do I get to pet her there
And grab me some glow

No, she's a gad about, mad about
Luring every lad about
While leaving me moaning low

Oh, Firefly, why can't I
Latch on for you no how
Oh, how I love you but gee
While you set the night on
Firefly, shine a little light on
Shine a little light on
Shine a little light on me


Have you ever caught a smile
That you know you'd always love it
See, even if it vomits bile
So you'd only miss it

It turns upside down and cries
And you just want to kiss it
I get the feeling from your eyes
No, no, this time you won't dismiss it

From a seven storey building
I think of you 
oh oh oh
Obsessive minds like mine
Are speed dialing you

And fragments of your face
Race around my lonely place
And I jump for you

So got no time to waste
Cause I promised I would constantly love you
Until the day I die
I promised I would constantly love you
Until the end of time
Promised I would constantly love you
Until the day I die
I promised I would constantly love you

I need you in sickness
I need you in health
I need you on my guest list
I need you by myself

So be apart forever
So baby boy, you're mine
But nothing lasts forever
So instead I'll take my life

Got no time to waste
Cause there's no smile here
Cause there's no smile here

Cause I promised I would constantly love you
Until the day I die
I promised I would constantly love you
Until the end of time
Promised I would constantly love you
Until the day I die
I promised I would constantly love you

I love you but there's no smile here 
I love you but there's no smile here 
I love you but there's no smile here 
I love you but there's no smile

I love you but there's no smile here
I love you but there's no smile here 
I love you but there's no smile here 
No smile tomorrow

Cause I promised I would constantly love you
Until the day I die
I promised I would constantly love you
Until the end of time
Promised I would constantly love you
Until the day I die
I promised I would constantly love you


Wild thing, you make my heart sing
You make everything groovy, wild thing
Wild thing, I think I love you
But I wanna know for sure
Come on and hold me tight
I love you

Wild thing, you make my heart sing
You make everything groovy, wild thing
Wild thing, I think you move me
But I wanna know for sure
Come on and hold me tight
You move me

Wild thing, you make my heart sing
You make everything groovy, wild thing
Wild thing, you make my heart sing
You make everything groovy, wild thing
Wild thing, you make my heart sing
You make everything groovy, wild thing


Here today and gone tomorrow our love would always be a hit'n run affair
I know you love me but I'm just a wanderer
Today I love you but tomorrow I may not care
For absence always makes the hearts grow fonder
I get lonesome for someone's company
You're here today and gone tomorrow and my loving you is just a fantasy

When you're gone I wish we'd never met for the memory remains within my heart
You're here today and gone tomorrow we can't be happy so I think it's best we part
For absence always makes


Gone away
Who knows where you been
But you take all your lies
And wish them all away

I somehow doubt
We'll ever be the same
There's too much poison
And confusion on your face

Can you feel it?
I didn't mean it
Can I see you?
What are we doin?
I think I love you
But I ain't sayin
Nothin you don't know

Hold on dreamaway
You're my sweet charade

Take your time
Move yourself to me
Yeah, I can take your lies
Until you fall away

You know I'm lost
Hiding in your bed
No, I don't think it's wrong
It's just gone to my head

Can you feel it?
I didn't mean it
Can I see you?
What are we doin?
I think I love you
But I ain't sayin
Nothin you don't know

Hold on dreamaway

Somebody to keep me warm til
Til you decide you can come home
You can be a little sumn sumn 
A little sumn sumn on the side


A bad habit, a heart shut
The final act has just begun 
An empty pocket a little love
We all watch the curtain open

How I want this moment to pass
I don't want to fake it no more
Your voice wearing out
Your eyes need some rest

I love you girl God knows I love you
But you know that I know best
Your face different now
So much different than the rest

I love you girl God knows I love you 
But you know that I know best
Daddy's got a brand new bag 
And he's gonna give it all to you

But you don't want none 
Unless I got some 
Just got to get it through to you

When your all alone in the world 
It's so hard enough on you
Because I'm all alone 
And lost without you


Just cause you've shown up everyday 
Doesn't mean that I think you'll stay 
I know you'll leave 
Hell, you're leaving me 
Now, as we speak 
And I can't count on anything 
To take your place when you take your leave 
You happen once 
And heaven knows I'll say, 
You may as well not 
You know I love you but you're mean 
You know I love you but you're mean to me 
Just when I think you're bein sweet 
I remember that you're also brief 
I fall in love 
But I know it won't 
It won't last long 
Here and right now 
Time feels too short, right now 
But it's all we got


I gotta go now, gotta go now
I gotta go now, gotta go now

Hey, little girl
I've gotta go now
Hey, little girl
I've gotta go now

Well, your mum
She's so angry
Hey, little girl
Guess I'd better go now

Hey, little girl
What'cha gonna do bout it now?
Hey, little girl
What'cha gonna do bout it now?

Well, I love you
But I guess I'd better go now
Hey, little girl
Guess I'd better go now

I gotta go now, gotta go now
I gotta go now, gotta go now

I don't want to leave you
But I guess I'd better go now
Soon we'll be together all the time
But until then I gotta go, gotta go

I gotta go now, gotta go now
I gotta go now, gotta go now

Hey, little girl
I gotta go now, gotta go now
Hey, little girl
I gotta go now, gotta go now

Well, I love you
But I guess I'd better go now
Hey, little girl
Guess I'd better go now

I gotta go now, gotta go now
I gotta go now, gotta go now
I've gotta go


I was asking for a drink last night
Never noticing that things just weren't quite right
For the bartender said you look queer
So disappear
Before I realized what I'd be through
A girl came up to me and said I love you
But I whispered gently in her ear
To disappear
What is wrong with everyone in this town
That's what I am asking me
And to my reply it's bound to be
Something I'll never forget
That alone it would happen again
But if it did, I'd know right there and then
I would pack everything I have here
And disappear


The change will do you good
I always knew it would
Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust

Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so sour

Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so sour
Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust

The sins of the flesh
Are simply sins of lust
Sweats running down your back
Sweats running down your neck

Heated couplings in the sun
Or is that untrue?
Colder couplings in the night
Never saw your body

Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so sour
Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know its only lust

The change will do you good
I always knew it would
You know the change will do you good
You know the change will do you good

Damaged goods, send them back
I can't work, I can't achieve, send me back
Open the till, give me the change
You said, would do me good
Refund the cost
You said you're cheap but you're too much

Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so sour
Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust

The change will do you good
I always knew it would
You know the change will do you good
You know the change will do you good

I'm kissing you goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I'm kissing you goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

I'm kissing you goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I'm kissing you goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

I'm kissing you goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I'm kissing you goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye


Now I'm without you and I just can't hide it
And you'll never know anything that I feel inside
You know I still love you, but I stay divided
Cause I always hated your suicide

I guess you'll never bother
Looking back
Call me up to say your last goodbye

Did you think that I could just let you go?
I wish I could've said the words still
To save you

Now I'm without you and I just can't hide it
And you'll never know anything that I feel inside
You know I still love you, but I stay divided
Cause I always hated your suicide

How could you leave us behind?
I was only a boy
And you made mother cry
So I bury my grief far below, deep inside
What else could I do?
You're gone and it's true
We saved your life, cuts like a knife

It's always hard to leave the past behind
I hope someday I'll get the chance to, to tell you

Now I'm without you and I just can't hide it
And you'll never know anything that I feel inside
You know I still love you, but I stay divided
Cause I always hated your suicide
I always hated your suicide


So I thought that you knew the question you were asking me to answer 
Now I find in your indifference you never bothered with what the words meant 
You're pulling, you're headless of the slack that forms behind you 
You're forging, you make another link in the chain of circumstance 

Your mouth made sounds and words, your lips formed them well 
But to discern the content was hard for me to tell 
And falling, you fail sometimes to convince me of sincerity 
And with that pulling in me I build another link for you to add 

Oh my friend, you know I love you, but you make me crazy 
Oh my friend, you know I hate it, but you know it can't stay 
Oh my friend, you know I love you, but you make me crazy 

Now only time together pushes toward my place to answer 
This music's purgatory awaits its end, time's special dancer 
You're doing just as well as a jewel in the mud 
You'll do just a well when your surviving dust ascends into heaven 


Ooh please don't ask me how I feel, I feel fine
Oh I cry a bit, I don't sleep too good, but I'm fine
When can I see you? 
When can I touch you? 

Again and again I ask myself was I wrong? 
Oh but time's a healer, and heaven knows I've been strong
Maybe we could try
Maybe we would work this time

Oh I can remember when it was easy to say I love you
But things have changed since then, now I really can't say if I still do
But I can try
Cos I know the kids are well, yes you're a mother to the world
Oh but I miss my boy
I hope he's good as gold

But enough of me, tell me how are you? you look good
Oh you've lost some weight I can see, your hair looks nice, you look
Good
Maybe we should try, don't say it! I know why

But ya know, I can remember when it was easy to say I love you
But things have changed since then, now I really can't say if I still do
But I can try
Cos I know the kids are well, yes you're a mother to the world
But I miss my boy
Oh I hope he's good as gold


Where does our love lie
In the middle of nowhere
Will it soon pass me by
In the middle of nowhere

Baby, won't you tell me
What am I to do
I'm in the middle of nowhere
Getting nowhere with you

Mmm, where did my heart land
In the middle of nowhere
Where are the dreams I planned
In the middle of nowhere

Listen to me baby
Listen to my plea
I'm in the middle of nowhere
And it's worrying me

Over and over again
You tell me you need my love
If what you say is true
Why can't we be together

Over and over you tell me
I'm all that you're thinking of
Baby you know that I love you
But I can't wait forever

Where does our love lie
In the middle of nowhere
How can you let it die
In the middle of nowhere

Are you gonna to leave me
Leave my heart astray
I'm in the middle of nowhere
Come and show me the way

Over and over again
You tell me you need my love
Baby you know that I love you
But I can't wait forever

Where does our love lie
In the middle of nowhere
How can you let it die
In the middle of nowhere

Are you gonna to leave me
And leave my heart astray
I'm in the middle of nowhere
Come and show me the way

Hey, where does out love lie
Come on now
Where does our love lie
Right slap in the middle of nowhere
Right slap in the middle of nowhere
Right slap in the middle of nowhere


When you came along, oh, happy was I
When you went away, I thought I would die
Oh baby, don't leave me this way
Oh baby

You know how much I need your touch
Baby, I love you a little too much
Oh baby, don't leave me this way
Oh baby

I thought you said our love was true
That you love me and I love you
But now you're gone and I am blue
Oh, what am I gonna do

I just can't see why you wanted to go
You knew all along it would hurt me so
Oh baby, don't leave me this way
Oh baby

I thought you said our love was true
That you love me and I love you
But now you're gone and I am blue
Oh, what am I gonna do

I just can't see why you wanted to go
You knew all along it would hurt me so
Oh baby, don't leave me this way
Oh baby

Oh baby, don't leave me this way
Oh baby


I'm a fool to care when you treat me this way
I know I love you but what can I do I'm a fool to care
I'm a fool to cry when you tell me goodbye
You left me so blue when you were untrue I'm a fool to care
I know I should laugh and call it a day but I know I would cry if you go away
I'm a fool to care when you don't care for me
Why should I pretend I'd lose in the end I'm a fool to care

I'm a fool to care.


Baby, I understand da reason why you're leavin
But dat doesn't make it any easier to bear
I know dat I played dis game a fool wen I was cheatin
Now I'm cryin
Now I'm cryin

Said I lost it, my intentions was not clear
Was not clear
But I was messin wit your feelin's, I didn't care
But I love you
But I love you
But I love you, yeah
But I love you

So I'll cry if you won't take me there
If you won't take me there
To your arms of love
To your arms

So I'll cry if you won't take me there
If you won't take me there
To your arms of love, yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
To your arms
To your arms of love

Sunshiny days, brighten my life
Again, again
To your arms
Wen I'm with you, I feel so alive forever
Cause wen I am down, down and out
You lift me up off my route

Cause, baby, I will
Baby, I will
Love you until forever forever we'll be
You and I for all time
We'll be, we'll be


Holy cow, look what you've done
You've got me now so I can't speak
I wonder how you turned out the stars
I hear your laugh

Like falling railway cars,
Far and away, peaking through the bars
Safe behind your own lock and key
Safe for now from me

God only knows how I love you
But God and His ghost
And His roadhouse crew
Ran me out of town on a silver rail
Free at last and begging Him for jail


Love, let me sleep tonight on your couch
And remember the smell of the fabric
Of your simple city dress

Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real

We walked around til the moon got full like a plate.
And the wind blew an invocation and I fell asleep at the gate
And I never stepped on the cracks cause I thought I'd hurt my mother
And I couldn't awake from the nightmare, that sucked me in and pulled me under
Pulled me under

Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real

I love you
But I'm afraid to love you

I love you
But I'm afraid to love you
I'm afraid

Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real

Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real
Real, real, real

Oh, that was so real
Oh, that was so real

Oh, that was so real


One time I was down and out
And out and in
Well I had myself a little problem
But that's not where I want to begin
Cause lately there's been a funny feeling
That's peering out from inside
I thought that I loved you baby but
I know I got to survive

And I know, know in my heart
It's better that we're apart
I love you but you ain't no friend
This is where I want to be grinnin

Grinnin all the time
You're on your way, I'm on mine

Now this sordid little tale
Has come to an end
All those evenings I was gone and you were
Hanging out with your so-called friends
But a rumor is a rumor, I want the truth
I wasn't born yesterday, I know what you're up to

And I know down in my heart
It's better that we're apart
I love you but you ain't no friend
This is where I want to be grinnin

Grinnin all the time
You're on your way, I'm on mine


Feed the light 
I want to fight about it now 
You won't be lost 
You won't be found 
You won't be lost 
You won't be called out by me 
For sure 
I love you 
But you still believe 
That blossoms under- 
Stand when hit 
With cold hard wind 
It's not the end 
Just changing climate 
For sure 
Be sure 
To feed the light 
Just feel your right to get it wrong 
It's not the end 
It never ends 
You won't be lost 
You won't be found 
Unless you want 
To be 
Found


You needed me 
I wasn't there 
I didn't care 
The way you cared about me 

I broke your heart 
So many times 
Til there was nothing you felt inside 
I didn't know 

That I'd be needing you 
Til I lost your love 
Now you're all I'm thinking of 
Standing here in the pouring rain 

Every night callin out your name 
Lookin for the door to your heart 
Baby please let me see a sign 

Let me know that your love's still mine 
Let me back through the door to your heart 

So many nights 
So all alone 
So many days 
How I wished you still loved me 

I had my chances 
Threw it away 
And now I love you but my love's too late 
I didn't know 

You were the one for me 
Now that I see 
Back in your arms is where I want to be 
Standin here in the pourin rain 

You needed me

Every night callin out your name 
I wasn't there

Looking for the door to your heart 
I didn't care


Baby please let me see a sign 
I broke your heart

Let me know that your love's still mine 
So many times


Let me back through the door to your heart 
I lost your love

Now I love you but my love's too late


All day long before my eyes come little visions of you,
They shouldn't, they mustn't, but they do.
Can't get out of this mood,
Can't get over this feeling,
Can't get out of this mood,

Last night your lips were appealing,
The thrill should have been all gone by today, in the usual way,
But it's only your arms that I'm out of.
Can't get out of this dream
What a fool to dream of you,
Twasn't part of my scheme to sigh and tell you that I love you,
But now I'm saying it, I'm playing it dumb,
Can't get out of this mood,
Heartbreak here I come.

I can't get over this feeling,
Last night your lips were appealing,
The thrill should have been all gone by today, in the usual way,
But it's only your arms that I'm out of.
What a fool to dream of you,
To sigh and tell you that I love you,
But now I'm playing it, now I'm playing it dumb,
I can't get out of this mood,
Heartbreak, heartbreak here I come.


You put a rose in my hand
Put a dollar in my pocket
But you don't understand
How the days grow longer, the sky is black as night
I see the morning but you won't see the light

I thought about you for a long, long time
I wrote about you but my words don't seem to rhyme
And now you're lying here
But my heart still beats for you

Had a dream about you
You sat right down beside me
And you told me we were through
It was all so real and you told me reasons why
You brought me to the window
And you taught me how to fly

I thought about you for a long, long time
I said I love you but we just don't have the time
And now you're lying here
But my heart still beats for you

I thought to hold you for a long, long time
You said I love you but my heart won't seem to chime in
And now you're lying here
And my heart still beats for you.
I'm trying, and my heart still beats for you


If you think you're alone
that you're the only one who is afraid
Let me tell you, I feel just like you do
And sometimes I stand back
From desires and dreams I don't understand
They overwhelm me
I feel just like you do


I feel just like you do
I feel just like you do
Just like you do
Just like you do
I feel just like you do
Just like you do
I feel just like you do

And when it comes to love
You want me to be the one to say
The words: I love you
But I feel just like you do
But let's try to return
To that brave innocence we once knew
I wish you were an ocean
So I could jump into you


He waits for her to understand 
But she won't understand at all 
She waits all night for him to call 
But he won't call anymore 
He waits to hear her say 

Forgive 
But she just drops her pearl-black eyes 
And prays to hear him say 
I love you 
But he tells no more lies 
He waits for her to sympathize 
But she won't sympathize at all 
She waits all night to feel his kiss 
But always wakes alone 
He waits to hear her say 
Forget 
But she just hangs her head in pain 
And prays to hear him say 
No more 
I'll never leave again 

How did we get this far apart? 
We used to be so close together 
How did we get this far apart? 
I thought this love would last forever 

He waits for her to understand 
But she won't understand at all 
She waits all night for him to call 
But we won't call 
He waits to hear her say 
Forgive 
But she just drops her pearl-black eyes 
And prays to hear him say 
I love you 
But he tells no more lies 

How did we get this far apart? 
We used to be so close together 
How did we get this far apart? 
I thought this love would last forever


Keeping through some of hardest times
But he made it through without me
Made it through
I've been to hell and back for you
I did everything that I could
For you,
Oh I, took you in after you lied to me
And yet you cried your tears, tears
And there was I was sorry
For all I have done to you
Now here we are
We can't be friends and lovers
Cause it would all end
In a hurting each other
You know we can't be friends and lovers
But baby I, I love you
But I can't do this, I can't


All day long before my eyes come little visions of you.
They shouldn't, they mustn't, but they do, they do.
And I can't get out of this mood, can't get over this feeling
Can't get out of this mood, last night your lips were too appealing
The thrill should have been all gone by today in the usual way
But it's only your arms I'm out of.
Can't get out of this dream, what a fool I was to dream of you
Wasn't part of my scheme to sigh and tell you that I love you
But I'm sayin it, I'm playin it dumb
Can't get out of this mood, heartbreak, here I come
The thrill should have been all gone by today in the usual way
But it's only your arms I'm out of.
Can't get out of this dream, what a fool I was to dream of you
Wasn't part of my scheme to sigh and tell you that I love you
But I'm sayin it, yes, I'm playin it dumb
Can't get out of this mood, heartbreak, here I come
This mood, can't get out of this mood, can't get out of this mood


Melt Antarctica, savin Africa
I failed algebra and I misused some times
We're at war again, save the world again
You can all join in, but you can't smoke inside

You said Take me home, I can't stand this place
Cause there's too many hipsters and I just can't relate
You're my neon gypsy, my desert rain
You're my Helter Skelter, oh how can I explain that

You're the best I ever had
And I'm trying not to get stuck in my head
But I read that soda kills you and Jesus saves
On the bathroom wall where I saw your name
You're the best I ever had
I won't be the same

Night sky full of drones, this neighborhood of clones
I'm looking at the crowd and they're staring at their phones
They groom the coast line here, the sun will disappear 
Oh God!
And maybe once a year, I think they'll clean my car

Caught my reflection, drop the call
I've been medicated with cigarettes and alcohol
I got vertigo, no I can't see straight
I got obligations though I'm usually late but

You're the best I ever had
And I'm trying not to get stuck in my head
But I think I dropped my wallet in Santa Fe
Lost the only picture I had of you that day and
You're the best I ever had
I won't be the same

Hey West Virginia, Hey North Dakota
I think I love you, but don't even know you
Hey Massachusetts, Hey Minnesota
I think I love you, but don't even know you
Hey Carolina, Hey Oklahoma
I think I love you, but don't even know you
Hey Alabama, Hey California
I think I love you, but don't even know you

You're the best I ever had 
you're the best I ever had
And I'm trying not to get stuck in my head 
get stuck in my head
But I passed the longest sign on the interstate
Saying Find someone before it gets too late
You're the best I ever had 
you're the best I ever had
I won't be the same

Hey West Virginia, Hey North Dakota 
Oh why, oh why
I think I love you, but don't even know you 
I won't be the same
Hey Massachusetts, Hey Minnesota 
you're the best I ever had
I think I love you, but don't even know you 
I won't be the same

Yeah, I won't be the same


She told me Sunday
Baby its over
We can't go on this way
I really love you
But I must live too
She said take care okay?

Please don't look my way
When you see me on the street
We will still be strangers
When we meet

I never really
Thought that you'd give up
Your home and Family
I've got my own life
You've still got your wife
She whispered tenderly

Please don't look my way
When you see me on the street
We will still be strangers when we meet

All throughout this troubled time
Times I wish that you were mine
Spend my nights and days thinking of you
Sometimes lie awake at night
Think of you and its all right
Spend my days and nights
Dreaming of you

She told me Sunday,
Baby its over
We can't go on this way
I really love you
But I must live too
She said take care okay?


Everybody say's that I'm a fool
For the way that I love you
But it just happened I don't have a choice
I can't help it I just do


For no special reason 
I am leaving you for awhile tonight 
I'm flying far above you 
Still I love you 
You make things right 

I've been with you before 
I'll be with you again 
I'll come back for more, yea 
The story has a strange ending 

Well, you know me I'm a nomad 
I can't feel bad 
About the way I am 
I've been rolling around 
My whole life 
You're my candlebright in the window 

You guide me back again 
And I come when you shine 
You are not my friend, no 
But I am something of a dreamer 
I am something of a dreamer 
I am something of a dreamer 

Well, you know me I'm a nomad 
I can't feel bad 
About the way I am 
I've been rolling around 
My whole life 
You're my candlebright in the window 

You guide me back again 
And I come when you shine 
You are not my friend, no 
But I am something of a dreamer 
I am something of a dreamer 
I am something of a dreamer 

Still I love you 
My candlebright 
You are not my friend 
But still I love you 
You're my candlebright 
Still I love you 
But you are not my friend 
But still I love you 
I can't feel bad
You can't stop the rain from falling down
Or make the sunshine not kiss the ground  
And I can't tell this broken heart to stop loving you 
No I can't help it I just do

I miss you sleeping softly next to me
Yes I had it all when I had you  
Tell me how can anyone love someone so much    
I can't help it I just do


She looked at me with eyes that cut right through me and said
You must be blind
Let me tell you a little something about yourself
You're the hurtin kind
I must admit after the pain and fight
I've a sneaking suspicion that you might be right

I love you, I love you, I love you
But I can't stop hurting you
I want to, I want to
I can't stop hurting you
I can't, I can't
I can't stop hurting you, it's getting bad
I don't know what to do

I see you packing up all your precious little things
That mean so much to you
I hurt you now you're moving out again
But we know just what you'll do
We'll see the error of our ways in crime
With conciliatory promises we'll change this time

I love you, I love you, I love you
But I can't stop hurting you
I want to, I want to
I can't stop hurting you
I can't, I can't
I can't stop hurting you, it's getting bad
I don't know what to do

I love you, I love you
I can't stop hurting you
I need to, I need to
I can't stop hurting you
I can't, I can't
I can't stop hurting you
It's getting bad, I don't know what to do

And when you go I miss you all night
The wounds heal from the scratch and bite
I don't know what's wrong
I don't know what's right
But I can't stop hurting you
I can't stop hurting you

We talk so coolly about the pros and cons
When I get hot headed I just can't hold on

I love you, I love you, I love you
I can't stop hurting you
I need to, I need to
I can't stop hurting you
I can't, I can't
I can't stop hurting you
It's getting bad, I don't know what to do


Staring all alone
And your grace and style
Cut me to the bone
With your razor blade smile
I watched you playing pool
It's all around the school that I love you

I love your gypsy hair
And dark brown eyes
Always unprepared
For your pointed replies
Cynical and lean
I lie awake and dream about you

If you only knew
What I'm going through
Time and again I get ashamed
To say your name
It's hard to grin and bear
When you're standing there
My lips are dry
I catch your eye and look away

Sitting in my room
I've got it bad
Crying for the moon
They think I'm mad
They say it isn't real
But I know what I feel and I love you

But I would give my life
For a single night beside you


When you came along, oh, happy was I
When you went away, I thought I would die
Oh baby, don't leave me this way
Oh baby

You know how much I need your touch
Baby, I love you a little too much
Oh baby, don't leave me this way
Oh baby

I thought you said our love was true
That you love me and I love you
But now you're gone and I am blue
Oh, what am I gonna do

I just can't see why you wanted to go
You knew all along it would hurt me so
Oh baby, don't leave me this way
Oh baby

I thought you said our love was true
That you love me and I love you
But now you're gone and I am blue
Oh, what am I gonna do

I just can't see why you wanted to go
You knew all along it would hurt me so
Oh baby, don't leave me this way
Oh baby

Oh baby, don't leave me this way
Oh baby


Starry eyes I've got to try
I love you but I love the rock
And I think you're gonna cry
And the dawn is coming up

As I look out on the rain
But I pick up my guitar
And do it all again
Fade away help me play

It's the feeling I get
When the music is right
That makes me feel this way
You can win or lose it all

Is what makes you want to walk the line
No guarantees you take your chances every time
Oh I know your love is real
And I feel the same

Oh I know it's in my soul
No one can really free me
Starry eyes I love the rock

We run around my friends and me
Telling all the girls we should be free
Up all night and down all day
But we only want to play

Starry eyes you're wandering how
You love a man who loves the rock
And you can't change it now
And the midnight telephone

To say I can't make it home
It's another night you have to face it all alone
Oh I know your love is real
And I feel the same

I know it's in my soul
No one can really free me
Starry eyes I love the rock

Starry eyes I've got to try
I love you but I love the rock
And I think you're gonna cry
And the dawn is coming up

As I look out on the rain
But I pick up my guitar
And do it all again
Oh I know your love is real

And I feel the same
I know it's in my soul
No one can really free me
Starry eyes I love the rock


Lay down my dear Brother, lay down and take your rest 
I want to lay your head upon your Savior's breast 
I love you, but Jesus loves you best 
I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight 
I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight 

Lay down my dear Brother, lay down and take your rest 
I want to lay your head upon your Savior's breast 
I love you, but Jesus loves you best 
I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight 
I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight 

One of these mornings bright and early and soon, goodnight 
Now they're pickin up the spirit to the shore beyond, goodnight 
Go walking in the valley of the shadow of death, goodnight 
His rod and his staff, gonna comfort me, goodnight 
Join the wise, there's a soul to find, goodnight 
Lord send a fire, not a flood next time, goodnight 
To leave for the ark, that wonderful boat, goodnight 
She really loaded down, getting water to float, goodnight 
Now pray for the beast at the ending of the world, goodnight 
He'll eat all the children that would not be good, goodnight 
I remember right well, I remember right well, goodnight 
I went walking to Jerusalem just like John 
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight 
Lay down my dear brother, lay down and take your rest 
I want to lay your head upon your Saviors breast 
I love you, but Jesus loves you best 
I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight 
I bid you goodnight, goodnight, goodnight


Say goodbye
Why I can barely say goodnight
If I can hardly take my eyes from yours
How far can I go?

Walk away
The thought would never cross my mind
I couldn't turn my back on Spring or Fall
Your smile least of all

When I say always, I mean forever
I trust tomorrow as much as today
I am not afraid to say I love you
But I promise you, I'll never say goodbye

We're dancers on a crowded floor
While other dancers leave from song to song
Our music goes on, on and on

And if I ever leave your arms
I really would have traveled everywhere
For my world is there

When I say always, I mean forever
I trust tomorrow as much as today
I am not afraid to say I love you
And I promise you, I'll never say goodbye

How could I ever say goodbye?


She's a movie star arrangement
Got a touch of Bergman to her face
She wears suits and buys him flowers
Smokes his cigarettes and bakes him cakes
He says uh oh I love you
But I'm not sure I trust you
You seem strange to me
She's got green eyes and she's lovely
Reminds me of the it girl with her lips
Got an automatic license
Reads all Dostoyevsky's household tips
He says uh oh I love you
But I'm not sure I trust you
You seem strange to me
How come everyone suspects her
Attach her to a lie detector
Watch a thousand housewives fizz and burn
And every time she answers yes
The needles on his polygraph test
Just go round in circles like his brain
She's got long hair but she's ugly
Got a touch of Einstein to her brain
She wears fat clothes but she's cunning
People say she's easy all the same
He says uh oh I love you
But I'm not sure I trust you
You seem strange to me
It took a thousand cliches just to scold her
Took a man from Stepford and a tape recorder
Got his ego broken, so crestfallen
You made a start, you made us laugh
Stop it. You're a grown man baby
It's just that your head's no good


I just hope that you're okay
You know
You know
I just hope that you're okay

You know I love you
But I really don't see this happening anymore
You know I love you
But I really don't think that it's worth fighting for

And although I love you
There's something I need to say
I done thought a lot about it
And I think I'm gonna leave today

But I hope that you're okay
You know
I just hope that you're okay
You know
And I hope that we are good
You know, that the feeling's mutual
We can work it out
And go our separate ways
I just hope that you're okay
You know
I hope that you're okay
You know

You know I love you
But I can't go through the motions anymore
You know I love you
But I know you don't feel the way you did before
And although I love you
There's something I need to say
But baby it's time to just call it a day

But I hope that you're okay
You know
I just hope that you're okay
You know
And I hope that we are good
You know, that the feeling's mutual
We can work it out
And go our separate ways
I just hope that you're okay
You know
I just hope that you're okay
You know
I hope that you're okay
You know
I just hope that you're okay
We can work it out
And go our separate ways

I know that I hurt you
And I didn't wanna hurt you
But now that I hurt you
Girl I know I don't deserve you
If I'm really being honest here
Girl I know you will be out of here
Cause you don't really love me no more

But I hope that you're okay
You know
I just hope that you're okay
You know
And I hope that we are good
You know, that the feeling's mutual
We can work it out
And go our separate ways
I just hope that you're okay
You know
I just hope that you're okay
You know
And I hope that we are good
You know, that the feeling's mutual
We can work it out
And go our separate ways
I just hope that you're okay
You know
I just hope that you're okay
You know
I hope that you're okay
You know
We can work it out
And go our separate ways

You know
I just hope that you're okay
You know
You know
I just hope that you're okay
You know


Went from a dream to the young supreme

Hey, yeah
Ooh

Searching for a destiny that's mine
There's another place, another time
Touching many hearts along the way, yeah
Hoping that I'll never have to say
Boy, I love you but I gotta let you go 
illusion

Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

Days in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

Follow your emotions everywhere
Is there really magic in the air?
Never let your feeling let you down
Open up your eyes and look around
Boy, I love you but I gotta let you go 
illusion

Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

Days in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

Can it be a picture in my mind?
Never sure exactly what I'll find
Only in my dreams I'll turn you on
Here for just a moment then you're gone
Boy, I love you but I gotta let you go 
illusion

Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in

Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again 
yeah, yo, yo, yo

Hey, yo I don't write love songs leave it up to Luther Vandross
How I choose to live, you don't wanna know the cost
I paid to be the boss, hear it straight from the source
Fortune 500 is how I like to gloss
High side, Korneesh Style, joy ride
Blowin candles in the wind like Princess Di
Get at me, mom, tell me how you really like it
Cause we could fly high, I'll be your co-pilot

Hey, yo back to the girl with all the razzamatazz
Hey, yo, I love you shorty
You talkin all that jazz

Boy, I love you but I gotta let you go
I know you want me but you play me like the lotto
Use and abusin so there won't be no friction
I gotta leave, I can't be in this illusion

Oh, oh 
It's just an illusion

Everyday in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

Days in my mind is confusion
Thoughts of you bring illusions
Trapped in the moment, only you get in
My mind's playing tricks on me again

Trapped in a world, only you get in

Went from a dream to the young supreme
Went from a dream to the young supreme


I used to be a sweetheart 
I used to be alright 
I'd tell myself I love you 
But I'm creeping every night 
When I met you at the party 
And I told you you were pretty 
I was honestly just trying to score 
Whoa, whoa

But you made me wait a week 
Just to kiss you on the cheek 
Now it's breaking my heart to break yours 

I said I loved you in the summer 
But will I love you in the fall 
I thought I wasn't like the others 
Guess I'm an asshole after all 

Come September I'll be gone 
gone, gone

Come September I'll be gone 
gone, gone


I used to be a good guy 
I used to be alright 
I'd tell myself I love you 
But I'm creeping every night 
creep, creep, creep

When I met you at the party 
When I told you you were pretty 
I was honestly just trying to score 

I said I loved you in the summer 
But will I love you in the fall 
I thought I wasn't like the others 
Guess I'm an asshole after all 

Come September I'll be gone 
gone, gone

Come September I'll be gone 
gone, gone


I'd be lying if I said it didn't feel right 
I've been trying 
But I can't just get the feeling back 
When did I become? 
The bad guy 

I said I loved you in the summer 
I loved you in the summer 
But will I love you in the fall 
Lo-love you in the fall 

I thought I wasn't like the others 
I wasn't like the others 
Guess I'm an asshole after all 

Come September I'll be gone 
gone, gone

Come September I'll be gone 
gone, gone

Whoa, whoa
gone, gone, gone
You can miss me when I'm gone
Whoa, whoa


Green Acres is the place to be
Farm livin is the life for me
Land spreadin out so far and wide
Keep Shinjuku just give me that countryside

Tokyo is where I'd rather stay
I get allergic smelling hay
I just adore a penthouse view
Darling I love you but give me Center Street

The chores, the stores
Fresh air, big egg
You are my wife
Good bye city life
Green Acres we are there


At your feet would fall many kings
At your feet will fall many things
At your hands I'd kiss every one of your rings
And this song in silence sings. my love

At your feet I'd kiss every one of your cool toes
My dumb heart is not as smart as what a fool knows
At your kiss I'd curse everyone
For my bad luck I wish but to whisper
I love you but I will not not fuck up your life

At your feet will fall many tears
And your hands will form many fears
Before your face will pace many a peer
I'm the one who comes but to disappear
And reappear oh my dear
I want you near. here

At your feet would fall many queens
At your feet the willow tree leans
And my love will follow you there
Lightning strikes but I don't know where

Is my love
I love you
All my life


I'm the three day man
It's three days too long
Everything is in its right place but
Something is wrong
Time is on wheels
And my legs shake
I have to live with every decision
That you make

And that doesn't mean
That I'll be your slave
It doesn't mean you're here to stay
It doesn't mean we're friends for life
You know I want you
You know that I love you
But I'll never need you anyway
I'll never need you anyway

Sixes and sevens
Oh how it rains
Sleep is a station
Life is a train
People snatch instinctively for
Whatever crutch they need
But I promise not to abuse you
If you don't love me leave

And that means
That I'll be never your slave
It means that you're not here to stay
Means that we're not friends for life
You know how I want you
You know that I love you
But I'll never need you anyway
I'll never need you anyway
Never need you anyway

And that means
That I'll be never your slave
It means you're not here to stay
Means we're not friends for life
You know how I want you
You know that I love you

But I'll never need you anyway
I'll never need you anyway
I'll never need you anyway
Never need you anyway
I'll never need you anyway
I'll never need you!


Five foot nine
She's got legs for days
For days
Green eyes that cut like a knife
And her own little sexy sway
No, she don't waste no time
Moving to the floor
To the floor
And when she starts to move she had me
Calling your mama saying you want to go home

Baby, tell me
Why can't I have you
Why you running girl
I just wanted to love you

I love you
Baby, I love you
I love you
Baby, I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me
I want you
Baby, I want you
I want you
Baby, I want you
But I guess love don't love me, no?

It's ok to be scared
Cause this girl is super bad
She will probably be
The best thing that you never had
Don't waste no time
Don't waste your time
Trying to make her your own 
yeah, yeah
Cuz what she says goes
And like Boyz II Men said this is the end of the road

Baby, tell me
Why can't I have you
Why you running girl
I just wanted to love you

I love you
Baby, I love you
I love you
Baby, I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me
I want you
Baby, I want you
I want you
Baby, I want you
But I guess love don't love me, no

Baby you said you loved me
But you led me on 
Left me feeling strong 
Feeling so strong,about
About you
But I can't take no more, so I'm gonna leave you alone
Girl I'm gone girl I'm gone. Oh!

What's it gonna take to get you to love me baby?
Cuz I can't take it anymore
Take it no more!
And ya gonna be mine for sure, ya know 

I love you
Baby, I love you
I love you
Baby, I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me
I want you
Baby, I want you
I want you
Baby, I want you
But I guess love don't love me, no?


I love you
Baby, I love you
I love you
Baby, I love why
But I guess you don't have time for me
I want you
Baby, I want you
You know what?! Screw You!
But I guess love don't love me


The sound of your footsteps
Telling me that you're near
Your soft gentle motion, baby
Brings out the need in me that no-one can hear, except

In my midnight confessions
When I tell all the world that I love you
In my midnight confessions
When I say all the things that I want to
I love you






But a little gold ring you wear on your hand makes me understand
There's another before me, you'll never be mine
I'm wasting my time

Staggering through the daytime
Your image on my mind
Passing so close beside you baby
Sometimes the feelings are so hard to hide, except

In my midnight confessions
When I tell all the world that I love you
In my midnight confessions
When I say all the things that I want to
I love you

But a little gold ring you wear on your hand makes me understand
There's another before me, you'll never be mine
I'm wasting my time

In my midnight confessions
When I tell all the world that I love you
Na na-na na na na na-na
Na na-na na na na na-na 


Gee whiz, look at his eyes
Gee whiz, how they hypnotize 
He's got everything a girl could want 
Man, oh, man, what a prize
What a prize
ooh-ooh 

Gee whiz 
gee whiz
he's all the joy 
Gee whiz 
gee whiz
I could find in a boy 
He's awful nice, it's paradise 
I hope that I'm his decoy 
his decoy

Heaven up above knows how much 
I love that fellow so
Angels sing of the love that he brings 
I hope our love will grow and grow 

Oh, gee whiz 
gee whiz
I love that guy 
Gee whiz 
gee whiz
my, my, oh my 
There are things we could do 
I could say I love you

There are things we could do 
I could say I love you 
But all I can say is
Gee whiz


I was staring at the ceiling
You're so pretty when you're mad
All that I can hear is breathing
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah, aah-aah-aah-aah-aah
And we're stuck inside the silence
In a cold cold war
We're too proud to say we're sorry
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah, aah-aah-aah-aah-aah

Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words will tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a papercut
Right now I don't know why I love you
But by the morning when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a papercut

I find refuge in a distance
Even when we're breaking down 
down, down, down, down
Can we pause it just for one kiss?
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah, aah-aah-aah-aah-aah
Cause I never meant to hurt you
And I know you feel the same
Still the only one I run to
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah, aah-aah-aah-aah-aah

Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words will tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a papercut
Right now I don't know why I love you
But by the morning when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a papercut

Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words will tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a papercut
Right now I don't know why I love you
But by the morning when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a papercut

Just a paper, just a papercut
Just a paper, just a papercut
Just a paper, just a papercut
Just a paper, just a papercut


Lie a little before you break my heart
I know what's going through your mind you planned to leave our love behind
You're wondering how to break the news to me
I hate to see you worry so I love you but I'll let you go

First you have to help me set you free
If you could
lie a little and tell me you still care try a little to ease the pain I bear
Say you love me once more before we part lie a little before you break my heart

And now that I am losing you what harm can maybe even do
Before a little longer I pretend
If you had ever cared at all give me the chance to break the fall
Lie a little say it's not the end
If you could
lie a little.


Yes, you loved me and you sold my clothes
I love you, but that's the way that it goes
So it goes
Yes, you know how I feel
So it goes
It just couldn't be real
And we know it's wrong
And I don't think it's gonna go on
When I come home carrying my shoes
I've been waiting to tell you some news
And you want me home all night
And you don't want another fight

But you better love
Find some love
You better love me, Jesus Christ

Yes, you loved me and you sold all my clothes
I love you, baby, but that's the way that it goes
So it goes
I guess you know how I feel
So it goes
Yes, it couldn't be real

And you want me home all night
You just don't want another fight
But you better love
Find some love
Love me baby, Jesus Christ


I want to say I love you 
But I don't know how 
I want to say I need you 
But I don't know how 
If I said would you love me 
Could you
I want to feel you breathing 
Your body next to mine 
Let me hear your heart beat 
Let me hold your hand 
If I said let's go dancing 
Would you
Feel in my mind 
You want me 
But some friends told you 
I'm no good 
No good 
She's no good no good 
See by your eyes 
I've touched you 
I've touched you deep down inside 
Inside 
No need for words inside
Come with me let's go romancing 
Let's go out dancing 
Let's go romancing 
All night long


We all have a dream
of a place we belong
The fire is burning
and the radio's on
Somebody smiles
and it means I love you
but sometimes we don't notice
when the dream has come true

You've got a home here
Call it what you want
You've got a home here
to return to when you can't
face the world and you need
some support to succeed
You've got a home

We all make a mess
of our lives from time to time
It's part of the process
that you stumble as you climb
And if you ever feel
the pain is far too big a deal
I say with pride
I'll be on your side

You've got a home here
Call it what you want
You've got a home here
You're gonna want it when you can't
face the world and you need
some support to succeed
You've got a home


Ah, the morning after the sound of laughter
Is hollow and thin
The sound of tears falls on my ears
Just how it all went wrong is not very clear
My pillow is cold, I feel the fear

I don't wanna love you
But I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
Something in my heart tells me be still
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba

I don't want to love you
But I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I don't want to love you
But I will, I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will

It's out of my hands now, beyond my mind
I don't understand now, my eyes are blind
It's sad to discover what's under the cover
Of their eyes you know

A smile that's blinding is most 
The path to tomorrow will lead me nowhere
You dim the lights, I see the tears

I don't wanna love you
But I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
Something in my heart tells me be still
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba

I don't want to love you
But I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I don't want to love you
But I will, I will, I will, I will
I will, I will, I will, I will, I will, I will

I don't want to love you
But I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
Something in my heart tells me be still
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
I don't want to love you


I turned around and you were standing there
More than a little high
More than a little crazy
So beautiful I had to stare
And I knew you had the power to change me
Scarlet woman, you've come for me
Your timing's great, cause I've been
Waiting so long
The only thing I want to say
Now that you've got me, please-
Don't change my life
You know I love you but I hate your friends
They got dollars but they ain't got sense
If the time comes and you go away
I hope I've changed and yet stayed the same
Scarlet woman you've come to me
Your timing's great cause I've been
Waiting so long
Only thing I want to say
Now that you've got me, please-
Don't change my life


I moved your picture
From my walls
And I replaced them
Both large and small
And each new day
Finds me so blue
Nothing
Takes the place of you

I read your letters one by one
And I still love you
When it's all said and done
And oh, my darling, I'm so blue
Because nothing
Oh nothing
Takes the place of you

I, I write this letter
It's raining on my window pane
I, I feel the need of you
Because without you
Nothing seems the same

So I'll wait
Until you're home
Again I love you
But I'm all alone
And oh my darling
I'm so blue
Because nothing
Oh, but nothing takes the place of you


I wish that I was in your shoes
Maybe I'd understand the pressure, pressure
My temper's always on the loose
I made a vow to forget her, forget her

You break the fall
It's not easy to trust
I wanna love you
But I'm just too cynical

We live the words
They never hear
I know it hurts you
But I just can't leave it alone

I caught you playing in the fire
Did you feel at home?
Did you feel at home?
My mind is winding down a spiral
I don't know where I go

You break the fall
It's not easy to trust
I wanna love you
But I'm just too cynical

We live the words
They never hear
I know it hurts you
But I just can't leave it alone

You break the fall
It's not easy to trust
I wanna love you
But I'm just too cynical

We found our ways to make it work 
make it work
Two different people in one moment 
moment
You say failure is a curse 
is a curse
Sometimes a blessing isn't all

You break the fall
It's not easy to trust
I wanna love you
But I'm just too cynical

We live the words
They never hear
I know it hurts you
But I just can't leave it alone

You break the fall
It's not easy to trust
I wanna love you
But I'm just too cynical

We live the words
They never hear
I know it hurts you
But I just can't leave it alone

You break the fall
It's not easy to trust
I wanna love you
But I'm just too cynical

We live the words
They never hear
I know it hurts you
But I just can't leave it alone


Last night I came home, but you weren't there, 
Found all my things, thrown everywhere. 
No one to talk to, no one to talk to but the blues 

Oh I read your letter, signed, I love you, 
But in your letter, said we were through. 
No one to talk to, no one to talk to but the blues 

Sometimes, when we quarrel, 
The things that are said 
Can make, you feel bitter, 
When you'd rather feel love instead 

Well come on back home, where you belong, 
I love you baby, yes, I was wrong. 
No one to talk to, no one to talk to but the blues 

Repeat Bridge 

Well come on back home, where you belong, 
I love you baby, Lord, I was wrong. 
No one to talk to, no one to talk to but the blues 
No one to talk to, no one to talk to but the blues


I know I think a lot 
But somehow it just doesn't help 
It only makes it worse 

The more I think 
The more I know 
The more it hurts 

With only solitude to meet me like a friend 
Oh, where are you? 
Where are you? 
Where are you? 

Maybe she sits alone 
Beyond the storm 
Across the raging torrent of the sea 
She knows I want her 
And she knows I'll always be
How can I live without the love I cannot see 
Oh where are you? 
Where are you? 
Where are you? 

Oh 
I know there's someone there 
I hear her breathe 
Behind the silence of the dark 
But I know that I won't see 
Til we open up our eyes together 
She'll look at me 
What a moment that moment will be! 

And she looks so light 
I could fly her through the night 

Oh 
I know I think a lot 
But somehow it just doesn't help 
It only goes to show 
That what you never miss 
You never know 
But I have loved you from the moment that we knew 
Oh, I love you 
I love you 
But where are you?


Johnny was a peculiar guy
Brough up on love and the reasons why
But the reasons why ought not to be said
And so I'm left hands held to my head

I love you
I love you
I love you

It's a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful thing
It's a beautiful, beautiful thing

Chances, changes are all that you have
As you take the hard stuff and lie on your back
The smoothness, strangeness
Fits like a glove
But the comfort of tease
Still rises above

I love you
I love you
I love you

But is it possible, possible, possible babe?
Is it possible for you and me?

Gold and waves and Betty Blue
Are the images that lead to the clues of why
I can't love you
I can't love you
I can't love you
It isn't possible


I try to show you that I love you
But money is the only thing that means anything
I tried to give you my heart girl
But that doesn't mean a god damned thing
American girl
You're a demons new clothes repeat
I try and keep myself from falling
But you you have your evil ways
Feed off of my emptiness and my loneliness
Picking my pockets everyday
American girl
You're A demons new clothes


I was asking for a drink last night
Never noticing that things just weren't quite right
For the bartender said you look queer
So disappear
Before I realized what I'd be through
A girl came up to me and said I love you
But I whispered gently in her ear
To disappear
What is wrong with everyone in this town
That's what I am asking me
And to my reply it's bound to be
Something I'll never forget
That alone it would happen again
But if it did, I'd know right there and then
I would pack everything I have here
And disappear


Whoa-ooh baby, I love you

Ooh baby I love you, yeah 
Whoa-ooh baby, I love you

Ooh baby I love you 
Spoken:

Wait a minute! 
You know my woman told me, she said, 
Bo Diddley, I love you, but I'm leavin
I said, What? 
She said, I love you but I'm leavin you 
And I said, Baby? 
And she kept sayin, Whoa baby, I love you 
What you say, girl? 
Whoa-ooh baby, I love you

Ooh, I love you 
Ooow! Somethin wrong here someplace 
Whoa-oh baby, I love you

Wait a minute! 
She said, Here's the key to all of your locks, 
take my name off of your mailbox 
Here's the key to your Cadillac, 
I got my own parked right out back 
I said, What? 
There somethin wrong here 
And she kept talkin 'bout 
I love you 
Whoa-ooh baby, I love you

Fellas, let me tell you somethin
Ha, ha, ha 
Wow! Woo, somethin wrong 
Whoa-oh baby, I love

Wait a minute! 
Let me tell you what else she told me 
She said, You know one thing, Diddley 
I got all my bags packed, 
in the middle of the dining room floor 
I'm all packed and ready to go 
I said, But baby, whoa baby 
Baby, baby 
And then she told me 
she said, Got my own place, 
with some brand new lock 
I'm gonna tell the mailman, 
I got a brand new box 
I said 
Whoa-oh baby, I love you

Woo you ain't

There's somethin wrong some place 
She kept talkin 'bout 
Ooh baby, 
I want you, I love you

I need you

I love you
I love you 
I love you



I wanna love you but you're not making it easy
I wanna love you but you're not making it easy
I wanna love you but it's not easy
I wanna love you but it's not easy

Sometimes my head bends
I kinda got hooked on your scent

A funny trick, a handshake
I wanna peek, I wanna sip
I show a funny trick, my handshake
Giving me a peek, giving me a sip

Wanna do it, if we do it, it's my way
Cause how you do it when you do it, it's not okay

Sometimes my head bends
I kinda got hooked on your scent

A funny trick, a handshake
I wanna peek, I wanna sip
I show a funny trick, my handshake
Giving me a peek, giving me a sip

Something vague, a little opening
I wanna come inside

A bad habit, a toxic habit
I know I've got to let you go
It goes for all of us
You're not curious
I don't think you should hang with us

Oh, a bad habit, a toxic habit
I know I've got to let you go
It goes for all of us
You're not curious
I don't think you should hang with us


Why did we ever come so far ?
I knew I'd seen it all before
Tall building reach up in vain
Tinseltown is in the rain

I know now love was so exciting
Tinseltown in the rain
Oh men and women
Here we are, caught up in this big rhythm

One day this love will all blow over
Time for leaving the parade
Is there a place in this city
A place to always feel this way

And hey, there's a red car in the fountain
Tinseltown in the rain
Oh men and women
Here we are, caught up in this big rhythm

Do I love you ? Yes I love you
Will we always be happy go lucky ?
Do I love you ? Yes I love you
But it's easy come, and it's easy go

All this talking is only bravado yeah
Oh, Tinseltown
Tinseltown in the rain
Oh men and women

Here we are, caught up in this big rhythm
Tinseltown in the rain
Oh men and women
Here we are, caught up in this big rhythm

Tinseltown is in the rain
Tinseltown is in the rain
Tinseltown is in the rain
Tinseltown is in the rain

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Do I love you ? Yes I love you
Will we always be happy go lucky ?
Do I love you ? Yes I love you
But it's easy come, and it's easy go

All this talking, talking is only bravado
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Tinseltown is in the rain
Tinseltown is in the rain
Tinseltown is in the rain
Tinseltown is in the rain


It's been a long, long time
Since I've memorized your face
It's been four hours now
Since I've wandered through your place
And when I sleep on your couch
I feel very safe
And when you bring the blankets
I cover up my face

I do
Love you
I do
Love you

And when you play guitar
I listen to the strings buzz
The metal vibrates underneath your fingers
And when you crochet
I feel mesmerized and proud

And I would say I love you
But saying it out loud is hard
So I won't say it at all
And I won't stay very long

But you are life I needed all along
I think of you as my brother
Although that sounds dumb

And words are futile devices


Officer
Please don't haul me in
Though I'm drunk again
I can explain
I swear to you
For a week I have
Been completely dry
Until tonight
He's been such a good example
Everything he's done for me
I couldn't bear to let him down

Monday night
Brother sat me down
Very graciously
And explained
If I'm going to help you
I must make it very clear
Brother that I love you
But certainly I hate your sin
So you see you can't arrest me
I swore I'd be careful not to
Further shame the family name


Can't find the reason to stay with you
By now a reason should appear
Anybody else could understand my fear

That you're much, too much
You're much, too much
Much, too much, too soon
You're much, too much, too soon

don't think I'm blown away by what I am
It's just a job that keeps me travelin, man
One thing I've learned is how to take my time

And you're much, too much
You're much, too much
You're much, too much, too soon
You're much, too much, too soon, soon

don't get too heavy baby
You've only known me for a week
Gotta keep it steady babe, steady babe, ooh
Gotta keep it real

Anything that I could say, everything I've been sayin
All comes down to that same old thing
That I love you but I don't love you
I love you but I don't love you

Let it go, let it go, let it go, now baby
I know, I know, I know you baby, I know you baby
Let me go, let me go, let me go, now baby
I know, I know, I know baby, baby

Let it go, let it go, let it go, now baby
I know, I know, I know you baby, I know you baby
Let me go, let me go, let me go, now baby
I know, I know, I know baby, baby

Let it go, let it go, let it go, now baby
I know, I know, I know you baby, I know you baby
Let me go, let me go, let me go, now baby
I know, I know, I know baby, baby

Let it go, let it go, let it go, now baby
I know, I know, I know you baby, I know you baby
Let me go, let me go, let me go, now baby
I know, I know, I know baby, baby

Let it go, let it go, let it go, baby
I know, I know, I know, baby doll, baby


I didn't think that I'd miss you but I do I didn't think I'd feel lonely but I do
I didn't think that everyday would be so long while you're away
I didn't think that I'd love you but I do

Do you long for someone's arms like I do do you wish that you were here like I do
Do you think our love would last if we'd forget about the past
Do I want our love to live yes I do

Do you wish that God would bind us like I do
Do you wish that joy would find us like I do
If you wish that you could spend life with me until the end
Then you'd feel our love like I do
I didn't think that I'd miss you.


I tried to love you I thought I could 
I tried to own you I thought I would 
I want to peel the skin from your face 
Before the real you lays to waste 
You told me I'm the only one 

Sweet little angel you should have run 
Lying, crying, dying to leave 
Innocence creates my hell 

Cheating myself still you know more 
It would be so easy with a whore 
Try to understand me little girl 
My twisted passion to be your world 

Lost inside my sick head 
I live for you but I'm not alive 
Take my hand before I kill 
I still love you, but, I still burn 

Yeah, love, hate, love
Yeah, love, hate, love
Yeah, love, hate, love
Oh, Love, hate, love 
Yeah, Love, hate, love


Lately you say he's been callin
Saying that he wants you back
I hope and pray you're not fallin
For that old line when it's an act


It's just smoke from an old flame
And smoke disappears in the wind
It's just smoke from an old flame
He'll look in your eyes and tell you more lies
And, girl, then he'll burn you again

I love you but I'd never keep you
From leaving if you want to go
It hurts me but, girl, I'll release you
If that's what you want
But I hope you know



He'll never change, his words are the same
You've heard them all before
He says he wants you
You know it's not true
So why go back for more

Baby I'm sitting on fire
There's an old flame still burns in my heart
When we're together a fire burns bright
But the old flame ignites when we part

Baby you know that I love you
But the memory still haunts at my door
When we're together we stand so tall
But the part of me still falls to the floor

Set me free and I do believe

Baby I'm sitting on fire
But the flames put a hole in my heart
When we're together a fire burns bright
But the old flame ignites when we part

It's so hard to fight when you're losing
I got a little tear in my soul
In my own time I've been losing fast
And I can't even hold what I own

Set me free and I do believe


I don't want to, I don't want to
I don't want to let you know how much I want you
Don't come near me, I don't trust you
I don't trust the way you thrill me when I touch you

I was happy free and easy, I could go around 
And do the things that please me
I don't want to get tied down with a girl like you
I don't want to . love you, but I do

I was happy free and easy, I could go around 
And do the things that please me
I don't want to get tied down with a girl like you
I don't want to . love you, but I do
I don't want to love you, but I do


I'm so tired wishing I was miles away from you
I'm so tired imagining the ways that I'd kill you
I can't stand another day in my life
I can't stand another day

So pay another ticket
Take another pill
And bury me
It's hard to say I love you
But it's hard to say goodbye
So bury me
Bury me

I'm so tired of hurting myself but I can't hurt you
I'm leaving a trail of misery protecting you
I can't stand another day in my life
I can't stand another day

So pay another ticket
Take another pill
And bury me
It's hard to say I love you
But it's hard to say goodbye
So bury me
Bury me
Bury me

I can't stand another day in my life
I can't stand another day

So pay another ticket
Take another pill
And bury me
I know I said I love you
So I guess this is goodbye
So bury me
Bury me
I know everything's my fault
So bury me
I know everything's my fault
So bury me
Bury me
Marry me


My name is Kweli and I love to spit it homie
I rap about love and life, ladies get to know me
If you feelin lonely, I can be your one and only
I put it out in the world, so people show me love 
echoes
Yeah, I always get it back
This ain't no pimp game here, that's a different track
We talkin this and that, we need to get with this
I keep it realer than most, this is our business

What we gotta do to make them see
We got a good thing going on
Wanna tell the world if they don't know
That what we have is real
Wanna shout it from the mountains baby
That I love you, but if they don't hear me
I know, you know, we know

Yo, hey baby look like you need a break tonight
Let me make it right, baby won't you stay the night
I got a lot of love as you know you're my favorite right?
Hey my lady, what we gon make tonight 
our love.
That's the dream, but I never sleep
Across the crowded room, our eyes forever meet
But without doubt and gloom, cuz we can never be
That's why I got to go, cuz you're my impossible love
You're the horizon I can see but never ride off into
I write my lyrics to you, you the perfect instrumental
I sound better than the cat who rappin to you now
That's between me and you, what happened to us now?
Got you hopin for the glorious
Waitin for that victorious feelin wanted by all of us
Kneelin and praying that the lord in us will help us love ourselves
So much that the confidence attract to someone else

What we gotta do to make them see
We got a good thing going on
Wanna tell the world if they don't know
That what we have is real
Wanna shout it from the mountains baby
That I love you, but if they don't hear me
I know, you know, we know

Yo, Rockin Los Angeles, House of Blues in Sunset
Performin like an orgasm, my girl ain't even cum yet
Seen her by the side of the stage givin me energy
Potentially, wife material connectin mentally
I felt like heaven sent for me, you're meant for me
The doubters and the haters had to acknowledge eventually
You was a non-believer too if memory serves
And a heart that gives shit, tryin to play your boy for the her
The harder that I run to you, the farther you become
It's like my heart was part of some movie that hadn't yet begun
This woman moves me and I'm a mountain of a man
You pull me in like the waves do the grain of sand 
love, love, love
Yeah, I love the way you bring it to me
I wrote a song for you, I love to hear you to sing it for me
And let the melody carry me through the jealousy
And we can cruise like Tom and Phenelope

What we gotta do to make them see
We got a good thing going on
Wanna tell the world if they don't know
That what we have is real
Wanna shout it from the mountains baby
That I love you, but if they don't hear me
I know, you know, we know

What we gotta do to make them see
We got a good thing going on
Wanna tell the world if they don't know
That what we have is real
Wanna shout it from the mountains baby
That I love you, but if they don't hear me
I know, you know, we know


Play the guitar, play it again, my Johnny
Maybe you're cold but you're so warm inside
I was always a fool for my Johnny
For the one they call Johnny Guitar
Play it again, Johnny Guitar

What if you go, what if you stay, I love you
But if you're cruel, you can be kind, I know
There was never a man like my Johnny
Like the one they call Johnny Guitar

There was never a man like my Johnny
Like the one they call Johnny Guitar
Play it again, Johnny Guitar


Guess you think that you're cool
Guess you think that you're smart
Guess you think you can tie up my heart
With a ribbon and pull it apart

You don't wanna get down
You don't wanna go deep
Well, I told you I love you
But baby, I figured that you were asleep

If you were a man
You'd walk out that door
Tell me love is a crazy game
We've played it before

If you were a man
You'd get up and go
Coz you know what it takes
Takes a woman to know

Did you think that I'd wait
With my arms open wide?
When I saw that it's over
I saw it was written right there in your eyes

You don't wanna get down
You don't wanna go deep
Well, I told you I love you
But baby, I figured that you were asleep

If you were a man
You'd walk out that door
Tell me love is a crazy game
We've played it before

If you were a man
You'd get up and go
Coz you know what it takes
Takes a woman to know

Takes a woman, takes a woman
Takes a woman to know
Takes a woman, takes a woman
Takes a woman to know

Well, I wanted you forever, babe
But that ain't your style
So next time I'm kissing you
I'll be kissing you goodbye, yeah

If you were a man
You'd walk out that door
Tell me love is a crazy game
We've played it before

If you were a man
You'd get up and go
Coz you know what it takes
Takes a woman to know
Takes a woman to know
Takes a woman to know


Larry, call a load of smoke in
I wanna lose a couple days
We've probably never struggled coping but
I never want to
Promise again that I would call her
Forget the time cause I'm seven hours behind
It's probably good I didn't call, though
But I always want to

And I'd beg you
But you know I'm never home
And I love you but I need another year alone
And I've tried to
Ignore it every time you phone
But I never come close

And I don't think through things
I never get time
Cause I don't think things through

Larry call a load of smoke in
I wanna disappear for days
We've probably never struggled sleeping but
I never want to
Promise again that I would call her
Forget the time cause I'm seven hours behind
It's probably good I didn't call though
But I always want to

And I'd beg you
But you know I'm never home
And I love you but I need another year alone
And I've tried to
Ignore it every time you phone
But I never come close

I don't think through things
I never get time
Cause I don't think things through
I don't think through things
I never get time
Cause I don't think things through

And I'd beg you
But you know I'm never home
And I love you but I need another second to myself
And I've tried to
Ignore it every time you phone
But I never come close

I don't think through things, I never get time
I'd beg you but you know I'm never home
I don't think through things, I never get time
and I love you but I need another year alone
I don't think through things, I never get time
and I've tried to ignore it every time you phone
But I never come close


Hmm stupid in love
Oh, stupid in love, hmm

Let me tell you something
Never, have I ever 
Been a size ten in my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see
What you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it, even though Katy
Told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, hmm
Don't understand it blood on your hands
And still you insist on repeatedly trying
To tell me lies
And I just don't know why, oh

This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

My new nickname is You Idiot 
such an idiot
Hmm that's what my friends are calling me when
They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me let go
He is not the one
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it
Scheming and cheating oh girl
Why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right
You telling me this, I don't wanna listen
But you insist on repeatedly trying
To tell me lies
And I just don't know why

This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

Trying to make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep holding on 
oh
But the dunce cap is off
You don't know what you've lost
And you won't realize
Till I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one
Which one of us is really dumb

Oh ooh
No
No
No, I'm not stupid in love

This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

I may be dumb but
I'm not stupid in love


Now that I've lost everything to you
You say you want to start something new
And it's breaking my heart you're leaving
Baby, I'm grieving

But if you want to leave, take good care
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there

Oh baby baby it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh baby baby it's a wild world

I'll always remember you like a child, girl
You know I've seen a lot of what the world can do
And it's breaking my heart in two
Cause I never want to see you sad girl
Don't be a bad girl
But if you want to leave take good care
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware
Beware

Oh baby baby it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl

Baby I love you, but if you want to leave take good care
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad
And beware, beware

Oh baby baby it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl


Sit down honey gotta have us a talk
You man is a little upset
There's a couple of things that's been missing
And I ain't found em yet

I ain't pointing no fingers ain't layin no blame
And I don't want to lose my cool
But you just don't fool with a country boy's tool
Tool box

Now did I hear you right you loaned em out
To the neighbor down the road
Hey I'd just as soon you'd let him have my ole bird dog
Or my favorite fishing pole

Now there's one little lesson that you need to learn
You just don't fool with a country boy's tool
Tool box

It was handed down from my daddy's dad
Back in nineteen forty-two
And they may be rusty and they might be old
But they're kinda like my family jewels

Honey I love you but there's something else too
That I care about a heck of a lot
Oh you just don't fool with a country boy's tool
Tool box

Now I don't want to hurt your tender heart
And I really do understand
That a friend in need is a friend indeed
And you offered a helping hand

But it something gets broke and it's gotta be fixed
Well I don't blame you know who
Cause you just don't fool with a country boy's tool
Tool box

It was handed down from my daddy's dad
Back in nineteen forty-two
And they may be rusty and they might be old
But they're kinda like my family jewels
Honey I love you but there's something else too
That I care about a heck of a lot
Oh you just don't fool with a country boy's tool
Tool box


A child asks his mother do you love me
And it really means will you protect me
His mother answers him I love you
And it really means you've been a good boy
I love you as the years go by
Will not love another guy
At seventeen a girl says do you love me
And it really means will you respect me
The teenage boy answers yes I love you
I love you as the years go by
Will not love another guy
I-I-I love you forever
I-I-I love you forever

She says do you love me
And it means I'd like to hear it again
Her husband says to her I love you
But it really means I love you till the end
I love you as the years go by
Will not love another guy
Now you're asking me if I love you
And it really means will I marry you
And I answer yes I love you
But it really means that I won't be untrue
I love you as the years go by
Will not love another guy
I-I-I love you forever
I-I-I love you forever


I don't think you know that I hear you
That you've been talking in your sleep
You've been saying crazy things yeah
As it all unfolds I get a clear view
Of what you've been doing to me
You've been lying through you're teeth
And it makes me want to scream

It's like I don't know who you are
Feels like a dagger in my heart
Suddenly now it seems
I'm sleeping with the enemy
Can't stop replaying the words you said
You're like a stranger in my bed
Suddenly now it seems
I'm sleeping with the enemy

What is it she does that I don't do
Is she far more beautiful
Does she make you feel at home
Was it not enough, that I love you
But you've been giving her your kiss
And it almost makes me sick
That I have to hear like this

It's like I don't know who you are
Feels like a dagger in my heart
Suddenly now it seems
I'm sleeping with the enemy
Can't stop replaying the words you said
You're like a stranger in my bed
Suddenly now it seems
I'm sleeping with the enemy


Your cruel device
Your blood, like ice
One look, could kill
My pain, your thrill

I wanna love you but I better not touch 
don't touch
I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much 
too much
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison, running through my veins
You're poison
I don't want to break these chains

Your mouth, so hot
Your web, I'm caught
Your skin, so wet
Black lace, on sweat

I hear you calling and it's needles and pins 
and pins
I wanna hurt you just to hear you screaming my name
Don't want to touch you but you're under my skin 
deep in
I wanna kiss you but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison, running through my veins
You're poison
I don't want to break these chains
Poison

One look, could kill
My pain, your thrill

I wanna love you but I better not touch

I wanna to hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna to kiss you but I want it too much 
too much
I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison
You're poison, running through my veins
You're poison

I wanna love you but I better not touch

I wanna hold you, but my senses tell me to stop
I wanna kiss you but I want it too much

I wanna taste you but your lips are venomous poison

I cried so hard that you pushed me further away
I screamed so loud you called the police on me
I got so city girl on you
I get so sad 
That sad gets to be
So scared that all my feelings 
They up and leave me
I got so city girl on you
I go so crazy I
Don't know what to do
Ooh, ooh
I look so long
I get obvious
I look so hard
I look obvious
I work so much
I miss the sun shine away
I sleep so little
Watch the stars fade into day
I get so city girl on you
I go so crazy I
Don't know what to do
Ooh, ooh
I get uncertain 
Promise I'll be perfect from now on
But all my promises
They're out the window once you're gone
You pack your bags
You say I love you but I cannot stay
So I started smoking
Thought the signals
Would scare your wolves away
I got so city girl on you
I went so crazy I
Didn't know what to do
I got so city girl on you
I went so crazy I
Didn't know what to do
Ooh, ooh
I cry so hard that you push me
Further away
I scream so loud you call the
Police on me
You pack your bags
You say I love you but I cannot stay
So I started smoking
Thought the signals
Would scare your wolves away
I got so city girl on you
I went so crazy I
Didn't know what to do
I got so city girl on you
I went so crazy I
Didn't know what to do
Ooh


I've been drinking too much
Not been thinking enough
She's been coming around, but I've been gone
I've been taking my time
Always walking that line
Between what I know is right and what is wrong

Just another day of growing up
I get stuck in my romance and
I can't win, no matter what I say
But you love me anyway

Oh, you know I love you
But no, I am not a saint
Oh, I make stupid mistakes
But you love me anyway
Oh, I forgot your birthday
And yeah, I show up late
Oh, I'll get it right someday
Cause you love me anyway

I've been smoking too much
But I'm giving it up
I feel this air in my lungs, so won't you stay?
Cause I go crazy sometimes
Always think that I am right
You, my love, in my life forever, babe

Just another day of growing up
I get stuck in my romance and
I can't win, no matter what I say
But you love me anyway

Oh, you know I love you
But no, I am not a saint
Oh I make stupid mistakes
But you love me anyway
Oh I forgot your birthday
And yeah I show up late

If you think I want to please you if you're in my arms and squeeze you
Do anything but leave you you're right I need you real bad
If you think my heart is yearning for you to be returning
If you think the flame's still burning well you're right I need you real bad
I've never thought I'd love someone the way that I love you
But I'll admit this is if I'm really wantin you
So baby let's on tarry I'm really in a hurry
For me and you to marry you're right I need you so bad

If you think I want to please you.


Sleep little one
Tomorrow's more fun
We'll dance in the rain
And we'll sing in the sun

I think you're the best
But you're being a pest
You know that I love you
But I need my rest

If you love me
You will go pee
Put on your pajamas
And then go to sleep

Please little friend
Get in your bed
And let the adventures
Be dreams in your head

Sleep little one
Tomorrow's more fun
We'll dance in the rain
And we'll sing in the sun


Girl, I surrender, that's no lie
You don't remember, how I tried
All I can dream, all I say

Don't make it better
Walking around with a brick in my head
Hanging around, still trying to make it better
Thinking by now, that I'm sick in the head
Cause it's everything that you don't want
Give you everything, but you don't care
Girl, I love you, but you say you don't
Hell it's everything that you don't want

Girl, it's a wonder, I survived
You are the hunger, burning my insides
Living your dream, call my name

I'll make it better
Walking around with a brick in my head
Hanging around, still trying to make it better
Thinking by now, that I'm sick in my head
Cause it's everything that you don't want
Give you everything, but you don't care
Girl, I love you, but you say you don't
Hell it's everything that you don't want

Wait a minute, you got a noose around my heart
Come on, come on, come on, squeeze
All that your breaking is my heart
Your gonna freeze it, baby you've gone so cold!

Girl, I surrender
Walking around with a brick in my head
Hanging around, still trying to make it better
Girl, I surrender
Thinking by now, that I'm sick my head
Cause it's everything that you don't want
Girl, I surrender
I give you everything, but you don't care
Girl, I love you, but you say you don't
Girl, I surrender
And it's everything that you don't want
Oh yeah, it's everything that you don't want
Girl, I surrender

I'll be brave this time
Cause it's everything that you don't want
Girl, I surrender
Giving you everything but you don't care
Girl, I love you, but you say you don't
Girl, I surrender
It's everything that you don't want
It's all everything that you don't want
Girl, I surrender

That's a lie girl
That's no lie girl
Girl, I surrender
That's all I'll say
Cause it's everything that you don't want
Girl, I surrender
It's everything that you don't want
I give you everything but you don't care
Walking around with a brick in my head


You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still you live inside of me
So tell me, how is that?

You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I love to not forgive
And though you break my heart
You're the only one

And though there are times when I hate you cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me and put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you, it pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

I don't wanna be without you, baby
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, baby
I don't want to play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no

I don't want a broken heart
And I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
I'm no broken-hearted girl

There's something that I feel I need to say
But up till now I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out

You say you got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel your not deserving of me
And still you're in my heart
But you're the only one

And, yes, there are times when I hate you, but I don't complain
Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you; I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day

I don't wanna be without you, baby
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, baby
I don't want to play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no

I don't want a broken heart
And I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl

Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooo
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah
Ain't got to be afraid; my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away, away with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't wanna be without you, baby
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, baby
I don't want to play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no

I don't want a broken heart
I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
Broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl


Now I know, now that you don't love me no more, no more
You took my love and now you're gone, gone
You took my love and now you're gone

People say that you're not my kind, my kind
But you're always on my mind, my mind
Oh, you are always on my mind

Oh, you know I tried my best to give you happiness
Since the day, since the day we met
But it's so clear, my dear, you're treating me so unfair
Baby, I love you, yes, I love you but you don't care, care

People say that you're not my kind, my kind
But you're always on my mind, my mind
Oh, you are always on my mind
Oh, now I know that you are always on my mind
Now I know that love


You sit beside me
And I love you
But I hate you
I don't want to feel this way
But I can't stop
You reach for my hand
But I move it
Before you can
I won't let you have the
Power once again

So help me, God
To let this go
To let this go
So help me, God
Become what I believe
To break this hold
I'm afraid to leave
To find myself
I just need to breathe

You think you know me
But you changed me
Into somebody 
That I don't ever want to be again
I'm letting go now
Of this burden
I've been holding
I've been hurting myself now for way too long

It's not too late 
It's not too late
To leave it all behind
It's not too late
It's not too late


I'm so young and you're so old
This, my darling, I've been told
I don't care just what they say
Cause forever I will pray
You and I will be as free
As the birds up in the trees
Oh, please stay by me, Diana

Thrills I get when you hold me close
Oh, my darling, you're the most
I love you but do you love me
Oh, Diana, can't you see
I love you with all my heart
And I hope we will never part
Oh, please stay with me, Diana

Oh, my darlin, oh, my lover
Tell me that there is no other
I love you with my heart
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Only you can take my heart
Only you can tear it apart
When you hold me in your loving arms
I can feel you giving all your charms
Hold me, darling, ho-ho hold me tight
Squeeze me baby with all your might
Oh, please stay by me, Diana
Oh, please, Diana
Oh, please, Diana


No one knows what I go through
And the tears I cried for you
And when I smile, it's just a pose
My heart is breaking but no one knows

Friends won't learn the truth from me
I don't want their sympathy
You go to parties, dances and shows
I still love you but no one knows

Maybe some how, some time, some where
You'll walk by and hear my prayer
My loneliness will fade away
Darling please tell me you'll stay

But if you should pass me by
I'll be hurt but I won't cry
And though my love for you still grows
I feel it's better if no one knows


When I said I needed you
You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed but you
And now you've gone away

Don't you see that now you're gone
And I'm left here on my own

That I have to follow you
And beg you to come home

You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand

Believe me, believe me
I can't help but love you
But believe, I will never tie you down

Left alone with your memory
Life seems dead and so do we
All that's left is loneliness
There's nothing left to feel

You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand

Believe me, believe me
I can't help but love you
But believe, I will never tie you down

You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand

Believe me, believe me
I can't help but love you
But believe, I will never tie you down


I'm tempted my darling to steal you away
Don't let me cross over stay out of my way
You know that I love you but I'm not the stealing kind
Though I'm faced with heartaches at love's cheating line

Don't let me cross over love's cheating line
You belong to another and you'll never be mine
I know one step closer would be heaven divine
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line

I've tried to forget you but what else can I do
When your eyes keep saying that you love me too
I know if I lose you not a dream will I have left
I don't want to cheat dear but I can't help myself

Don't let me cross over love's cheating line
You belong to another and you'll never be mine
I know one step closer would be heaven divine
Don't let me cross over love's cheating line


I never was the biggest or the fastest guy
I never hit a homerun when the game was tied
I knew from an early age I wasn't going to be
A doctor or the CEO of anything

So I sang, She Believes In Me
And I played, Fire On The Mountain
Til I made my fingers bleed
I tried to stand out from the crowd
But most times I just struck out at the plate
So I sang

I wasn't cool enough to be a ladies man
It took me forever just to hold her hand
First time we kissed, she whispered, I love you
But I wasn't brave enough to say, I loved her too

So I sang, You Are So Beautiful To Me
And I played every note to Faithfully
I loved her with everything
But I couldn't think of anything to say
So I sang

No one believed in me as much as Mom
See, she worked overtime to buy my first guitar
When the angels called her home
My sister asked if I would speak
But there were no words to say how much she meant to me

So I sang, It Is Well With My Soul
And I played, I'm So Tired Of Being Alone
Cause those were Mama's favorite songs
And what I felt would take too long to say
So I sang
Yes, I sang
So I sang


My name is Ariel 
And I want to be free
It is your sorrow
That has made a slave of me
Forgive me
Forgive me
But you are all I know
Forgive me for leaving

The day is breaking now
It's time to go away
I'm so afraid to leave
But more afraid to stay
Forgive me
For leaving
The sadness in your eyes
Forgive me

Let the wind and ocean water
Wash across your hands
Wash away a thousand footsteps
Wash us all away
Like sand

The sky has fallen
Now the earth is dry and torn
I know you're tired
From the violence of the storm
I love you

I love you
But you are all I know
Forgive me, forgive me

Let the wind and ocean water
Wash across your hands
Wash away a thousand footsteps
Wash us all away

Let the wind and ocean water
Wash across your hands
Wash away a thousand memories
Wash us all away
Like sand

My name is Ariel


I've been watching you as of lately
Walking around like you're something to talk about
Like you bought into your own hype
Used to be just you and me baby
Running around like we had it all figured out
There's nothing left beyond those lies

Lie you're living such a lie

I wanna hold you but you're untouchable
Too cool, caught up in your ego
I wanna love you but you're making it impossible
Wanna believe you, but you're so far gone
Did you forget where you came from?
I wanna love you but you're making it impossible

When did you decided to get shady
I wanna know the moment you changed to someone new
I hate that you become that type
Hoping all the moments of maybe
Thinking about it, there's nothing to figure out
I see you gave in without a fight

Lie you're living such a lie

I wanna hold you but you're untouchable
Too cool, caught up in your ego
I wanna love you but you're making it impossible
Wanna believe you, but you're so far gone
Did you forget where you came from?
I wanna love you but you're making it impossible

I wanna hold you but you're untouchable
Too cool, caught up in your ego
I wanna love you but you're making it impossible
Wanna believe you, but you're so far gone
Did you forget where you came from?
I wanna love you but you're making it impossible

I wanna hold you but you're untouchable
Too cool, caught up in your ego
I wanna love you but you're making it impossible
Wanna believe you, but you're so far gone
Did you forget where you came from?
I wanna love you but you're making it impossible


I have a picture
It's taken with looks
It won't tell a story
But I'm glad I forgot everything that you say

I choose the colors
And reword the lines
Now somebody's second heart
Ain't the first of mine

Consider the rain now
Out in the cold
Maybe I love you
But our dreams grow old

Outbid my fortune
Out to just win
Tell me that summer
Is coming on in

I got my wallet
Been shot from the start
Feel shot when I'm feeling drained
But we all know how to smile when we're falling apart

You choose the colours now
Let's play with the rest
I never believe at all
But some of us sometimes, are just thrilled, by meeting the blessed

Consider the rain now
Out in the cold
Maybe I love you
But our dreams grow old

Outbid my fortune
Out to just win
Tell me that summer
Is coming on in

I have the oath ring, somebody said
Makes like a twinge running straight through my head
Maybe this fortune is not what it seems
Some of us pin, some of us pin time on our dreams

And saved from the talk shifts
Went straight to your goal
Straight backed and straight laced
Well, you never really 
Do you ever really know?

I check on the same day
I checked out the view
I checked all the soft land
Well, it comes so easy from you

Consider the rain now
Out in the cold
Maybe I love you
But our dreams grow old

Outbid my fortune
Out to just win
Tell me that summer
Is coming on in


You keep saying you love him I believe that it's true
And it just doesn't matter how much I love you
But in time your'll understand dear when you shed a tear
Then you'll know you were living in your tender years
In your eyes there's a love light that shines just for him
But how long will it stay there will that love light grow dim
You can just see the happiness you can't see the tears
It's true cause you're living in your tender years
If I can't be your first love I'll wait and be your last
I'll be somewhere in your future to help you forget your past
And you'll know that I love you with the love that's sincere
Cause I'll wait till you're through living in your tender years
And you'll know that I love you with the love that's sincere
Cause I'll wait till you're through living in your tender years


Ask me why I came so late
Ask me why I made you wait
Here's a story
That you ought to know
I had a little fight
I was dancing at a go-go
I'll tell you anything
Baby, except the truth

I'll tell you anything
Baby, except the truth
I've got nothing
But everything to prove

I only smile when I tell a lie
I swear the only one tonight

Ask me if I can be true
Ask me where I'm going to
I say I love you
But you ought to know
I only love the night
And I always got's to go-go
I'll tell you anything
Baby, except the truth


Thought I'd stop by awhile
And see you just once more before I leave town
But his car's parked there in your driveway
And I see the curtain's pulled down

I won't bother to ring your doorbell
I'm not sure just how much I can bear
I might do something I'd be sorry for later
So I won't come in while he's there

Does he know my whole world is in there with him
That he's king while he sits there in my chair?
I'd like to tell you just how much I still love you
But I won't come in while he's there
No, I won't come in while he's there


Come to me baby
Holdin my hand
Come to me baby
Lovin a man
I give you lovin
Feeling my pain
You tell me nothing
I go in vain
I hit the road I'm in the mood
I gotta see somebody
Turn out your love
And what'll you do , honey?
If I start
I know I love you
But guess I'm but jokin
Come to me baby
Tell you no lie
Come to me baby
Don't ask me why
Someone says that
You movin away
I tell you if I'm
Seein a lay


Millions, Like Stars In My Hands, Daggers In My Heart, Wage War_
Together. As if in silent prayer.
And whenever I looked out, you were there.
Love flowed from our hearts.
How could we ever,
Stand to be apart?

Don't throw your faith in others away,
Because we have ended this way.
Don't ever think I don't care about you,
What you've always know is true.
It always seems sad, things have to change.
Like our feelings, let's not look for blame.
Don't throw your faith in others away,
Because we have ended this way.

Don't ever think I don't care about you,
What you've always known is true.
After all is said and done, I am the sorry one.
Why must we hurt the people we love?
It's like my destiny falls on me from above.
I love you but I can't hang on anymore.
I love you but I can't stay anymore.


I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill when I found you
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill
And lingered until my dreams came true

The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be

Though we're apart, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill

I found my thrill
Come climb the hill with me, baby
On Blueberry Hill
We'll see what we shall see
On Blueberry Hill
I'll bring my horn with me
When I found you
I'll be wit you where berries are blue
The moon stood still
Each afternoon we'll go
On Blueberry Hill
Higher than the moon we'll go
And lingered until
Then, to a weddin in June we'll go
My dreams came true
Ba-ba-da-de-buzz-buzz va-de-n-da-day

The wind in the willow played 
Do you really love me
Love's sweet melody 
As I love you
But all of those vows we made 
Will you still remember
Were never to be 
When the night is through

Though we're apart, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill


I'm just a child trying to be a woman
And you
Ah you are a strange one
Tryin
To be my man
Ah lying here so close to me tryin
I love you I love you I love you
But it's so hard for me to be me
I wish I could give to you
I'd be free I'd be free I'd be free
Ah then I could be me
I'm just a child trying to be a woman
And you

Ah you are a strange one trying to be
My friend
Ah lyin here telling me what you feel tryin
I need you I need you I need you
But it's so hard for me to be me
I wish I could live for you
I'd be free I'd be free I'd be free
Ah then I could be me
I'm just a child trying to be a woman
And you
You are a strange one
Trying not to be a child.


We belong here, we belong here
Ain't nobody that can tell us we're wrong
Help me say, say this to you
I'll be by your side, see you through

I promise you that I will keep you safe from harm
Love you all the rest of my days
When the night is silent and we seem so far away
Oh I love you but I don't know what to say

I was lost, I was lost
Tried to find the balance, got caught up in the cost
Let it go, when I met you
All the clouds parted, all that light came shining through

I promise you I will keep you safe from harm
And love you all the rest of my days
When the night is silent and we seem so far away
Oh I love you and I don't know what to say

I promise you that I will keep you safe from harm
And love you all the rest of my days
When the night is silent and we seem so far away
Oh I love you and I don't know what to say
Oh I love you and I don't know what to say


She asked him for forever
And a promise that would last
He said, babe you know I love you
But I can't commit to that
She said, love isn't love
Till you give it away

A father lived in silence
Saw his son become a man
There was a distance felt between them
Cause he could not understand
That love isn't love
Till you give it away
You gotta give it away

As we live
Moving side by side
May we learn to give
Learn to sacrifice

We can entertain compassion
For a world in need of care
But the road of good intentions
Doesn't lead to anywhere
Cause love isn't love
Till you give it away
You gotta give it away

As we live
Moving side by side
May we learn to give
Learn to sacrifice

Love is like a river
Flowing down from the giver of life
We drink from the water
And our thirst is no longer denied
You gotta give it away

As we live
Moving side by side
May we learn to give
Learn to sacrifice

There was a man who walked on water
He came to set the people free
He was the ultimate example
Of what love can truly be
Cause his love was his life
And he gave it away
You gotta give it away

As we live
Moving side by side
May we learn to give
Learn to sacrifice


Baby, I love you, yes I do
Baby, I love you, yes I do

I don't know why I love you but I do
Girl, I'm crazy, oh Lord, I'm crazy about you
You entered my life and upset my dreams
You've been a part of me all my life it seems, oh

Baby, I love you, yes I do
Baby, I love you, yes I do

I'm all alone because I can't stand the crowds
You see the talking and the laughter, oh, it's much too loud
I'm gonna sit here all alone
Hoping while I pray that 

Baby, I love you, yes I do
Baby, I love you, yes I do
Baby, I love you, yes I do

Oh, Lord my hair, my hair is turning gray
Like a fool I've wasted most of my life away
I'm gonna dry away all these tears
Try to enjoy my last few years

Though I'm leaving you on your own
Don't forget to pray for me, darling, while I'm gone
Go to church, oh Lord, and light a candle
Oh, but don't forget me

Baby, I love you, yes I do
Baby, I love you, yes I do
Baby, I love you, yes I do

Oh, London, where the clouds never go away
I keep my coat on from September till May
When the tulips will bloom in the most unusual way.
Oh, London, I love you, but the clouds never go away.

Oh, London, where it's goomy in the fall
I can't shake this sadness cause it's never that small.
But we're all sad together, so I'm not alone at all,
Oh, London, I'll leave you, but the sky will always fall.

Oh, London, where the daffodils grow
Each one like a fireball at the end of the meadow
And I always forget there, I could've felt so low
Oh London, I'll forget you so I'll never have to go.
