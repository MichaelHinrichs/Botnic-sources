I'm a little unlike
You before things had changed
In a compass, I ride
All this feels rearranged
Tell me, does it matter
If I'm still here, or I'm gone
Shifting to the after
An impostor, I'm not the one you know I look the same outside
Nearly me even though
I carry something I hide
Underneath the one you know
Tell me, does it matter
If I'm still here, or I'm gone
Shifting to the after
An impostor, so disowned
Are you surprised black water flows
From wells run dry
I'm not the one you know
Lay me out with our guilt
Watch the explosions fall, rain
Cannot live within this tilt
Carryin over
I'm not the one you know
Tell me, does it matter
If I'm still here, or I'm gone
Shifting to the after
An impostor, so disowned
Are you surprised black water flows
From wells run dry
I'm not the one you know
I'm not the one you know
Silent grieve
Suffocates the rumor
Feel my breathing
Speed up at the thought of you
My inner voice
Seems to want me dead
Only choice
Manage down the trail I've lead
Never far away away i always see you
When it all goes dark you light my way through
Never fade
I know you think you're someone i forgot
Never fade
I'm everything you really think I'm not
Never fade
I know you think you're someone I forgot
Never fade
Growing cold
Try to numb my feeling
Lose control
All my friends are leaving
Paid the price
For all the lies I used to live
Sacrifice
For all the love I tried to give
Never far away i always see you
When it all goes dark you light my way through
Never fade
I know you think you're someone I forgot
Never fade
I'm everything you really think I'm not
Never fade
I know you think you're someone I forgot
Never fade
Never fade
I know you think you're someone I forgot
Never fade
I'm everything you really think I'm not
Never fade
I know you think you're someone I forgot
Never fade
I'm everything you really think I'm not
Never fade
Never fade
Never fade
We chase misprinted lies
We face the path of time
And yet I fight
And yet I fight
This battle all alone
No one to cry to
No place to call home
Oooh.
Oooh.
Oooh.
Oooh.
My gift of self is raped
My privacy is raked
And yet I find
And yet I find
Repeating in my head
If I can't be my own
I'd feel better dead
Oooh.
Oooh.
Oooh.
Oooh.
Bury me softly in this womb
I give this part of me for you
Sand rains down and here I sit
Holding rare flowers
In a tomb, in bloom
Down in a hole, and I don't know if I can be saved
See my heart, I decorate it like a grave
You don't understand who they thought I was supposed to be
Look at me now, a man
Who won't let himself be
Down in a hole
Feeling so small
Down in a hole
Losing my soul
I'd like to fly
But my wings have been so denied
Down in a hole, and they've put all the stones in their place
I've eaten the sun so my tongue has been burned of the taste
I have been guilty of kicking myself in the teeth
I will speak no more of my feelings beneath
Down in a hole
Feeling so small
Down in a hole
Losing my soul
I'd like to fly
But my wings have been so denied
Bury me softly in this womb
Oh I want to be inside of you
I give this part of me for you
Oh I want to be inside of you
Sand rains down and here I sit
Holding rare flowers
Oh I want to be inside of you
In a tomb
Oh I want to be inside
Down in a hole
Feeling so small
Down in a hole
Losing my soul
Down in a hole
Feeling so small
Down in a hole
Out of control
I'd like to fly
But my wings have been so denied
Ain't found a way to kill me yet
Eyes burn with stinging sweat
Seems every path leads me to nowhere, mmm
Wife and kids household pet
Army green was no safe bet
The bullets scream to me from somewhere, mmm
Here they come to snuff the rooster, oh yeah
Yeah here come the rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, no oh, you know he ain't gonna die
Here they come to snuff the rooster, oh yeah
Yeah here come the rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die, oh
No, no, no oh, you know he ain't gonna die
Walkin tall machine gun men
They spit on me in my home land
Gloria sent me pictures of my boy, mmm
Got my pills gainst mosquito death
My buddy's breathing his dyin breath
Oh
God please won't you help me make it through
Here they come to snuff the rooster, oh yeah
Yeah here come the rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, no oh, you know he ain't gonna die I'm the man in the box, buried in my shit
Won't you come and save me, save me?
Feed my eyes, can you sew them shut?
Jesus
Christ, deny your maker
He who tries, will be wasted
Feed my eyes, now you've sewn them shut
I'm the dog who gets beat, shove my nose in shit
Won't you come and save me, save me?
Feed my eyes, can you sew them shut?
Jesus
Christ, deny your maker
He who tries, will be wasted
Feed my eyes, now you've sewn them shut
Feed my eyes, can you sew them shut?
Jesus
Christ, deny your maker
He who tries, will be wasted
Feed my eyes, now you've sewn them shut
Know me broken by my master
Teach thee on child, love hereafter
Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way
Drifting body it's sole desertion
Flying not yet quite the notion
Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way
Into the flood again
Same old trip it was back then
So I made a big mistake
Try to see it once my way
Am I wrong?
Have I run too far to get home
Have I gone?
And left you here alone
Am I wrong?
Have I run too far to get home, yeah
Have I gone?
And left you here alone
If I would, could you?
It's alright
there comes a time
got no patience to search
for peace of mind
Layin low
want to take it slow
no more hiding or
disguising truths I've sold
Everyday it's something
hits me all so cold
find me sittin by myself
no excuses, that I know
It's okay
had a bad day
hands are bruised from
breaking rocks all day
Drained and blue
I bleed for you
you think it's funny, well
you're drowning in it too
Everyday it's something
hits me all so cold
find me sittin by myself
no excuses, that I know
Yeah, it's fine
we'll walk down the line
leave our rain,
a cold trade for warm sunshine
You my friend
I will defend
and if we change, well
I love you anyway
Everyday it's something
hits me all so cold
find me sittin by myself
no excuses, that I know
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!  I believe them bones are me 
Some say we're born into the grave 
I feel so alone 
Gonna end up a big ol pile of them bones 
Ah!
Ah!
Ahhhhh! 
Dust rise right on over my time 
Empty fossil of the new scene 
I feel so alone 
Gonna end up a big ol pile of them bones 
Toll due, bad dream come true 
I lie dead gone under red sky 
I feel so alone 
Gonna end up a big ol pile of them 
I feel so alone 
Gonna end up a big ol pile of them 
I feel so alone 
Gonna end up a big ol pile of them bones
It's been a long day at the bottom of the hill,
she died of a broken heart.
She told me i was living in the past,
drinking from a broken glass. I'm alone 
I never wanna be alone
,
now i 
now i
 turn to face the cold.
I'm alone 
I never wanna be alone
,
now i 
now i
 turn to travel home. I walked down to the other end of the day,
just to catch those last few waves.
I held out my hand and slowly waved goodbye,
i turned now my eyes up to the sky. I'm alone 
I never wanna be alone
,
now i 
now i
 turn to face the cold.
I'm alone 
I never wanna be alone
,
now i 
now i
 turn to travel home.
She'll come back to me 
She'll come back to me

She'll come back to me 
She'll come back to me

All alone in this misery.
She'll come back to me. I held out my hands into the light and i watched it die,
i know that i was part to play.
My god, my time to die.
Never want to spend my life alone I'm alone 
I never wanna be alone
,
now i 
now i
 turn to face the cold.
I'm alone 
I never wanna be alone
,
now i 
now i
 turn to travel home.
Yeah, I want to travel south this year
Aaah,
Woah,
Woah
Won't prevent safe passage here
Why you act crazy
Not an act maybe
So close a lady
Shifty eyes shady
Yeah, hey
Yeah, tears that soak
A callous heart
Why you act frightened
I am enlightened
Your weakness builds me
So someday you'll see I stay away
Why you act crazy
Not an act maybe
So close a lady
Shifty eyes shady I stay away
I stay away
I stay away
I stay away I'm a little unlike
You before things had changed
In a compass, I ride
All this feels rearranged
Tell me, does it matter
If I'm still here, or I'm gone
Shifting to the after
An impostor, I'm not the one you know I look the same outside
Nearly me even though
I carry something I hide
Underneath the one you know
Tell me, does it matter
If I'm still here, or I'm gone
Shifting to the after
An impostor, so disowned
Are you surprised black water flows
From wells run dry
I'm not the one you know
Lay me out with our guilt
Watch the explosions fall, rain
Cannot live within this tilt
Carryin over

Shifting to the after
An impostor, so disowned
Are you surprised black water flows
From wells run dry
I'm not the one you know
I'm not the one you know I tried to love you I thought I could
I tried to own you I thought I would
I want to peel the skin from your face
before the real you lays to waste you told me I'm the only one
sweet little angel you should have run
lying, crying, dying to leave
innocence creates my hell cheating myself still you know more
it would be so easy with a whore
try to understand me little girl
my twisted passion to be your world lost inside my sick head
I live for you but I'm not alive
take my hand before I kill
I still love you, but, I still burn
yeah, love, hate, love
yeah, love, hate, love
yeah, love, hate, love
Mmm oooh, love, hate, love
yeah, love, hate, love 
Junk,
Fuck
 A good night, the best in a long time
A new friend turned me on to an old favorite
Nothing better than a dealer who's high
Be high, convince them to buy
What's my drug of choice?
Well, what have you got?
I don't go broke
And I do it a lot
Seem so sick to the hypocrite norm
Running their boring drills
But we are an elite race of our own
The stoners, junkies and freaks
Are you happy? I am, man
Content and fully aware
Money, status, nothing to me.
Cause your life is empty and bare
What's my drug of choice?
Well, what have you got?
I don't go broke
And I do it a lot
You can't understand a user's mind
But try with your books and degrees
If you let yourself go and opened your mind
I'll bet you'd be doing like me
And it ain't so bad
What's my drug of choice?
Well, what have you got?
Say I don't go broke
And I do it a lot
Say, I do it a lot!
Say, I do it a lot!
Say, I do it a lot!
Say, I do it a lot!
Hey, I ain't never coming home
Hey, I'll just wander my own road
Hey hey, I can't meet you here tomorrow
No say goodbye, don't follow
Misery so hollow
Hey you, you're livin life full throttle
Hey you, pass me down that bottle
Hey hey you, you can't shake me round now
I get so lost and don't know how
And it hurts to care, I'm going down
Forgot my woman, lost my friends
Things I'd done, where I've been
Sleep in sweat the mirrors cold
See my face, it's growin old
Scared to death no reason why
Do whatever to get me by
Think about the things I said
Read the page it's cold and dead
And take me home
And take me home, home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home, home
Say goodbye, don't follow
Ain't found a way to kill me yet
Eyes burn with stinging sweat
Seems every path leads me to nowhere
Wife and kids, household pet
Army green was no safe bet
The bullets scream to me from somewhere
Yeah they come to snuff the rooster
Yeah here come the rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die

Walkin tall machine gun man
They spit on me in my home land
Gloria sent me pictures of my boy
Got my pills gainst mosquito death
My buddy's breathin his dyin breath
Oh god please won't you help me make it through
Yeah they come to snuff the rooster, ah yeah
Yeah here come the rooster, yeah
You know he ain't gonna die
No, no, you know he ain't gonna die
Sitting on an angry chair
Angry walls that steal the air
Stomach hurts and I don't care
What do I see across the way, hey
See myself molded in clay, oh
Stares at me, yeah I'm afraid, hey
Changing the shape of his face, aw yeah
Candles red I have a pair
Shadows dancing everywhere
Burning on the angry chair
Little boy made a mistake, hey
Pink cloud has now turned to gray, oh
All that I want is to play, hey
Get on your knees, time to pray, boy I don't mind, yeah
I don't mind, I I I
I don't mind, yeah
I don't mind, I I I
Lost my mind, yeah
But I don't mind, I I I
Can't find it anywhere
I don't mind
Corporate prison, we stay, hey
I'm a dull boy, work all day, oh
So I'm strung out anyway, hey
Loneliness is not a phase
Field of pain is where I graze
Serenity is far away
Saw my reflection and cried, hey
So little hope that I died, oh
Feed me your lies, open wide, hey
Weight of my heart, not the size, oh I don't mind, yeah
I don't mind, I I I
I don't mind, yeah
I don't mind, I I I
Lost my mind, yeah
But I don't mind, I I I
Can't find it anywhere
I don't mind, I I I
Pink cloud has now turned to gray
All that I want is to play
Get on your knees time to pray, boy
Yeah, it goes away
All of this and more of nothing in my life
No colored clay
Individuality not safe
As of now I bet you got me wrong
So unsure you run from something strong I can't let go
Threadbare tapestry unwinding slow
Feel a tortured brain
Show your belly like you want me to
As of now I bet you got me wrong
So unsure we reach for something
Strong, I haven't felt like this in so long
Wrong, in a sense too far gone from love
That don't last forever
Somethings gotta turn out right
You sugar taste
Sweetness doesn't often touch my face
Stay if you please
You may not be here when I leave
As of now I bet you got me wrong
So unsure we reach for something strong
Strong, I haven't felt like this in so long
Wrong, in a sense too far gone from love
Strong, I haven't felt like this in so long
Wrong, in a sense too far gone from love
That don't last forever
Somethings gotta turn out right
Be what you wanna be
See what you came to see
Been what you wanna be
I don't like what I see
Like the coldest winter chill
Heaven beside you, hell within
Like the coldest winter chill
Heaven beside you, hell within
Like the coldest winter will
Heaven beside you, hell within
And you think you have it still, heaven inside you
So there's problems in your life
That's fucked up, and I'm not blind
I'm just see through faded, super jaded
And out of my mind
Do what you wanna do
Go out and seek your truth
When I'm down and blue
Rather be me than you
Like the coldest winter chill
Heaven beside you, hell within
Like the coldest winter chill
Heaven beside you, hell within
Like the coldest winter will
Heaven beside you, hell within
And you wish you had it still, heaven inside you
So there's problems in your life
That's fucked up, and I'm not blind
I'm just see through faded, super jaded
And out of my mind
Like the coldest winter chill
Heaven beside you, hell within
Like the coldest winter chill
Heaven beside you, hell within
Like the coldest winter will
Heaven beside you, hell within
And you know you have it still, heaven inside you
So there's problems in your life
That's fucked up, but you're not blind
You're just see through faded, overrated
And out of your mind
Yeah, it's over now,
but I can breathe somehow
When it's all worn out,
I'd rather go without
You know its been on my mind
Could you stand right there
Look me straight in the eye and say
That it's over now
We pay our debt sometime
Well it's over now,
yet I can see somehow
When its all gone wrong,
it's hard to be so strong
You know its been on my mind
Could you stand right there
Look me straight in the eye and say
That it's over now
We pay our debt sometime
Yeah, we pay our debt sometime
We pay our debt sometime
Yeah, we pay our debt sometime
Guess it's over now,
I seem alive somehow
When it's out of sight,
just wait and do your time
You know its been on my mind
Could I stand right here
Look myself in the eye and say
That it's over now
We pay our debt sometime
Yeah, we pay our debt sometime
We pay our debt sometime
Yeah, we pay our debt sometime
Turning in circles, slowing down
Pulling against a closing out
Easy to feed off a weaker thing
Harder to say what I really mean
Hollow as a mountain all tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain crowned with a cold, blue sky
All of your colors turn to grey
Don't even matter anyway
Bleeding impressions where you were tied
Can't really say how you lost your mind
Hollow as a mountain all tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain crowned with a cold
Hollow as a mountain all tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain crowned with a cold, blue sky
Silence so loud, silence
I can't tell my up from down
Silence so loud, silence
I can't tell my uṗ from down
All of the faces life can show
Withered and ugly the one you know
Hollow as a mountain all tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain crowned with a cold, blue sky
Silence so loud, silence
I can't tell my up from down
Silence so loud,
Silence
I can't tell my up from down
Mind
Of destructive taste
I chose
To stroll amongst the waste
That was your heart
Lost in the dark
Call off the chase
Walls of thought
Strong and high
As my castle
Crumbles with time
I think of you
Oh, yes I do
Such a crime
You opened fire
And your mark was true
You opened fire
Aim my smilin skull at you
You opened fire I live tomorrow
You I'll not follow
As you wallow
In a sea of sorrow
Lines cut across my face
Why you laugh at my disgrace
I'll never know
How far to go
To reach that place
You opened fire
And your mark was true
You opened fire
Aim my smilin skull at you
You opened fire I live tomorrow
You I'll not follow
As you wallow
In a sea of sorrow
You opened fire
And your mark was true
You opened fire
Aim my smilin skull at you
You opened fire I live tomorrow
You I'll not follow
As you wallow
In a sea of sorrow I live tomorrow
You I'll not follow
As you wallow
In a sea of sorrow
I live tomorrow
You I'll not follow
As you wallow
In a sea of sorrow
I live tomorrow
You I'll not follow
As you wallow
In a sea of sorrow
Time to change has come and gone
Watched your fears become your god
It's your decision
It's your decision
Overwhelmed, you chose to run
Apathetic to the stunned
It's your decision
It's your decision
You feed the fire that burned us all
When you lied
To feel the pain that spurs you on
Black inside
No-one plans to take the path that brings you nowhere
Here you stand before us all and say it's over
It's over 
Guitar
Solo by
Jerry
Cantrell
It might seem an after thought
Yes it hurts to know you're bought
It's your decision
It's your decision
You feed the fire that burned us all
When you lied
To feel the pain that spurs you on
Black inside
It's your decision
It's your decision
No-one plans to take the path that brings you nowhere
Here you stand before us all and say it's over
It's over
It's over. I know you think I'm wrong but I'm not your tour guide
Have a guess, I don't let you look inside
Cold dry stone
What makes you want to carve your initials in me?
Rained and weathered, erasing, hard to read
Find me distant, outwardly rough, obscene
Cold dry stone
Cold and dry a stone
Cold and dry a stone I'm not a cornerstone in a palace for you
Time will bring your very own hard truth
Not to worry, ice covered rocks still move
Cold dry stone
Cold dry stone I could climb until I reach where angels reside
Ask around to find out where the junkies applied
You just up and left me on this rock all alone
It's my fault for knowing not what I should have known
Ohhhh oh oh
My heart is tired of beating slow
Ohh ohh
It's been depleting since you, died
Since you, died
You died I could drop until I touch the sinister side
Visit all attractions flippin back and aside
Still you leave me rotting on this rock all alone
It's my fault for knowing not what I should have known
Ohhhh oh oh
My heart is tired of beating slow
Ohh ohh
It's been depleting since you, died
Since you, died
You died
Ohhh oh oh
My heart is tired of beating slow
Ohh ohh
It's been depleting since you died
Since you died
You died I could climb until I reach where angels reside
I could drop until I touch the sinister side
Ohhhh oh
My heart is tired of beating slow
Uhh ohh
It's been depleting since you, died
Since you, died
You died
Died
You died
Died
You died
My cup runneth over
Like blood from a stone
These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I'd like to see
How you all would bleed for me
When the pig runs slower
Let the arrow fly
When the sin lies bolder
I'll pluck out thine eye
These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I'd like to see
How you all would bleed for me
If you scorn my lover
Satan got your thigh
If you steal in hunger
I will kick you when you try
These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I'd like to see
How you all would bleed for me 
In
Background
 All these things that you've done for me,
Have left me so. FUCKING TIRED
I'm not saying that you haven't done a lot of good,
But if there's one thing you can do,
You can BLEED FOR ME, BLEED FOR ME
These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I'd like to see
How you all would bleed for me
These stand for me
Name your god and bleed the freak
I like to see
How you all would bleed for me I don't want to feel no more
It's easier to keep falling
Imitations are pale
Emptiness. all tomorrows
Haunted by your ghost
Lay down, black gives way to blue
Lay down, I'll remember you
Fading out by design
Consciously avoiding changes
Curtain's drawn, now it's done
Silencing all tomorrows
Forcing a goodbye
Lay down, black gives way to blue
Lay down, I'll remember you
So I found myself in the sun, oh yeah
A hell of a place to end a run, oh yeah
California, I'm fine
Somebody check my brain
California's all right
Somebody check my brain
Check my brain I walk these streets, I creep and I fall, oh yeah
When she sang I answered the call, oh yeah
California, I'm fine
Somebody check my brain
California's all right
Somebody check my brain
Ahhhhhhh
Tears that filled my bong
Ahhhhhhh
Years expended gone I hung my guns and put em away, oh yeah
The trick of the trade, and by the way, oh yeah
California, I'm fine
Somebody check my brain
California's all right
Somebody check my brain
Ahhhhhhh
Tears that filled my bong
Ahhhhhhh
Years expended gone
Ahhhhhhh
Tears that filled my bong
Ahhhhhhh
Years expended gone
Check my brain
Eh eh eh. I have never felt such frustration
Or lack of self control
I want you to kill me
And dig me under, I wanna live no more
One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
For me I want to taste dirty, stinging pistol
In my mouth, on my tongue
I want you to scrape me from the walls
And go crazy like you've made me
One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
For me
Yeih.
Yeih.
You, you are so special
You have the talent to make me feel like dirt
And you, you use your talent to dig me under
And cover me with dirt
One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me
Eh eh eh.

Hey ah na na
Hey ah na na

Hey ah na na
What's gone wrong, I can't see straight
Been too long, so full of hate
What the fuck will it take
Drown myself in my wake
Another shaggy D.A.
Now a dog, shake my leg
Plastic man, paper face
Candy heart, what a waste
Gotta change, set a date
Eat my cake, lick my plate
Stare at me with empty eyes and point your words at me
Mirror on the wall will show you what you're scared to see I can see, wish I couldn't see at all
I can feel, wish I couldn't feel at all
Hate to see, wish I couldn't see at all
Hate to feel, wish I couldn't feel at all
So climb the walls, thin my blood now
And I crawl, back to bed now
What the hell, gotta rest
Aching pain in my chest
Lucky me, now I'm set
Little bug for a pet
New
Orleans, gotta get
Pin cushion medicine
Used to be curious
Now the shit's sustenance
All this time I swore I'd never be like my old man
What the hey it's time to face exactly what I am I can see, wish I couldn't see at all
I can feel, wish I couldn't feel at all
Hate to see, wish I couldn't see at all
Hate to feel, wish I couldn't feel at all, Solo
What the hell, gotta rest
Aching pain in my chest
Lucky me, now I'm set
Little bug for a pet
New
Orleans, gotta get
Pin cushion medicine
Used to be curious
Now the shit's sustenance
All this time I swore I'd never be like my old man
What the hey it's time to face exactly who I am I can see, wish I couldn't see at all
I can feel, wish I couldn't feel at all
Hate to see, wish I couldn't see at all
Hate to feel, wish I couldn't feel at all I can see, wish I couldn't see at all
I can feel, wish I couldn't feel at all
Hate to see, wish I couldn't see at all
Hate to feel, wish I couldn't feel at all
The face before me flies
Laughs at me inside
Masks are made to hide the glow, shining eyes
Distance tween us grows, feeding lies
It's hard to start things over
You can feel the fire around us
All the time, yeah
Something I should say
It takes you every day
What you give is not alive, today
Your soul served on a plate, thrown away
It's hard to start things over
You can feel the fire around us
All the time, yeah
It's hard to start things over, oh yeah
You can feel the fire around us
All the time, yeah
It's hard to start things over, oh yeah
You can feel the fire around us
All the time, yeah
All the time
What the hell have I,
Led awry? I am iron god!
Glen
Red-rum, red-rum, red-rum
Yeah
There I was, laid out on a table
Screamin sweat and bare feet to the floor
In my life, I'd not soften
Things that cut and burn so often
But I sit, think of somethin
Scared to face, the dyin nothin
See the cycle I've waited for
It ain't like that anymore
Yeah
Where I go is when I feel I'm able
How I fight is why I'm feelin sore
In my mind, not forgotten
Feel as though, a tooth were rotten
Behind the smile, a tongue that's slippin
Buzzards cry when flesh is rippin
See the cycle I've waited for
It ain't like that anymore
Here I sit writing on the paper
Trying to think of words you can't ignore
In my eyes, what I'm lacking
Score at face, a ten for slacking
Sign the deal, set in motion
Smaller fish, so huge the ocean
See the cycle I've waited for
It ain't like that anymore
See the cycle I've waited for
It ain't like that anymore
Scary's on the wall
Scary's on his way
Watch where you spit
I'd advise you wait until it's over
Then you got hit
And you shoulda known better
And we die young

Faster we run
Down, down, down you're rollin
Watch the blood float in the muddy sewer
Take another hit
And bury your brother

And we die young

Faster we run

Scary's on the wall
Scary's on his way
Another alley trip
Bullet seek the place to bend you over
Then you got hit
And you shoulda known better
Faster we run
And we die young

Owe.
Oh yeah.
Owe.
Oh yeah.
Owe
You insult me in my home
You're forgiven this time
Things go well, you're eyes dilate
You shake, and I'm high
Look in my eyes deep and watch
The clouds change with time
20 hours won't print
My picture milk carton size
Carton size, carton size, carton size
Call me up congratulations
Ain't the real why
There's no pressures besides brilliance
Let's say by day 9
Endless corporate ignorance lets
Me control time
By the way, by the way 
echo
Once again you see an in
Discolored skin gives you away
So afraid you kindly gurgle out a date
For me
Owe.
Oh yeah.
Owe.
Oh yeah.
Owe
Now the body of one soul I adore
Wants to die
You have always told me you'd
Not live past 25
I say stay long enough to repay
all who caused strife
Once again you see an in
Discolored skin gives you away
So afraid you kindly gurgle out a date
For me
Once again you see an in
Discolored skin gives you away
So afraid you kindly gurgle out a date
For me
Owe.
Oh yeah.
Owe.
Oh yeah 
I bear true and an existing witness to this barrel of monkeys. A self-proclaimed immoral success, perfected by each whereof; individually deadly, and equally so and spread about the surrendered troops, for even thousands of miles cannot tear apart their communication, or the lack thereof.
Vultures, liars, thieves: each proclaim their innocence in no suggestion or rhyme, your weapon is contained in the wrecking of keeping the desired effect.
The breaking of the spirit thwarts the whole being.
Your weapon is guilt
Your weapon is guilt
Your weapon is guilt
Guilt
Sat suffering, I knew him when
Fair-weather friends of mine
Try not to think, I merely blink
Hope to wish away the lies.
Can you protect
Me when I'm wrecked
I pretend you're still alive
Yeah. 
Who denied all.
And tied all the lies
Who denied all.
And tied all the lies
 I choose the day, one damp and gray
Thick fog to hide our smiles
Clear all your sins
Get born again
Just repeat a couple lines
Lines.
Lines.
Lines.
yeah 
Who denied all.
And tied all the lies
Can you protect
Me when I'm wrecked
I pretend you're still alive I choose the day,
One damp and gray
Thick fog to hide our smiles
Sat suffering
Who denied all.
And tied all the lies
Get born again
Who denied all.
And tied all the lies
Sat suffering
Who denied all.
And tied all the lies
Get born again
Who denied all.
And tied all the lies
Sat suffering
Who denied all.
And tied all the lies
Get born again
Who denied all.
And tied all the lies
Sat suffering
Who denied all.
And tied all the lies
Get born again
Who denied all.
And tied all the lies
Sat suffering
Who denied all.
And tied all the lies
Get born again
Who denied all.
And tied all the lies
Instrumental
Who am I, is this me?
Am I one of the team?
I've gone cold, hard to deal
Used to stand where I kneel
Everybody listen
Voices in my head
Everybody listen
Does yours say what mine says? I want more, than I need
I don't know what is real
Everybody listen
Voices in my head
Everybody listen
Does yours say what mine says?
Anytime I listen
Voices in my head
Everybody listen
Does yours say what mine says?
Whispering their names, faces, uniforms I've worn
And now that is gone
Always climbing, to fall down again
Holding onto everything that's not what it seems I've been told, dreaming's free
Think I'll go back to sleep
Everybody listen
Voices in my head
Everybody listen
Does yours say what mine says?
Anytime I listen
Voices in my head
Everybody listen
Does yours say what mine says?
Calling out the names, faces, uniforms I've worn
And all that is gone
Always climbing, to fall down again
Holding onto everything that's not what it seems
One a-one time, yeah.
Am I too contagious
Full of sick desire
Am I that I promise
Burning corpsed pyre
Then some dude came down to touch the
Mother.
Mother touched 
and dude ain't here no more.
Suck your woman down.
Am I your reflection
Melting mirror smile
Am I worth the value
Do my love defile
Then some dude came down to touch the
Mother.
Mother touched and dude ain't here no more.
Ain't no day the sun don't crack.
Try brand some name across my back, so you care?
Find someone to tell you.
Sunshine, sweet love my labor.
Don't mind, I don't care no more.
Memory, set me free, yeah.
I don't care no more
Mother please, come for me
Can you face the question?
Is my soul entire?
Sunshine, sweet love my labor
Don't mind, I don't care no more
Sunshine, sweet love my labor
Don't mind, I don't care no more I broke you in the canyon
I drowned you in the lake
You, a snake that I would trample
Only thing i'd not embrace
Oh, you couldn't dam that river
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway
So you couldn't dam that river
And it washed me so far away I pushed and then you stumbled
I kicked you in the face
You stare at me so hollow
Got to keep that killin pace
Oh, you couldn't dam that river
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway
So you couldn't dam that river
And it washed me so far away I burned the place around you
I hit you with a rake
You piss upon my candle
So proving you're a fake
Oh, you couldn't dam that river
And maybe i don't give a damn anyway
So you couldn't dam that river
And it washed me so far away
Care not for the men who wonder
Straw that broke your back, you're under
Cast all them aside who care
Empty eyes and dead end stare
Don't you know that none are blind
To the lie, and you think I don't find what you hide?
What in
God's name have you done?
Stick your arm for some real fun
For the horse you've grown much fonder
Than for me, that I don't ponder
As the hair of one who bit you
Smiling bite your own self, too
And I think that you're not blind
To the ones you left behind
I'll be here
What in
God's name have you done?
Stick your arm for some real fun
So be yearning all your life
Twisting, turning like a knife
Now you know the reasons why
Can't get high, or you will die
Or you'll die
What in
God's name have you done?
Stick your arm for some real fun
So your sickness weighs a ton
And
God's name is smack for some
Give away a love
And then remove another too
Painted words adorn the walls
Echoing untrue
I feel cold. uh huh
Promises abound
You rarely find it to begin
Maybe I'm afraid to let you
All the way in
I guess so. uh huh I excuse myself
I'm used to my little cell
I amuse myself
In my very own private hell
Lately I'm beside myself
Pretending, unconcerned
Standing on a corner
Where I threw you on a turn
I'll move on. uh huh
Flowers on a cross remain
Mark an ending scene
Damn it all if blood you spill
Turn the grass more green
Life is short. uh huh I excuse myself
I'm used to my little cell
I amuse myself
In my very own private hell
Frozen in the place I hide
Not afraid to paint my sky with
Some who say I've lost my mind
Brother try and hope to find
You were always so far away
I know that pain so don't you run away
Like you used to do
Roses in a vase of white
Bloodied by the thorns beside the leaves
That fall because my hand is
Pulling them hard as I can
You were always so far away
I know that pain
So I won't run away like I used to do
Pictures in a box at home
Yellowing and green with mold
So I can barely see your face
Wonder how that color taste
You were always so far away
I know the way so don't you run away
Like you used to do
Come to me, I'll fill the hole
Why would I be lying
End fan, all planned out
Offering a wonderful
Peace of mind worth buying
Bow down last round up
I am wise and you don't know
A cloud is my home
Only some get in
Got an imaginary friend
Jesus don't like a queer
No problem with faith just fear
Promise those who've gone before
Waitin on you flyin
Leading, receiving us
I'm as flawed as any man
Look at me I'm smiling
Drink me, eat me up
I am wise and you don't know
A cloud is my home
Only some get in
Got an imaginary friend
Jesus don't like a queer
No problem with faith just fear
I am wise and you don't know
A cloud is my home
Only some get in
Got an imaginary friend
Jesus don't like a queer
The problem with faith
Fear
Liar 
Sure, God's all powerful, 
But does He have lips?
Whoa.
Dear
God, how have you been, then?
I'm not fine, fuck pretending
All of this death you're sending
Best throw some free heart mending
Invite you in my heart, then
When done, my sins forgiven?
This god of mine relaxes
World dies I still pay taxes
Can I be as my god am
Can you be as god am
Can I be as my god am
God of all my god am
So
Lord, I see you grinnin
Must be grand always winning
How proud are you being able
To gather faith from fable
Can I be as my god am
Can you be as god am
Can I be as my god am
God of all my god am
God am
My god am
God am
God
All this respect I'm giving
Shared strength acquired by livin
All bloomin life you're feeding
Can't hide sick ones you're weeding
Can I be as my god am
Can you be as god am
Can I be as my god am
God of all my god am
God am
God am
God am
You tried to kill me off
Surprised, I remain
A scale tips, impossible
Afraid of my own name
And I always paid attention to all the lines you crossed
Forgive this imperfection it shows, and know
I am the child that lives and cries in the corner
Dies in the corner
Unloved inside your mind
Intent obsolescence
Built into the system
Intent obsolescence
Built into the system
Intent obsolescence
Built into the system
Intent obsolescence
Built into the system
Intent obsolescence
Built into the system
Intent obsolescence
Built into the system I tried to shake it off
You can't remove this stain
A scale breaks, impossible
Afraid we are the same
And you never paid attention to all the lines I crossed
Forgive this imperfection it shows, and know
I am the child that lives and cries in the corner
Dies in the corner
Unloved inside your mind
Hides in a corner
Dies in a corner
Unloved inside your mind
Intent obsolescence
Built into the system
Intent obsolescence
Built into the system
Intent obsolescence
Built into the system
Intent obsolescence
Built into the system
Built into the system
In the darkest hole, you'd be well advised
Not to plan my funeral before the body dies, yeah
Come the morning light, it's a see through show
What you may have heard and what you think you know, yeah
Let the sun never blind your eyes
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind
Hear a sound from a voice inside
Sure to play a part, so you love the game
And in truth your lies become one and same, yeah
I could set you free, rather hear the sound
Of your body breaking as I take you down, yeah
Let the sun never blind your eyes
Let me sleep so my teeth don't grind
Hear a sound from a voice inside
In the darkest hole, you'd be well advised
Not to plan my funeral before the body dies, yeah
Let the sun never blind your eyes
Let me sleep so my teeth don't grind
Hear a sound from a voice inside
Love song take one I love you, I'm not coming back bitch I think I should say something I can't see, I can't feel anything, I can't I can't
Wash my face, cut out my teeth and tell me to grin
MY GUMS ARE BLEEDING! MY GUMS ARE BLEEDING! I hate you, I hate you
Get a fucking haircut!
Go fuck yourself
Rae
Dong
Chung 
Get something, get, get them, get them
Get them, get the fuckin midget
Get the midget 
Get the fuckin midget
Kiss the fuckin midget
Where the deer and antelope play.
Kiss the midget  
That was perfect, you guys, that was great!
When I awaken
And I'm achin
Time for sleepin, yeah
When I'm sayin
Time to go and
I've been hurtin, yeah
When I'm layin
I'm still trying
Concentrating on dyin, yeah
You're right as rain
But you're wrong to blame
Agreed my crime's the same
My sins I'll claim
Give you back shed pain
Go find a place for own shame
So you can deal
With this thing unreal
No one made you feel any hurt, yeah
Body's movin
Only provin
No one needed to move
Still believin
Yet mistaken
All
God's children, yeah
And I must say
I was stupid
Selfishly she consumed, yeah
And you must change
Patterns all we trained
Or never regain peace you seek
Now you hear me
For the things I see
Yeah, I believe in inner peace, yeah
Throw out
Blow up
Hold in
Show fine
No signs
Grow blind
No more time
Just one more time
So crazy, beat the strain
Too lazy, shake the gray
So, and she willed the rain
So let me be defamed
Your redundancy stains
Tired of infantile claims
Like puppets on their strings
Untangle you from me
Time to call the doggies off
Tired of the shadowin
Slide me to the side again
Slapped in the face again
No more time
Just one more time
Your redundancy stains
Tired of infantile claims
Live puppets on a string
Untangle you from me
One day my plane leaves
Some way my
Head
Creeps
Some day my head leads
Some way my
Head
Creeps
Empty room sets the scene
Pick at me slow, pain fiend
Suck me through barbed screen
Anger becomes our
Queen
Tounge whipping forked black
How long until you crack
Surprised and set back
Lackey's loose talk for fact
One day my plane leaves
Some day my
Head creeps
Some day my way leads
Some way my
Head creeps
So crazy feel the hate
Yeah, I got years to wait
I know it's not to late
Lending clean hands to fate
Rise from the dirt, I'm in
Hide in anothers skin
Stick black dress doll with pin
Your mouth takes on my grin
Run, run til you drop
Hide, everyone knows
We all trade in never-befores
Selling out for the score
Pray, squeal when you're caught
Cry, it's not my fault
Time to trade in never-befores
Selling out for the score
It seems you prophesized, all of this would end
Were you burned away when the sun rose again
Hate, long wearing thin
Negative, all you've been
Time to trade in never-befores
Selling out for the score
It seems you prophesized, all of this would end
Were you burned away when the sun rose again
Is she ready to know my frustration?
What she slippin inside, slow castration
I'm a riddle so strong, you can't break me
Did she come here to try, try to take me
Did she call my name?
I think it's gonna rain
When I die
Was it something I said, held against me?
Ain't no life on the run, slowly climbing
Caught in ice so she stares, stares at nothing
I can help her but won't, now she hates me
Did she call my name?
I think it's gonna rain
When I die
She won't let me hide
She don't want me to cry
Will she keep on the ground, trying to ground me
Slowly forgive my lie, lying to save me
Could she love me again, or will she hate me
Probably not, I know why, can't explain me
Did she call my name?
I think it's gonna rain
When I die
Just another lesson learned
Wear a scar, a bore repeating
Take a simple fateful turn
Opened up to stop the bleeding
Feeling like you never could
Been the disconnected frying
Hit the vein struck a nerve
Seeing through a self that's blinding
Nowhere to buy in
Most of us hiding
Others are shining
Just another bick you toss
Stone the number one deceiver
Multiply the added cost
Easy to become a believer
Feeling like you never could
Been the disconnected frying
Hit the vein struck a nerve
Seeing through a self that's blinding
Nowhere to buy in
Most of us hiding
Others are shining
You know when you find it
In your darkest hour you strike gold
A thought clicks, not the be-all end-all
You know when you find it
In your darkest hour you strike gold
A thought clicks, not the be-all end-all
Just another lesson learned.
You know when you find it
In your darkest hour you strike gold
A thought clicks, not the be-all end-all
You know when you find it
In your darkest hour you strike gold
A thought clicks, not the be-all end-all
Just another lesson learned.
Just another lesson learned.
Hope,
A new beginning
Time,
Time to start living
Like just before we died
There's no going back
To the place
We started from
Hurt,
Falling through fingers
Trust,
Trust in the feeling
There's something left inside
There's no going back
To the place
We started from
Ah
All secrets known.
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Calm,
All wounds are healing
Strong,
Truth is worth saving I want to feel alive
There's no going back
To the place
We started from
All secrets known
Ah
All secrets known

She'll leave me but she won't forget
And she wonders why she ain't right, she ain't right
Ain't right, she ain't right
Now we're as low as we can get
Can't leave and can't forget
We ain't right, we ain't right
Not right, we ain't right
Well it's hard to believe that somebody tricked you
when you can see you were only high
It's all up to you so you gamble
flat on your face and into the fire I was only 15, standout on the
Ave.
You're chasing a bad dream, a luxury I never had
Living my life in the box, or sleepin in the trash
Taking girls for the things I need, like booze, drugs and ass
Get stoned, daily survival in the war zone
Yeah our teens meant everything, alright
Half rack, smoking out till it's all black
Death trap, watch me going blind, oh
I don't care what you say, I
Or what you do
Chemical addiction is
Getting rid of you
So high, colors turn to sound
Goodbye, let us in and we'll lay you in the ground
Chosen on the floor, take another drag
Bought a bunch of valiums from skinny broadway bag
I don't know much about heroin but I, I wanna try
Just about everything once before I die
Get stoned, daily survival in the war zone
Yeah our teens meant everything, alright
Half rack, smoking out till it's all black
Death trap, watch me going blind, oh
I don't care what you say, I
Or what you do
Chemical addiction is
Getting rid of you
So high, colors turn to sound
Goodbye, let us in and we'll lay you in the ground
Now
Jerry do me like this.
Get stoned, daily survival in the war zone
Yeah our teens meant everything, alright
Half rack, smoking out till it's all black
Death trap, watch me going blind, oh
So young so brazen so unholy
I come to you in painted skies
Your broken saint, your ancient story
The living challenge to their lies
Trapped in the cold outside
There ain't no shelter
They wanna force my hand
Until I.
Take what I wanted and
Break all the lies that they
Feed, the fuckin liars
Smash all the temples and
Crawl through the rubble and
Cry to the fallen I'm the last of my kind still standing
I'm the last of my kind still standing down the law. A wolf alone upon the hillside
I live on what they throw away
I go to sleep behind the eight ball
I live to fight for one more day I'm trapped in the cold outside
There ain't no shelter
They wanna force my hand
Til I.
Take what I wanted and
Break all the lies that they
Feed, the fuckin liars
Smash all the temples and
Crawl through the rubble and
Cry to the fallen
Last of my kind still standing
Last of my kind still standing
Hung on a hook I'm a mirror
Cracked down the center I split you
Counting the clouds in a storm behind your eyes
Show you the face of a man who
Not that he wants but he has to
Look at the thing he's become, what I see
I'm caught in a still life with no frame
Sometimes people do, the world it don't change
Give up awaiting someday
Future between a gun and your head
Pieces of me on a tile floor
Look up at you as you change more
Floating in fear I appear a hundred times
Hold a reflection inside me
I cannot feel you are empty
Throw me away
I am broken not your time
I'm caught in a still life with no frame
Sometimes people do, the world it don't change
Give up awaiting someday
Future between a gun and your head
Not gonna save you
Perform euthanasia
Mending fence along the road
Barely holding together
Mapless zone the road signs holes
Keep ahead of the weather
Long past time to close dead eyes
Find a break in the highway
Out here I'm invisible
Very few going my way
Breath on a window showing tic tac toe
Rear view reflecting there ain't nobody home
Ghost town strip of misery
I ain't feeling no better
Road kill heart inside of me
Follow it to the letter
Sundown brings a welcome change
Everything that's hiding
More at home in landscapes strange
Are you selling I'm buying
Breath on a window showing tic tac toe
Rear view reflecting there ain't nobody home
Cigarette burn holes outline an old soul
Connect the dot scribbling
And you would never know
Failed to heed the signal
Thought you got through just in time
Crashing hard upon your ego
Penetrated from the side
I'd let you go, but you're always in the way
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday
I'd love to go, but you're always in the way
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday

Well, the nothin song sticks to your mouth
Like peanut butter on the brain
Nothin ever stays the same

Wearing cowhide steak on a skate
Back inside

I can't have you, I can't have you.
Nothings the same, need my fix of you
A crack in the mirror, pictures split in two
I can't believe you slipped away
I been drinking too much cause I'm trying to forget your face
And if I always try to do, all the things you want me to
I've been letting myself down to an early grave
And if I always try to do, all the things you want me to

Here I am again
I feel time is draggin on
Aren't you getting tired of me?
Whinging overdrawn
Faceless, blind
Want to take her out again
She's not just mine
Want to take her out again
In a bodiless embrace
Thriving I have grown
Fickle changing grip replaced
Choking take it all
Faceless, blind
Want to take her out again
She's not just mine
Want to take her out again
Dedicated, true to form
Still the only one
Only guarantee
Continue after I am done
Faceless, blind
Want to take her out again
She's not just mine
Want to take her out again
How the mind does shout for rest
When the body's shaken, yeah
Oh there's tightness in my chest
Still your leaves I'm raking
Oh
Lord is this a test?
Was it fun creating me?
My god's a little sick
Still he wants me gracious
Who
Are you
Who can see
It's ok to live through me
Live to be
Part of me
You're a week old magazine
Yeah
Was it something that I said?
Was it are they breaking me
I'm so selfish paying your rent
While your blood I'm taking
You
Bend me
Like a tree
Dirty dollar bills for leaves
Dark in a sea
Of my seeds
And the tears on which you feed
You feed
The body is a temple
A dormant alter
To where infantile men lie around
Itching and nibbling
Hoping for a small piece of sanity
That which you cannot give
Change!
Individuality
Buying pennies with my soul
And a little heaven spent
While the hell am I taking
Me
Parasite
Hide from life
You know they'll remember me
They all at war
In self-worth
All that matters much to me
Hey, let them do it again, yeah
Hey, you said you were my friend
Hey, turn me upside down,
Oh
Hey, feelin so down
Hey
You made a fool of me again
Again
Hey, I know I made the same mistake, yeah
I, I won't do it again, no
Why,
Why you slap me in the face, oww
I, I didn't say it was OK, no
No,
No.
You violate a part of me again
Again
Ah, ooo
Whoo whoo, yeah
Hey, you had time to think it out, yeah
Hey,
Your weak will won't help her heal her heart
Hey, I'll bet it really eats you up
Extending part of me again
Again
Ooo
Whoo whoo, yeah
Hot leather and sex
All the things that I dress in best
Ain't no way you can beat
The way I'm flyin fast on my feet

And I'm ready to roll

What does friend mean to you?
A word so wrongfully abused
Are you like me, confused
All included but you
Alone.
The sounds of silence often soothe
Shapes and colors shift with mood
Pupils widen and change their hue
Rapid brown avoid clear blue
Why's it have to be this way
Be this way.
Be this way.
Be this way.
Be this way.
Be this way.
Flowers watched through wide brown eyes
A child sings an unclaimed tune
Innocence spins cold cocoon
Grow to see the pain too soon
Why's it have to be this way
Be this way.
Be this way.
Be this way.
Be this way.
Be this way.
Be this way. At 7 am on a
Tuesday, usual
August .
Next week I'll be 28.
I'm still young, it'll be me.
Off the wall I scrape. you.
I can't wake, I gotta wake.
To cause this wake, I gotta wake no more.
It causes wake, to drown this hate.
To never really stay, never will.
You take your plate.
Put me through hell, live, live.
Direct your fate.
You say I can do it so well.
Your expiration date.
Your expiration date.
Fate, date, expiration date.
this was the last time
Hate.
And don't fuck with me again.
My own clean slate.
Don't fuck with me again.
Makes your eyes dilate.
Makes you shake.
Irate.

At the bottom of the hill

sexual chocolate baby
There's no time to give at all
I cause you grief and blow my hatred
Further in your mind
You reach, I run, you fall
On skinned knees you crawl 
CHORUS
I want to set you free, recognize my disease
Love, sex, pain, confusion, suffering
You're there crying, I feel not a thing
Drilling my way deeper in your head
Sinking, draining, drowning, bleeding, dead
So you sit and think of love
I wait, hate all the more, I fall
On skinned knees I crawl 
CHORUS
Now there's time to give it all
I put my fears behind again
On skinned knees we'll crawl 
CHORUS

Turn around you say
Scuse the tude but I haven't eaten today
And my eyes are turning grey
What's your name? I can't remember. I can't remember
Bring me down you try
Feel the pain and keep it all in till you die
Without eyes you cannot cry
Who's to blame?
I can't remember. I can't.
Remember identity, the visions in my mind from screamin at me
And mama, mama, ooh. my angry brains of infancy
Knocked down but I have enough hate
to breathe, down your throat and steal your energy
You took everything but my will to be
Now the loss of your god won't make me bleed
I am alive
Before you ask for something better
You should know I'm practiced at goodbyes
Are you so deprived
Think you're doing me a favor
I don't need no lesser savior
I'm doing fine
Fragile things so close together
Taped up broken from before
Part of something or all of nothing
A very long hard way to fall
Go then, if you don't feel right
Living in our home
Choking, eat your pride, eat your pride alone
Go then, if you don't feel right
Living in our home
Choking, eat your pride alone
Needless tension, the walls around you
Built before you came to tear them down
It was you I found
Take some time to think it over
If it's so hard to walk this road we mind
Then it's time to say goodbye
Fragile things so close together
Taped up broken from before
Part of something or all of nothing
A very long hard way to fall
Go then, if you don't feel right
Living in our home
Choking, eat your pride, eat your pride alone
Go then, if you don't feel right
Living in our home
Choking, eat your pride alone
So go then, if you don't feel right
Living in our home
Choking, eat your pride, eat your pride alone
If you don't feel right
Living in our home
Eat your pride alone

Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long long time ago
Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world I laughed and shis hand
And made my way back home

For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
At all the millions here
I must have died alone

In the pines, in the pines

One baby to another says I'm lucky to have met you
I don't care what you think unless it is about me
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you
With eyes so dilated I've become your pupil
You taught me everything without a poison apple
The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful, vacuum out the fluids
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
In a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours
I like you

Truth covered in security
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it couldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing
And I've got this friend, you see
Who makes me feel
And I wanted more
Than I could steal
I'll arrest myself
And wear a shield
I'll go out of my way
To prove I still
Smell her on you
Don't, tell me what I wanna hear
Afraid of never knowning fear
Experience anything you need I'll keep fighting jealousy
Until it's fucking gone

As my bones grew they did hurt

Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see them again till the fourth of
July
I knew a lady who came from
Duluth
She got bit by a dog with a rabid tooth
She went to her grave just a little too soon
And she flew away howling on the yellow moon
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go down to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see them again till the fourth of
July
Now the people cry and the people moan
And they look for a dry place to call their home
And try to find some place to rest their bones
While the angels and the devils try to make them their own
Where do bad folks go when they die?
They don't go to heaven where the angels fly
They go down to the lake of fire and fry
Won't see them again till the fourth of
July
If I had to lose a mile
If I had to touch feelings
I would lose my soul
The way I do I don't have to think
I only have to do it
The results are always perfect
And that's old news
Would you like to hear my voice
Sprinkled with emotion
Invented at your birth? I can't see the end of me
My whole expanse I cannot see
I formulate infinity
Stored deep inside me

It's so relieving
To know that you're leaving
As soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing
To hear that you're asking
Wherever you get your way
It's so soothing
To know that you'll sue me
This is starting to sound the same I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
In her false witness
We hope you're still with us
To see if they float or drown
Our favorite patient
A display of patience
Disease-covered
Puget

She'll come back as fire
To burn all the liars
And leave a blanket of ash on the ground I miss the comfort in being sad

I will never promise to
I will never follow you
I will never bother you
Never speak a word again
I will crawl away for good I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear

Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail

You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
I'm so warm and calm inside
I no longer have to hide
Let's talk about someone else
The steaming soup begins to melt
Nothing really bothers her
She just wants to love herself
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
I always knew to come like this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail

Something in the way, yeah
Mmm-mmm
Underneath the bridge
Tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped
Have all become my pets
And I'm living off of grass
And the drippings from the ceiling
It's okay to eat fish
Cause they don't have any feelings
Something in the way
Mmm-mmm
Something in the way, yeah

Mmm-mmm I'll start this off without any words
I got so high that I scratched till I bled I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
The finest day that I ever had
Was when I learned to cry on command I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
My brother died every night
It's safe to say, don't quote me on that I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
The black sheep got blackmailed again
Forgot to put on the zip code I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do? I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?
It is now time to make it unclear
To write off lines that don't make sense I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
And one more special message to go
And then I'm done, then I can go home I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do? I'm on my time with everyone
I have very bad posture
Sit and drink
Pennyroyal
Tea
Distill the life that's inside of me
Sit and drink
Pennyroyal
Tea
I'm anemic
Royalty
Give me a

Cherry
Flavored antacids

When I was an alien, cultures weren't opinions
Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm there
Gotta find a way, a better way, I'd better wait
Never met a wise man, if so it's a woman
Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm there

Many a hand has scaled the grand old face of the plateau
Some belong to strangers, and some to folks you know
Holy ghosts and talk show hosts are planted in the sand
To beautify the foothills, and shake the many hands
There's nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
And an illustrated book about birds
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
Who needs action when you got words
When you've finished with the mop then you can stop
And look at what you've done
The plateau's clean no dirt to be seen
And the work it was fun
There's nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop
And an illustrated book about birds
You see a lot up there but don't be scared
Who needs action when you got words
Well the many hands began to scan around for the next plateau
Some say it was in
Greenland, and some say
Mexico
Others decided it was nowhere except for where they stood
But those were all just guesses, wouldn't help you if they could

I could never promise you
It's some place I followed you
I will never wander through
This will mean I'll love again
Guess I'll never have a fan
This will mean me to me
I could never have a say
It's a never-ending dream
I will always want to flee
If I'm me you'll never know
Everything I ever know
Dream
It's another point of view
Look at me when I was you
I could never die again
I won't lose another friend
She will see another me
When I'm through it numbs me
Guess I'll know I'll medicate
Guess I'll fall and medicate
It's another opiate
But to me it's everything
Dream I will never promise you
Dream
Looking for a new kind of lover
Not a girl made of rubber
Someone who can make me feel how I wanna feel
And tell me all the things that I wanna hear
And make me lose control
And make me go insane
I want a girl that does cocaine
Cocaine, cocaine
Screwed up is how she needs to be
With no clue of reality
I just want you to make me feel how I wanna feel
And tell me all the things that I wanna hear
And make me lose control
And make me go insane
I want a girl that does cocaine
Cocaine
And now I'm washed up,
I've had my fun.
and I feel like the mud
It's that girl who can make me feel how I wanna feel
And tell me all the things that I wanna hear
And make me lose control
And make me go insane
You're that girl who does cocaine
She left me for a snowman named bob

Lost eyesight, I'm on your side

Please don't deceive me when I hurt you

Bell door on clanks, come on in
Floyd observes my hairy chin
Sit down chair don't be afraid
Steamed hot towel on my face I was shaved
I was shaved
I was shaved
Barney ties me to the chair
I can't see I'm really scared
Floyd breathes hard I hear a zip
Pee pee pressed against my lips I was shaved
I was shaved
I was shaved I sense others in the room
Opey,
Aunt
Bea, I presume
They take turns and cut me up
I died smothered in
Andy's clutch
I was shamed
I was shamed
I was shamed
Like most babies smell like butter
His smell smelled like no other
He was born scentless and senseless
He was born a scentless apprentice
Away
Go away, go away
Every wet nurse refused to feed him
Electrolytes smell like semen
I promise not to sell your perfumed secrets
There are countless formulas for pressing flowers
Away
Go away, go away
I lie in the soil and fertilize mushrooms
Leaking the gas we'll make into perfume
You can't fire me because I quit!
Throw me in the fire and I won't throw a fit
Hey, go away
Go away, go away
Go away, go away
Go away, go away
Mom and dad went to a show
They dropped me off at grandpa
Joe's
I kicked and screamed
Said Please, don't go!

Runny nose and runny yolk

You can cough on me again
I still havent had my full fill
In the someday what's that sound?

Broken heart and broken bones
Think about some capsules of horse pills
One more quirky cliched phrase
You're the one I wanna refill
In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound?
In the someday what's that sound? most people don't realize
that two large pieces of coral,
painted brown, and attached to his skull
with common wood screws can make a child look like a deer

You're always dancing down the street
With your suede blue eyes
And every new boy that you meet
He doesn't know the real surprise
Here she comes again
When she's dancing neath the starry sky
She'll make you flip

And she used to be mine
You've got your nuclear boots
And your drip dry glove
And when you bite your lip

Someday I'm gonna find a way, it's over
One more doubt here to claim my supper

Wondering how I'm gonna find a way, it's over

Breathe away here with you dream the same on the dew
Breathe the same on her breathe to moan on a man
Breathe and shame on you, he's late

Dead
Die!
Driven conversations, even I can read
Wouldn't want to fake it, and I'm tired of this dream 
Not sure about this sentence
Taking medications, in the back of the room
Driven conversations, he died in
June.
See the stab wounds in his hands
See him dying in his room
He's dying in his room
He's dying in his room
Heading for me, heading this way
He is coming, I don't care
Wouldn't want to fake it, well I don't mind
Giving conversations to a friend of mine
Giving medications, in a lighted room
Wouldn't want to fake it, I know I should
See the stab wounds in his hands
You killed him, I don't care
Keep a promise, you would too
Keep a promise, even you
See the silence in his head
He is coming, I don't care
We're not gonna make it, well I don't mind
Wouldn't want to fake it, but I have this time
Giving conversations, to whom they don't know
Taking medications till my stomach's full.
See a famine in his head
See him coming at their heels
He loves you, give him a chance
I don't love him, I don't care
See him starving, give her hell
It is over, we don't care
In
His
Room
Your life is shit, shit
Your life is bogus, bull
Your life is crime, crime
Your life is hell, hell I'm gonna die, start a new union
I'm gonna die, with my libido
I'm gonna die, start a new union
I'm gonna die, don't fuck with me
Your life is shit, shit
Your life is clean, its clean
Your life is lame, it's not so funny
Your life is stale, frail, frail I'm gonna die, start a new union

Your life is shit I'm gonna open up myself a flea market
I'm gonna open up myself a flea market
And you're gonna wish that you did
And retire on the profits
First off, I'm gonna empty out all of my
Mrs.
Butterworth jars
And I'm gonna put em on a shelf
With my 800 dollar a month tax free
Century21 shop
And then I am going to put my
Mrs.
Butterworth syrup jars on the shelf
Next to all the commemorative fast food chain glasses and cups
I've accumulated over the past 62 years
Then I'm going to get some plywood
I'm going to get some plywood
And cut them up into two by two feet squares
Then I'm going to get some burlap
And I'm going to cut them into two by two feet squares
And then I'm going to put them onto the pieces of plywood
And then I'm going to go to the beach
I'm going to go to the beach
And I'm gonna collect some shells and driftwood
And then I'm going to take the shells and driftwood
And glue them onto the plywood and burlap
And sell em for lots of money
People will be paying top dollar
For my kids new used new toys and clothing
Then maybe someday I can get rid of that piss-stained mattress
I've been sleeping on I'm gonna die, start a new union
I'm gonna hell on my libido
I'm gonna die, start a new union
I'm gonna die on my libido I'm gonna die, start a new union
I'm gonna die on my libido
I'm gonna die, start a new union
I'm gonna die, watch the pain
When I feel tired
She pushed food through the door
And I crawl towards the crack of light
Sometimes I can't find my way
Newspapers spread around soaking all that they can
A cleaning is due again, a good hosing down
The lady who I feel maternal love for
Cannot look me in the eyes
But I see hers and they are blue
And they cock and twist and masturbate I said so
I said so
I said so

Black windows of paint I scratched with my nails
I see others just like me, why do they not try to escape?
They bring out the older ones, they point in my way
They come with a flash of light and take my family away
And very later I have learned to
Accept some friends or ridicule
My whole existence is for your amusement
And that is why I'm here with you
To take
Me with
You're right

This song is for the lovers out there
And all the lights on the trees
All the flowers have gingivitis
And the birds fly happily
We'll be together once again my love
I need you back, oh baby baby I can't explain just why we lost it from the start
Living without you girl, you only break my heart .
Yeah! I can feel it, I can hold it, I can pin it, shape it, mold it,
I can cut it, I can taste it, spank it
Beat it while you .
Ah, wait here I've been looking for days now
Always hearing the same ol

Contradictonary lies
I'll take pride as the king of illiterature
I'm very ape
And very nice
If you ever need anything
Please don't
Hesitate to ask someone else first
I'm to busy acting like I'm not naive
I've seen it all

Out of the ground
Into the sky

They lead a lifetime that is comfortable.
They travel far to keep their stomachs full.
They make their living off of arts and crafts.
The kind with seashells, driftwood, and burlap.
They make a deal when they come to town.
The
Sunday swap meet is a battleground.
She loves him more than he will ever know.
He loves her more than he will ever show.
Keeps his cigarettes close to his heart.
Keeps her photographs close to her heart.
Keeps the bitterness close to the heart.

Could've had a heart attack, my heart
We don't know anything, my heart
We all want something fair, my heart
Hey!
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!
Out of town, out of sight, is my heart
Queen of lies, today, my heart
One more on the phone, my heart
One more at the door of my heart
Hey!
Hey, hey!
Mean heart, cold heart
Cold heart, cold heart
Cold heart, cold heart
Cold heart, cold heart
Hey! I don't need to love again
I won't sigh and mope again
I don't need to love again
I just don't think it's worth it
I don't really love her
I don't think I want her
Ain't gonna take to love again
It's the way your love hurts
It's the way your mad again
I don't think I'll love again
I won't ever promise her
I don't think I want her
This time no one else

I don't ever promise you
Sometimes I don't love you
Think I'm tired of loving her
I don't really want love
Hey, hey, hey, hey
You know you're right
You told me to follow him
Teach him that I loved him
I won't ever promise you
I won't even bother to
You gave me my first kiss
I don't think I want it now
I don't ever want again
It's all that I had to have
It's all that I wanted
It's all that I had to
I don't think I'll miss her
I don't think I want her

And if I might
Lie me down
Weeping
And if I say
What it's like
I might be
Dreaming
If I may
What is right
Some make time
To see me heal
Those years in his bonet
A phrase from his pocket
And chains of a knowing
life long dream
Dream
Do re mi
If I may
And if I might
Wake me up
And see me
And if I do
And if I lie
Find me out
At sea
And if I may
Cold as ice
I might have to
See me
Dream
The rays in his socket
A phrase from this moment
The chase on his socket I will need
Dream
Do re mi
Wish me good
Wish made light
Find me out
At sea
He's under a wave
Just be quiet
Follow pain
And grieving
Yell oh well
and if I sigh
Seek me out
teeming
If I may
If I might
Golden gun
To bleed
And praise in his pocket
Rays from his women
Chains from his knowing
life long dream
Do re mi
Dream

He's not the greatest man the world has known

Don't make me pitiful
And in the morning light
We're just the same you and me
Out on the go, send officials
Our propensity to breed
The higher, the farther, the faster you fly
You may be rich, but you can't deny me
Got nothing, got nothing but the will to survive
You can't control, and you can't deny me
Your lies are sick
They're sick and they're vile
You can't deny me
Try and talk down to me
My mind it ain't so simple
Where's your vocabulary
Your ignorance is sinful
You plant your lying seeds
Watch as the roots take hold
The country you are now poisoning
Condition critical
The higher, the farther, the faster you fly
I know it's true, and you can't deny me
Got nothing, got nothing, you got nothing to hide
Little bullshit whore, and you can't deny me
The higher, the farther, the faster you fly
It's all so sick, and you can't deny me
You can't deny me
You can't deny me
You don't defy me
You can't deny me
The higher, the farther, the faster you fly
You know you're sick, and you can't deny me
Got nothing, just nothing, got something to hide
We see right through you, and you can't deny me
Darkness, darkness, darkness and light
You can't deny me
Oh where oh where, can my baby be?
The
Lord took her away from me.
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good.
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.
We were out on a date in my daddy's car.
We hadn't driven very far.
There in the road, straight ahead.
A car was stalled, the engine was dead. I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right.
I'll never forget the sound that night.
The screaming tires, the busting glass.
The painful scream that I heard last.
Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?
The
Lord took her away from me.
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good.
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.
When I woke up the rain was pouring down.
There were people standing all around.
Something warm pooling through my eyes.
But somehow I found my baby that night.
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said.
Hold me darling, just a little while.
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss.
I found the love that I knew I would miss.
Well now she's gone, even though I hold her tight.
I lost my love, my life, that night.
Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?
The
Lord took her away from me.
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good.
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.
Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?
The
Lord took her away from me.
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good.
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.
Yes, I understand that every life must end, uh-huh
As we sit alone, I know someday we must go, uh-huh
Oh I'm a lucky man, to count on both hands the ones I love
Some folks just have one, yeah, others, they've got none, uh-huh
Stay with me.
Let's just breathe.
Practiced are my sins, never gonna let me win, uh-huh
Under everything, just another human being, uh-huh
I don't wanna hurt, there's so much in this world to make me bleed
Stay with me
You're all I see.
Did I say that I need you?
Did I say that I want you?
Oh, if I didn't I'm a fool you see
No one knows this more than me
As I come clean.
I wonder everyday, as I look upon your face, uh-huh
Everything you gave
And nothing you would take, oh no
Nothing you would take
Everything you gave.
Did I say that I need you?
Oh, did I say that I want you?
Oh, if I didn't I'm a fool you see
No one knows this more than me
And I come clean, ah.
Nothing you would take
Everything you gave
Hold me til I die
Meet you on the other side.
Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay
Were laid spread out before me, as her body once did
All all five horizons, revolved around her soul.
As the
Earth to the
Sun
Now, the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn
Ooh, and all I taught her was. everything
Ooh, I know she gave me all. that she wore
And now my bitter hands, chafe beneath the clouds of what was everything
All the pictures have all been washed in black
Tattooed everything I take a walk outside
I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear?
Mmm, and twisted thoughts that spin around my head
I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning
How quick the
Sun can drop away
And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass. of what was everything
All the pictures have, all been washed in black
Tattooed everything
All the love gone bad, turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all that I'll be, yeah I know that someday you'll have a beautiful life, I know you'll be a star
In somebody else's sky.
But why, why, why can't it be. can't it be mine?
Ah, yeah
Unsealed, on a porch a letter sat
Then you said, I wanna leave it again
Once I saw her on a beach of weathered sand
And on the sand I wanna leave her again
On a weekend I wanna wish it all away, yeah
And they called and I said that I'll go
And I said that I'll call out again
And the reason I ought ta leave her calm, I know
I said, I don't know whether I'm the boxer or the bag
Oh yeah, can you see them, out on the porch?
Yeah, but they don't wave
I see them round the front way, yeah
And I know, and I know I don't wanna stay
Make me cry I see oh, I don't know why there's something else
I want to, wanna drum it all away
I said, I don't, I don't know whether I was the boxer or the bag
Oh yeah, can you see them, out the on porch?
Yeah, but they don't wave
I see them round the front way
And I know, and I know I don't want to stay at all
I don't want to stay
I don't want to stay
I don't want to stay
I don't, I don't want to stay
At home, drawing pictures of mountain tops
With him on top
Lemon yellow sun, arms raised in a V
And the dead lay in pools of maroon below
Daddy didn't give attention
Oh, to the fact that mommy didn't care
King
Jeremy the wicked
Oh, ruled his world
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Clearly I remember pickin on the boy
Seemed a harmless little fuck
Ooo, but we unleashed a lion
Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast
How could I forget?
And he hit me with a surprise left
My jaw left hurtin, ooo, dropped wide open
Just like the day, oh, like the day I heard
Daddy didn't give affection, no
And the boy was something that mommy wouldn't wear
King
Jeremy the wicked
Oh, ruled his world
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Try to forget this
Try to erase this, from the blackboard
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in class today
Jeremy spoke in, spoke in
Jeremy spoke in, spoke in
Jeremy spoke in class today
Freezin, rests his head on a pillow made of concrete again
Oh, feelin maybe he'll see a little better set a days, oh yeah
Oh, hand out faces that he sees time again ain't that familiar, ah
Oh, dark grin he can't help when he's happy he looks insane, hey
Evenflow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away, oh
Oh, someday yeah, he'll begin his life again
Life again, life again
Kneelin, lookin through the paper though he doesn't know to read, oh yeah
Oh, prayin now to something that has never showed him anything
Oh, feelin understands the weather of the winters on its way, yeah
Oh, ceilings few and far between all the legal halls of shame, hey
Evenflow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away
Ah, someday, yeah, he'll begin his life again, yeah
Oh, whisperin hands gently lead him away

Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away, yeah
Ah someday yeah, he'll begin his life again,

Oh, whisperin hands gently lead him away
Him away, him away
Yeah
Waitin, watchin the clock
It's four o clock, it's got to stop
Tell him, take no more. she practices her speech
As he opens the door, she rolls over
Pretends to sleep as he looks her over
She lies and says she's in love with him, can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red, can't find a better man
Can't find a better man, can't find a better man
Oh
Talkin to herself, there's no one else who needs to know
She tells herself, oh
Memories back when she was bold and strong, and waiting for the world to come along
Swears she knew it, now she swears he's gone
She lies and says she's in love with him, can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red, can't find a better man
She lies and says she still loves him, can't find a better man
She dreams in color, she dreams in red, can't find a better man
Can't find a better man, can't find a better man
Yeah
She loved him, yeah, she don't want to leave this way
She feeds him, yeah, that's why she'll be back again
Can't find a better man, can't find a better man, can't find a better man, can't find a better man
Son, she said, have I got a little story for you
What you thought was your daddy was nothin but a
While you were sittin home alone at age thirteen
Your real daddy was dyin
Sorry you didn't see him
But I'm glad we talked
Oh, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, oh
Oh, she walks slowly, across a young man's room
She said I'm ready for you I can't remember anything to this very day
Cept the look, the look
Oh, you know where
Now, I can't see, I just stare I, I'm still alive
Hey, I, but, I'm still alive
Hey, I, boy, I'm still alive
Hey, I, I, I'm still alive, yeah
Ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh
Is something wrong? she said
Well, of course, there is
You're still alive, she said
Oh, and do I deserve to be?
Is that the question?
And if so, if so, who answers? who answers?
I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, oh, I'm still alive
Hey, I, but, I'm still alive
Yeah, I, oh, I'm still alive
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?
The
Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world
We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The screamin tires, the bustin glass
The painful scream that I heard last
Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?
The
Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world
When I woke up the rain was pourin down
There were people standin all around
Something warm flowing through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
Hold me darling, just a little while
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I had missed
Well now she's gone even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life, that night
Oh where, oh where, can my baby be?
The
Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I've got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world I see the world, feel the chill
Which way to go, windowsill
I see the world's on a rocking horse of time
I see the birds in the rain
Oh, dear dad, can you see me now
I am myself, like you somehow
I'll ride the wave where it takes me
I'll hold the pain release me
Oh, dear dad, can you see this now
I am myself, like you somehow
I'll wait up in the dark for you to speak to me
I'll open up release me, release me, release me, release me i got a car, i got some gas
Oh let's get out of here
Get out of here fast
Ooh everyone's confused
So i stay in my room
If i go, i don't want
To go alone I hope you get this message
Oh you're not home
I could be there in
Ten minutes or so
Ooh i got my things
We'll make it up as we go along
Oh with you i could
Never be alone
Never be alone I seem to recognize your face
Haunting, familiar yet, I can't seem to place it
Cannot find the candle of thought to light your name
Lifetimes are catching up with me
All these changes taking place
I wish I'd seen the place
But no one's ever taken me
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
I swear, I recognize your breath
Memories like fingerprints are slowly raising
Me, you wouldn't recall for I'm not my former
It's hard when you're stuck upon the shelf
I changed by not changing at all
Small town predicts my fate
Perhaps that's what no one wants to see
I just want to scream hello
My
God it's been so long
Never dreamed you'd return
But now here you are and here I am
Hearts and thoughts they fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
Hearts and thoughts they fade.
Alone, listless
Breakfast table in an otherwise empty room
Young girl, violins
Center of her own attention
The mother reads aloud
child tries to understand it
tries to make her proud
The shades go down
it's in her head, painted room.
can't deny there's something wrong
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
the picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
the picture kept will remind me
Don't call me.
She holds the hand that holds her down
She will rise above.
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
the picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to me
the picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to
the picture kept will remind me
Don't call me daughter, not fit to me
the picture kept will remind me
Don't call me.
The shades go down
The shades go down
The shades go.
Go.
Go.
The waiting drove me mad
You're finally here and I'm a mess
I take your entrance back
Can't let you roam inside my head
I don't want to take what you can give
I would rather starve than eat your bread
I would rather run but I can't walk
Guess I'll lie alone just like before I'll take the varmint's path
Oh, and I must refuse your test
Push me and I will resist
This behavior's not unique I don't want to hear from those who know
They can buy, but can't put on my clothes
I don't want to limp for them to walk
Never would have known of me before
I don't want to be held in your debt
I'll pay it off in blood, let I be wed
I'm already cut up and half-dead
I'll end up alone like I began
Everything has chains
Absolutely nothing's changed
Take my hand, not my picture, spilled my tincture. I don't want to take what you can give
I would rather starve than eat your breast
All the things that others want for me
Can't buy what I want because it's free
Can't buy what I want because it's free
Can't be what you want because I'm.
Ain't supposed to be just one
Oh, to live and die, let it be done
I figure I'll be damned, all alone like I began
It's your move now
I thought you were a friend
But I guess I. I guess I hate you.
He could've tuned in, tuned in. but he tuned out
A bad time, nothing could save him
Alone in a corridor waiting, locked out
He got up outta there, ran for hundreds of miles
He made it to the ocean, had a smoke in a tree
The wind rose up, set him down on his knee
A wave came crashing like a fist to the jaw
Delivered him wings.
Hey, look at him now!
Arms wide open with the sea as his floor
Oh, power, oh
He's flying whole
High, wide, oh
He floated back down cause he wanted to share.
His key to the locks on the chains he saw everywhere
But first he was stripped, and then he was stabbed.
By faceless men, well, fuckers, he still stands
And he still gives his love, he just gives it away
The love he receives is the love that is saved
And sometimes is seen a strange spot in the sky
A human being that was given to fly
High. flying, oh
High. flying, oh
He's. flying, oh
Oh, oh
If I ever were to lose you
I'd surely lose myself
Everything I have found, dear
I've not found by myself
Try and sometimes you'll succeed
To make this man of me
All my stolen missing parts
I've no need for anymore I believe
And I believe cause I can see
Our future days
Days of you and me
Back when I was feeling broken
I focused on a prayer
You came deep as any ocean
Did something out there hear?
All the complexities and games
No one wins but somehow they're still played
All the missing crooked hearts
They may die but in us they live on I believe
And I believe cause I can see
Our future days
Days of you and me
When hurricanes and cyclones raged
When wind turned dirt to dust
When floods they came or tides they raised
Ever closer became us
All the promises at sundown
I've meant them like the rest
All the demons used to come round
I'm grateful now they've left
So persistent in my ways
Hey angel, I am here to stay
No resistance, no alarms
Please, this is just too good to be gone I believe
And I believe cause I can see
Our future days
Days of you and me
You and me
Days
You and me
State of love and trust as I
Busted down the pretext
Sin still plays and preaches,
But to have an empty court, uh huh
And the signs are passin,
Grip the wheel, can't read it
Sacrifice receiving
The smell that's on my hands, hands, yeah!
And I listen
For the voice inside my head
Nothin, I'll do this one myself
Lay her down as priest does,
Should the
Lord be accountin
Will be in my honor,
Make it pain, painfully quick, uh huh
Promises are whispered
In the age of darkness
Want to be enlightened
Like I want to be told the end, end, yeah!
And the barrel shakes aimed
A directly at my head
Oh, help me, help me from myself
And I listen
From both sides of a friend
Nothin, I'll do this one myself
Myself, myself!
Yeah, yeah!
Solo:
Guitar
Hey, na na na na!
Hey that's something!
Wanna back, back it away, yeah!
And I listen, oh!
For the voice inside my head
Nothin, I'll do this one myself
Oh, ah, and the barrel waits,
Trigger shakes
Aimed right at my head,
Don't won't you help me?
Help me from myself!
State of love and trust, and a
State of love and. yeah, yeah!
Hear the sirens
Hear the sirens
Hear the sirens
Hear the circus so profound
I hear the sirens
More and more in this here town
Let me catch my breath to breathe
And reach across the bed
Just to know we're safe
I am a grateful man
The slightest bit of light
And I can see you clear
Have to take your hand
And feel your breath
For fear this someday will be over
I pull you close, so much to lose
Knowing that nothing lasts forever
I didn't care, before you were here
I danced in laughter with the ever after
But all things change
Let this remain
Hear the sirens
Covering distance in the night
The sound echoing closer
Will they come for me next time?
For every choice mistake I've made
It's not my plan
Or to send you in the arms of
Another man
And if you choose to stay I'll wait
I'll understand
It's a fragile thing
This life we lead
If I think too much I can get
Over
Whelmed by the grace
By which we live our lives
With death over our shoulders
Want you to know
That should I go I always loved you
Held you high above, true
I study your face
And the fear goes away
It's a fragile thing
This life we lead
If I think too much I can get over
Whelmed by the grace
By which we live our lives
With death over our shoulder
Want you to know
That should I go I always loved you
Held you high above, true
I study your face
And the fear goes away
The fear goes away
The fear goes away
Aah ah, oh oh
Aah ah, oh oh
Hold on to the thread
The currents will shift
Glide me towards
You know something's left
And we're all allowed
To dream of the next
Oh, oh the next, time we touch
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
You don't have to stray
Tho oceans away
Waves roll in my thoughts
Hold tight the ring
The sea will rise
Please stand by the shore
Oh, oh, oh, I will be
I will be there once more
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Uh huh, uh huh
Once divided, nothing left to subtract
Some words when spoken, can't be taken back
Walks on his own, with thoughts he can't help thinking
Future's above, but in the past he's slow and sinking
Caught a bolt a lightnin. cursed the day he let it go
Nothingman,
Nothingman
Isn't it something,
Nothingman
She once believed. in every story he had to tell
One day she stiffened, took the other side
Empty stares. from each corner of a shared prison cell
One just escapes. one's left inside the well
And he who forgets, will be destined to remember
Nothingman,
Nothingman
Isn't it something,
Nothingman
Oh, she don't want him
Oh, she won't feed him.
After he's flown away
Oh, into the sun, yeah, into the sun
Burn, burn
Nothingman,
Nothingman
Isn't it something,
Nothingman
Nothingman,
Nothingman
Coulda been something,
Nothingman
If I keep holding out will the light shine through?
Under this broken roof, it's only rain that I feel
I've been wishing out the days. come back I have been planning out all that I'd say to you
Since you slipped away.
Know that I still remain true
I've been wishing out the days.
Please say, that if you hadn't of gone now
I wouldn't have lost you another way
From wherever you are. come back
And these days, they linger on
And in the night I've been waiting for
The real possibility I may meet you in my dream
I go to sleep
If I don't fall apart will my memories stay clear
So you had to go and I had to remain here
But the strangest thing to date
So far away
And yet you feel so close
And I'm not gonna question it any other way
There must be an open door
For you to come back
And the days, they linger on
And every night, what I'm waiting for
Is the real possibility I may meet you in my dreams
And sometimes you're here and you're talking back to me
Come the morning I could swear you're next to me
And it's okay.
It's okay
It's okay
I'll be here
Come back
Come back
I'll be here
Come back
Come back
I'll be here
Come back
Come back I wish I was a neutron bomb
For once I could go off
I wish I was a sacrifice
But somehow still lived on I wish I was a sentimental
Ornament you hung on
The
Christmas tree, I wish I was
The star that went on top I wish I was the evidence
I wish I was the grounds
For fifty million hands up raised
And opened toward the sky I wish I was a sailor with
Someone who waited for me
I wish I was as fortunate
As fortunate as me I wish I was a messenger
And all the news was good
I wish I was the full moon shining
Off a
Camaro's hood I wish I was an alien
At home behind the sun
I wish I was the souvenir
You kept your house key on I wish I was the pedal break
That you depended on
I wish I was the verb to trust
And never let you down I wish I was the radio song
The one that you turned up
I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
I guess it never stops
The selfish, they're all standing in line
Faithing and hoping to buy themselves time
Me, I figure as each breath goes by I only own my mind
The north is to south what the clock is to time
There's east and there's west and there's everywhere life
I know I was born and I know that I'll die
The in-between is mine I am mine
And the feeling, it gets left behind
All the innocence lost at one time
Significant behind the eyes
There's no need to hide
We're safe tonight
The ocean is full cause everyone's crying
The full moon is looking for friends at high tide
The sorrow grows bigger when the sorrow's denied
I only know my mind I am mine
And the meaning, it gets left behind
All the innocence lost at one time
Significant behind the eyes
There's no need to hide
We're safe tonight, whoa
And the feelings that get left behind
All the innocence broken with lies
Significance between the lines
We may need to hide
And the meanings that get left behind
All the innocence lost at one time
We're all different behind the eyes
There's no need to hide
Well I don't mind stealing bread
From the mouths of decadents
But I can't feed on the powerless
When my cup's already overfilled
Yeah
But it's on the table
The fire's cooking
And they're farming babies
The slaves are all working
Blood is on the table
The mouths are all choking
But I'm goin hungry
Yeah I don't mind stealing bread
From the mouths of decadents
But I can't feed on the powerless
When my cup's already overfilled
But it's on the table
The fire is cooking
And they're farming babies
The slaves are all working
And it's on the table
Their mouths are all choking
But I'm going hungry 
Going hungry
I'm going hungry 
Going hungry
I'm going hungry 
Going hungry
One.
Two.
One.
Two
Know a man
His face seemed pulled and tense
Like he's riding on a motorbike
So I approach with tact
Suggest that he should relax
But he's always moving much too fast
On this trip he's taken for a ride
He's been takin too much on
There he goes with his perfectly unkept clothes
There he goes
He's yet to come back
But I've seen his picture
We go way back
I wonder bout his insides
It's like his thoughts are too big for his size
He's been taken. where, I don't know
Off he goes with his perfectly unkept hope
There he goes
And now I rub my eyes, for he has returned
It seems my preconceptions are what should have been burned
For he still smiles.
And he's still strong
That has grown
And now he's home and we're laughin
Like we always did, my same old, same old friend
Until a quarter to ten
He seems distracted and I know just what is going to happen next
Before his first step,
He's off again
What the fuck is this world?
Running to, you didn't
Leave a message, at least I
Could have heard your voice one last time
Daily minefield, this could
Be my time by you
Would you hit me?
Would you hit me?
Oh
Oh, ow
All the bills go by, and
Initiatives are taken up
By the middle
There ain't gonna be any middle any more
And the cross I'm bearing home
Ain't indicative of my place
Left the porch
Left the porch, oh, oh
Hear my name
Take a good look
This could be the day
Hold my hand
Walk beside me
I just need to say
Hear my name
Take a good look
This could be the day
Hold my hand
Lie beside me
I just need to say
I could not take
Uh, just one day
I know that I would not ever touch you,
Hold you, feel you in my arms ever again
Hey
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah I know about a man to whom I may be related, he's leatherman.
Died a long time ago in the 1880's. leatherman, leatherman.
Covered with leather, but it wasn't tight.
Underneath the moon in the woods at night.
Makin the rounds ten miles a day,
Once a month they'd spot him, here's what they'd say.
Here he comes, he's a man of the land.
He's leatherman.
Smile on his face, an axe in his pack.
He's leatherman.
Comes out of the caves once a day to be fed.
Wasn't known to say but Thanks for the bread.
So modern day I walk my way, my jacket faded,
Just like a man of leather whom I may be related.
Rolled a cigarette, but when he asked for a light,
I thought he'd be an animal, but so polite.
Makin the rounds ten miles a day.
Once a month they'd spot him and here's what they'd say.
Here he comes, he's a man of the land, he's leatherman.
Smile on his face, an axe in his hand.
He's leatherman.
Shake his hand he's leatherman.
Bake some bread he's leatherman.
Shame he's dead. I saw his bed,
It's all that's left of leatherman.
Give me some skin, leatherman.
Vacate is the word.
vengeance has no place on me or her
Cannot find the comfort in this world
Artificial tear.
vessel stabbed, next up, volunteers
Vulnerable, wisdom can't adhere. A truant finds home. and a wish to hold on.
But there's a trapdoor in the sun.
Immortality.
As privileged as a whore.
victims in demand for public show
Swept out through the cracks beneath the door
Holier than thou, how?
Surrendered. executed, anyhow
Scrawl dissolved, cigar box on the floor. A truant finds home. and a wish to hold on too.
He saw the trapdoor in the sun. I cannot stop the thought. I'm running in the dark.
Coming up a which way sign.
all good truants must decide.
Oh, stripped and sold, mom.
Auctioned forearm.
And whiskers in the sink.
Truants move on. cannot stay long
Some die just to live.
Ohh.
She don't wander in
Don't wander in here, she
She don't wander in here
Don't wander in here
The direction of the eye, so misleading
The defection of the soul, nauseously quick
I don't question our existence
I just question our modern needs
She don't wander in
Don't wander in here, she
She don't wander in here I will walk with my hands bound
I will walk with my face blood
I will walk with my shadow flag
Into your garden, garden of stone, yeah
After all is done and we're still alone
I won't be taken
Yet I'll go with my hands bound
I will walk with my face blood
I will walk with my shadow flag
Into your garden, garden of stone I don't show, I don't share
I don't need, yeah
What you have to give, yeah
Ooo, I will walk with my hands bound
I will walk with my face blood
I will walk with my shadow flag
Into your garden, garden oh
I will walk with my hands bound
I will walk into your garden, garden of stone
I don't know, I don't care
I don't need you for me to live I will light the match this mornin
So I won't be alone
Watch as she lies silent
For soon night will be gone
Oh, I will stand arms outstretched
Pretend I'm free to roam
I will make my way
Through, one more day in hell
How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make? I will hold the candle
Til it burns up my arm
Oh, I'll keep takin punches
Until their will grows tired
Oh, I will stare the sun down
Until my eyes go blind
Hey, I won't change direction
And I won't change my mind
How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make? I'll swallow poison
Until I grow immune
I will scream my lungs out
Till it fills this room
How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make?
How much difference does it make? I took a drive today
Time to emancipate
I guess it was the beatings, made me wise
But I'm not about to give thanks or apologize I couldn't breathe, holdin me down
Hand on my face, pushed to the ground
Enmity gaged, united by fear
Forced to endure what I could not forgive I seem to look away
Wounds in the mirror waved
It wasn't my surface
Most defiled
Head at your feet, fool to your crown
Fist on my plate, swallowed it down
Enmity gaged, united by fear
Tried to endure what I could not forgive
Saw things, saw things
Saw things, saw things
Clearer, clearer
Once you, were in my rear view mirror I gather speed from you fucking with me
Once and for all, I'm far away
I hardly believe, finally the shades
Are raised, hey
Saw things so much clearer
Once you, once you
Rear view mirror
Saw things so much clearer
Once you, once you
Rear view mirror
Saw things so much clearer
Once you, once you
Rear view mirror
Saw things so much clearer
Once you
Oh yeah
Tidal waves don't beg forgiveness
Crashed and on their way
Father he enjoyed collisions; others walked away
A snowflake falls in may.
And the doors are open now as the bells are ringing out
Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow
Goodbye for now.
Nature has its own religion; gospel from the land
Father ruled by long division, young men they pretend
Old men comprehend.
And the sky breaks at dawn; shedding light upon this town
They'll all come round
Cause the man of the hour is taking his final bow
G bye for now.
And the road
The old man paved
The broken seams along the way
The rusted signs, left just for me
He was guiding me, love, his own way
Now the man of the hour is taking his final bow
As the curtain comes down
I feel that this is just good bye for now.
Oh tonight began with anything
Shaft of a light, a warm breath and a scream, ah yeah.
Oh, tamper if you like between the doors, oh yeah. huh. huh.
Oh, can't expect to go out. to go out.
With anything. anything more.
Oh reach the door. a breath and a.
Oh reach the door
And a la la la la yeah
Life ain't what it's worth. a breath and a.
Oh reach the door
All these reaching hands out grabbin things, grabbin me
Day in, day out, accumulating, ah yeah
Oh, I suggest you step out on your porch
Oh yeah, huh, huh, huh, huh, yeah.
Run away my son, to see it all. oh, see the world
Oh reach the door. a breath and a.
Oh reach the door
And a la la la la yeah
Life ain't what it's worth. a breath and a.
Oh reach the door
Come. here it comes.
There it goes. when it comes
Where it goes. where it comes.
Can't see through the faith. whoa
Ooh, come. here it comes.
There it goes, grasp what you can
Don't you know there's something inside your head, yeah.
Oh, if I knew where it was I would take you there
There's much more than this, ooh.
Much more than this
Oh, see the world. much more than, oh.
Much more than.
Why?
My lips are shakin my nails are bit off
Been a month since I've even heard myself talk
Only advantage this life's got on me
Picture empty cup in the middle of the sea
And I fought back in my mind
Never lets me be right, I got memories, I got shit
So much it don't show
Oh, I walked the line, when you held me in at night
Oh, I walked the line, when you held my hand at night
An empty shells seem so easy to crack
Got all these questions
Don't know who I could even ask
So I'll just lie alone, and wait for the dream
Where I'm not ugly and you're lookin at me
And I'll stay in a bed
Oh, blues eyes, I've seen him
If just once I could feel loved
Oh, stare back at me
But I walked the line
When you held me in at night
Oh, I walked the line
When you held my hand at night
Oh, I walked the line
When you held me close at night
I paid the price
Never held you in real life
My lips are shakin.
Lives opened and trashed,
Look,
Ma, watch me crash,
No time to question.
Why'd nothing last?
Grasp and hold on,
We're dying fast.
Soon be over and I will relent.
Let the ocean swell, dissolve way my past.
Three days and maybe longer,
Won't even know I've left.
Under your tongue, I'm like a tab,
I will give you what you're not supposed to have.
Under my breath, I swear by sin, for better or worse,
A best we began.
Let the sun climb, oh, burn way my mask.
Three days and maybe longer.
Shed my skin at last. shed. shed
Let the sun shine, burn way my mask.
Three days and maybe longer,
Won't ever find me here
Let the ocean dissolve way my past.
Four days and not much longer.
Let my spirit pass.
This is, this is.
This is, this is.
This is, this is.
This is, this is. my last exit
Restless soul, enjoy your youth
Like
Muhammad hits the truth
Can't escape from the common rule
If you hate something, don't you do it, too
Small my table, sits just two
Got so crowded, I can't make room
Oh, where did they come from?
Stormed my room!
And you dare say it belongs to you. to you
This is not for you
This is not for you
This is not for you
Oh, not for you. ah, you
Scream. my friends. don't call me
Friends, no, they don't scream
My friends don't call. my friends don't.
All that's sacred comes from youth
Dedication, naive and true
With no power, nothing to do
I still remember, why don't you?
Don't you
This is not for you
This is not for you
This is not for you
Oh, never was for you, fuck you
This is not for you
Oh, this is not for you. yeah, you
This is not for you
Oh, not for you
Oh, you
And now you want me to breathe
And be so grateful
Ahhhhh, for the air that I need 
haha
Don't make me pitiful
And in the morning light
We're just the same you and me
Out on the go, send officials
Our propensity to breed
The higher, the farther, the faster you fly
You may be rich, but you can't deny me
Got nothing, got nothing but the will to survive
You can't control, and you can't deny me
Your lies are sick
They're sick and they're vile
You can't deny me
Try and talk down to me
My mind it ain't so simple
Where's your vocabulary
Your ignorance is sinful
You plant your lying seeds
Watch as the roots take hold
The country you are now poisoning
Condition critical
The higher, the farther, the faster you fly
I know it's true, and you can't deny me
Got nothing, got nothing, you got nothing to hide
Little bullshit whore, and you can't deny me
The higher, the farther, the faster you fly
It's all so sick, and you can't deny me
You can't deny me
You can't deny me
You don't defy me
You can't deny me
The higher, the farther, the faster you fly
You know you're sick, and you can't deny me
Got nothing, just nothing, got something to hide
We see right through you, and you can't deny me
Darkness, darkness, darkness and light
You can't deny me I'm ahead, I'm a man. I'm the first mammal to wear pants, yeah
I'm at peace with my lust. I can kill cause in
God I trust, yeah
It's evolution, baby
I'm at peace, I'm the man
Buying stocks on the day of the crash, yeah
On the loose, I'm a truck. all the rolling hills, I'll flatten em out, yeah
It's herd behavior, uh huh
It's evolution, baby
Admire me, admire my home, admire my son, he's my clone
Yeah, yeah. yeah, yeah
This land is mine, this land is free, I'll do what I want but irresponsibly
It's evolution, baby! I'm a thief, I'm a liar
hallelujah, hallelujah
Admire me, admire my home, admire my son, admire my clones
Cause we know, appetite for a nightly feast
Those ignorant
Indians got nothin on me
Nothin, why?
Because. it's evolution, baby! I am ahead, I am advanced, I am the first mammal to make plans, yeah
I crawled the earth, but now I'm higher
2010, watch it go to fire
It's evolution, baby
It's evolution, baby
Do the evolution
Come on. come on, come on
She lived on a curve in the road
An old tar paper shack
On the south side of the town
On the wrong side of the tracks
Sometimes on the way into town
We'd say, Mama can we stop and give her a ride?
Sometimes we did, but her hands flew from her side
Wild eyed crazy
Mary
Down a long dirt road
Past the
Parson's place
The old blue car
We used to race
Our little country store with a sign tacked to the side
Said, No L O I T E R I N G allowed
Underneath that sign always congregated quite a crowd
Take a bottle drink it down
Pass it around
Take a bottle drink it down
Pass it around
Pass it a
Take a bottle drink it down
Pass it a, pass it a, pass it around
One night a thunder cracked
Mercy backed outside her windowsill
I dreamed I was flying
High above the trees, over the hills
Looked down into the house of
Mary
A bare bulb on
Newspaper covered walls
And
Mary rising up above it all
Next morning on the way into town
We saw some skidmarks and followed them around
Over the curve, through the fields into the house of
Mary
That what you fear the most
Could meet you halfway
That what you fear the most
Could meet you halfway
Take a bottle drink it down
Pass it around
Take a bottle drink it down
Pass it a, pass it around
Take a bottle drink it down
Pass it a, pass it a, pass it around glorified g

Glorified version of a pellet gun 
Double think, dumb is strength
Never shot at a living thing
Glorified version of a pellet gun
Feels so manly, when armed
Glorified version of a pellet gun 
Glorified version of a.
Always keep it loaded 
Kindred to be an
American.
Life comes. I can feel your heart.
Ooh. life comes. I can feel your heart through your neck.
Life comes. I can feel your heart through your neck.
Like some. I can steal your heart form your neck.
Glorified. glorified.
Yeah, hey, hey
When somethings dark, let me shed a little light on it
When somethings cold, let me put a little fire on it
If somethings old, I wanna put a bit of shine on it
When somethings gone, I wanna fight to get it back again yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, fight to get it back again

Out of my mind. out of my mind.
All of the time.
Wish you could help me mister.
Wish you could lift me up.
Wish you could pack my parachute mister.
Wish you could pull me up.
The winds have change, I'm stuck beneath the rain.
I wish you could help me up.
Out of my mind. out of my mind.
Once inside, I'm out of my mind.
Out of my mind. out of my mind.
Once inside, I'm out of my mind.
Wish you could help me, give me a pill.
Just a little drink that I could swill.
A little something, anything, anything, I'll try all. I ain't got nowhere to go from here.
I'm just about this far
From drowning in my very own tears.
Out of my mind. out of my mind.
Once inside, I'm out of my mind.
Out of my mind. out of my mind. I don't feel so high.
out of my mind.
Where do I go?
Where do I stay?
I got no place to lay in the hay.
Where do I go to soothe my head?
Guess I'll turn on music instead.
Where do I see?
Where do I shine?
No one wants to take my mind.
Where do I go?
How do I feel?
Guess I'll waste away in here.
Out of my mind. out of my mind.
Out of my mind every single time.
Alone, listless, breakfast table in an otherwise empty room,
Young girl, violins, the center of her own attention,
The now mother reads aloud, child tries to understand it,
Tries to make her proud and the shades go.
Down, down into her head,
Painted room,
Can't deny,
Something's wrong,
Don't call me daughter, not fit to,
The picture kept will remind me,
Don't call me daughter, not fit to,
The picture kept will remind me,
Don't call me.
She holds the hands,
That holds her down,
She will, what?
Rise abooove,
Don't call me daughter, not fit to,
The picture kept will remind me,
Don't call me daughter, not fit to,
The picture kept will remind me,
Don't call me daughter, not fit to be,
The picture kept will remind me,
Don't call me.
The shades go down.
The shades go down.
The shades go down.
The shades go down. I'm gonna stand up here with you,
So, uhh, I'm gonna give you a part,
So I say It's okay then you say It's okay,
It's okay. it's okay
It's okay. it's okay,
You don't have to run away,
It's okay. it's okay,
You know I love you anyway,
This is my chance, this is my life,
And I'm alone in an alleyway,
This is my chance, this is my voice,
There may be no tomorrow now,
This is plea, this is my need,
And now my time is standing free,
This is my step, this is my day,
And in a new world let's never say,
It's okay. it's okay,
You know I love you anyway,
It's okay. it's okay,
You don't have to run and hide away,
It's okay,
It's okay,
It's okay,
It's okaaaaaay,
It's okaaay
She nursed him there over a night
I wasn't so sure she wanted him to stay
What to say?
What to say?
But soon she was down, soon he was low
At a quarter past, a holy no
She had to turn around
When she couldn't hold, oh, she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest path
Oh, a dissident, a dissident is here
And to this day, she's glided on
Always home but so far away, like a word misplaced
Nothing said, what a waste
But when she had contact with the conflict
There was meaning but she sold him to the state
She had to turn around
When she couldn't hold, she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest path
Oh, a dissident, a dissident is here
Oh, oh, oh.
She gave him away when she couldn't hold
No, she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest path
Oh, a dissident, a dissident is here
Oh, couldn't hold on
She couldn't hold, mo, she folded
A dissident is here
Escape is never the safest place
Oh, a dissident is here
Don't feel like home
He's a little out
And all these words alone
Is nothing like your poem
Putting in, inputting in
Don't feel like methadone
A scratching voice all alone
It's nothing like your baritone
It's nothing as it seems
The little that he needs, it's home
The little that he sees
Is nothing he can seize, it's home
One uninviting chromosome
A blanket like the ozone
It's nothing as it seems
All that he needs is home
The little that he frees
Is nothing he believes
Saving it for a sunny day
Something maybe, two tone
Anything of his own
A chip off the corner stone
Who's kidding?
Rainy day
A one way ticket headstone
An occupation's overthrown
A whisper through a megaphone
It's nothing as it seems
The little that he needs, it's home
The little that he sees
Is nothing he concedes, it's home
And all that he frees
A little bittersweet, it's home
It's nothing as it seems
The little that he sees, it's home
And I wished for so long. cannot stay.
All the precious moments. cannot stay.
It's not like wings have fallen. cannot stay.
But still something's missing. cannot say.
Holding hands of daughters and sons,
And their faiths are falling down, down, down, down.
I have wished for so long.
How I wish for you today.
Will I walk the long road?
Cannot stay.
There's no need to say goodbye.
say goodbye
All the friends and family.
All the memories going round, round, round, round.
I have wished for so long.
How I wish for you today.
And the wind keeps rollin,
And the sky keeps turning gray.
And the sun is set.
The sun will rise another day. I have wished for so long.
How I wish for you today.
I have wished for so long.
How I wish for you today.
Will I walk the long road?
We all walk the long road.
Can't know what's high
Til you been down so low
The future's bright
Lit up with no where to go
To and fro the pendulum throws
We are here and then we go
My shadow left me long ago
Understand what we don't know
This might pass, this might last, this may grow
Easy come easy go
Easy left me a long time ago I'm in the fire, but I'm still cold
Nothing works, works for me anymore
To and fro the pendulum throws
To and fro the pendulum throws
To and fro
To and fro I admit it.
What's to say.
I'll relive it.
Without pain.
Backstreet lover on the side of the road
I got a bomb in my temple that is gonna explode
I got a sixteen gauge buried under my clothes, I pray
Once upon a time
I could control myself
Ooh, once upon a time
I could lose myself, yeah.
Oh, try and mimic
What's insane.
I am in it.
Where do I stand?
Indian summer and I hate the heat
I got a backstreet lover on the passenger seat
I got my hand in my pocket, so determined, discreet
I pray.
Once upon a time
I could control myself
Ooh, once upon a time
I could lose myself, yeah, yeah.
You think I got my eyes closed
But I'm looking at you the whole fucking time.
Ooh, once upon a time
I could control myself, yeah.
Once upon a time
I could lose myself, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Once, upon a time
I could love myself, yeah.
Once upon a time
I could love you, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Once
Once
Once
Once
Yeah. once, once. yeah, yeah.
Yeah. yeah, yeah. yeah, yeah. oww. I've got a feeling. A feeling deep inside oh yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I've got a feeling. A feeling I can't hide oh no, no.
Whoa, no.
Yeah.
Yeah, I've got a feeling, yeah.
Oh please believe me. I'd hate to miss the train oh yeah.
Oh,

Haha.
Ooh, and if you leave me I won't be late again no no, no.
Oh,
no.
Yeah. I've got a feeling.
Yeah whew ooh oh yeah.
And I don't understand how come nobody told me.
Why I'd want to sing like a
Milli
Vanilli?
All I ever wanted was someone who looked like you.
You, oh.
I got a feeling that keeps me on my toes oh yeah yeah.
Oh yeah.
Uh huh. I got a feeling. I think that everybody knows, oh yeah,
yeah.
Oh yeah.
Yeah, wow I got a feeling.
Yeah, whoa.
Everybody had a good year though we never saw the sunshine.
Everybody had a wet dream.
Making
Temple was a good time.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Everybody made a movie.
Everybody had one line.
Everybody misses
Andy.
We'll be seeing him in no time.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Ooh, yeah. I got a feeling, yeah.
Oh.
I got a feeling. A feeling deep inside oh yeah yeah.
Oh yeah.
Ooh, I got a feeling. A feeling I can't hide oh no no.
Oh no.
Yeah, I got a feeling. yeah yeah ah ooh yeah.
All the thoughts you never see
You are always thinking
Brain is wide, the brain is deep
Oh, are you sinking?
Feel the path of every day
Which road you taking?
Breathing hard, making hay
Yeah, this is living
Look for love in evidence
That you're worth keeping
Swallowed whole in negatives
It's so sad and sickening
Feel the air up above
Oh, pool of blue sky
Fill the air up with love
All black with starlight
Feel the sky blanket you
With gems and rhinestones!
See the path cut by the moon
For you to walk on
For you to walk on.
Nothing left, nothing left
Nothing there, nothing here.
Nothing left, nothing left
Nothing there, nothing left.
Nothing left, nothing left
Nothing there, nothing here.
See the path cut by the moon
For you to walk on
See the waves on distant shores
Awaiting your arrival
Dream the dreams of other men
You'll be no one's rival
Dream the dreams of others then
You will be no one's rival
You will be no one's rival.
A distant time, a distant space
That's where we're living
A distant time, a distant place
So what ya giving?
What ya giving?
Underneath this smile lies everything
All my hopes and anger, pride and shame
Make myself a pact not to shut doors on the past
Just for today I am free I will not lose my faith
It's an inside job today
I know this one thing well I used to try to kill love, was the highest sin
Breathing insecurity out and in
Searching hope, I'm shown the way to run straight
Pursuing the greater way for all human light
How I choose to feel is how I am
How I choose to feel is how I am
I will not lose my faith
It's an inside job today
Holding on, the light of night
On my knees to rise and fix my broken soul
Again
Let me run into the rain
To be a human light again
Let me run into the rain
To shine a human light today
Life comes from within your heart and desire
Oh, life comes from within my heart and desire
Oh, life comes from within your heart and desire
Yeah, yeah
Run in rain
Don't it make you smile?
Don't it make you smile?
When the sun don't shine?
It don't shine at all
Don't it make you smile?
Don't it make you smile?
Don't it make me smile?
When the sun don't shine, it don't shine at all
Don't it make me smile?
I miss you already
I miss you always I miss you already
I miss you all day
This is how I feel
I miss you already
I miss you always
Three crooked hearts and swirls all around
I miss you all day
Here I stand head in hand, turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on, feeling two foot small
Oh, everywhere people stare, I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them in the state I'm in
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Why should I even try? I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them in the state I'm in
How could she say to me, Love will find a way?
Gather round, all you clowns, let me hear you say
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Drive down the street can't find the keys to my own fucking home.
I'll take a walk so I could curse my ass for being dumb.
I'll make a right, after the arches, stinking grease and bone.
Stopped at the supermarket people stare like I'm a dog. I'm going to
Lukin's.
I've got a spot at
Lukin's.
I knocked the door at
Lukin's.
Open the fridge.
Now I know life is worth. I found the key but I return to find an open door.
Some fucking freak who claims I fathered, by rape, her own son.
I find my wife, I call the cops, this days work's never done.
The last I heard that freak was purchasing a fucking gun.
Oh, please, don't go out on me, don't go on me now
Never acted up before, don't go on me now
I swear I never took it for granted, just thought of it now
Suppose I abused you, just passing it on
Go
Fuck
Once fastened, servile
Now you're getting sharp
Moving oh so swiftly with such disarm
I pulled the covers over your head, should've pulled the alarm
Turned to my nemesis, a fool, not a fucking god
No
Time
Suck
My
Please don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Please
Oh
Suck
Blood
Touch
Please
Tunnel vision
Tuck
Time
See
Please, please, please
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Don't go on me
Please, don't you want me?
Don't go on me
Please, don't go on me
Vedder to
Crowd:
I'm going to stand here with you. I'm going to give you a part, I say It's OK and you say It's O.K.
It's ok.
Vedder and crowd, It's ok!

Crowd:

You don't have to run and hide away
It's ok
It's ok
You know I love you anyway
It's ok, it's ok
This is my chance, this is my life,
This is my hope in an alleyway
This is my chance, this is my voice
There may be no more tomorrow
This my plea
This is my need
And my time of standing free
This is my step
This is my day
And the world is never the same
It's ok
It's ok
You know I love you anyway
Its ok
It's ok
You don't have to run and hide away
It's ok
It's ok
It's ok .
It's
Okaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay.
Oh
It's kayyyyy
What were all those dreams we shared those many years ago?
What were all those plans we made now left beside the road?
Behind us in the road.
More than friends, I always pledged cause friends they come and go
People change as does everything, I wanted to grow old
Just want to grow old. 

Slide on next to me, I'm just a human being
I will take the blame but just the same, this is not me
You see, believe, I'm better than this
Don't leave me so cold, I'm buried beneath the stones
I just want to hold on and know I'm worth your love
Enough, I don't think, there's such a thing.
It's my fault, now I've been caught a sickness in my bones.
How it pains to leave you here with the kids on your own.
Just don't let me go. 

Help me see myself, cause I can no longer tell
Looking up from inside of the bottom of a well
it's
Hell, I yell, but no one hears
Before I disappear, whisper in my ear
Give me something to echo in my unknown futures ear
My dear, the end, comes near, I'm here, but not much longer. I've used hammers made out of wood
I have played games with pieces and rules
I've deciphered tricks at the bar
But now you're gone
I haven't figured out why
I've come up with riddles
And jokes about war
I've figured out numbers and what they're for
I've understood feelings
And I've understood words
But how could you be taken away?
And wherever you've gone, and wherever we might go
It don't seem fair, today just disappeared
Your light's reflected now, reflected from a far
We were but stones, your light made us stars
With heavy breath awakens regret
Back pages and days that could've been spent
Together, but we're miles apart
Every inch between us becomes light years now
No time to be void or save up on life
You've got to spend it all
And wherever you've gone, and wherever we might go
It don't seem fair, today just disappeared
Your light's reflected now, reflected from a far
We were but stones, your light made us stars
See this needle, 
Oh see my hand.
Drop, drop, dropping it down, oh, so gently.
Well, here it comes, I touch the plane,
Turn me up. won't turn you away.
Spin, spin. spin the black circle.
Spin, spin. spin the black, spin the black.
Spin, spin. spin the black circle.
Spin, spin. whoa.
Pull it out, a paper sleeve.
Oh, my joy. only you deserve conceit.
I'm so big. a-my whole world.
I'd rather you. rather you than her.
Spin, spin. spin the black circle.
Spin, spin. spin the black, spin the black.
Spin, spin. spin the black circle.
Spin, spin. whoa. oh.
You're so warm.
Oh, the ritual when I lay down your crooked arm.
Spin, spin. spin the black circle.
Spin, spin. spin the black, spin the black.
Spin, spin. spin the black circle.
Spin, spin.
Spin the black  circle.
Spin the black circle. 
Spin, spin. 
You fool
Dude what do you think you're doing
So you're lost
My problem is not
Conductor says
Off of my train
Be understood
Guess those relationships ain't my thing
Even if I could
You ain't the kinda person I would help anyway
I'm about to explode
Cause I can't carry your load
Hitchhiker
You're cool
and coke and your calculations
We're friends
Only because of my situation
I'm about to unload
Cause I can't carry your load
Hitchhiker
So be gone
Too soon is too late
I want no delay
So be gone
Get your food of someone else's plate
Go tell all of your friends
I'm an idiot and you're great
Hitchhiker
Now
Go.
Do you see the way that tree bends?
Does it inspire?
Leaning out to catch the sun's rays.
A lesson to be applied.
Are you getting something out of this all-encompassing trip?
You can spend your time alone redigesting past regrets, oh.
Or you can come to terms and realize,
You're the only one who can't forgive yourself, oh.
Makes much more sense to live in the present tense.
Have you ideas on how this life ends?
Checked your hands and studied the lines.
Have you ever believed that the road ahead ascends off into the light?
Seems that needlessly it's getting harder
To find an approach and a way to live.
Are we getting something out of this all-encompassing trip?
You can spend your time alone redigesting past regrets, oh.
Or you can come to terms and realize,
You're the only one who can't forgive yourself, oh.
Makes much more sense to live in the present tense.
Don't even think about reachin me
I won't be home
Don't even think about stoppin by
Don't think of me at all I did, what I had to do
If there was a reason, it was you
Don't even think about gettin inside
Voices in my head
Oh, voices
I got scratches, all over my arms
One for each day, since I fell apart
I did, what I had to do
And if there was a reason, it was you, oh
Footsteps in the hole, it was you, you
Oh oh
Pictures on my chest, it was you, it was you
I did, what I had to do
And if there was a reason
There wasn't no reason, no
And if there's something you'd like to do
Oh, just let me continue
To blame you, oh oh
Footsteps in the hole, it was you, you
Oh oh
Pictures on my chest, it was you, it was you
All the photographs were peeling
And colors turned to gray, he stayed
in his room with memories for days, he faced
an undertow of futures laid to waste, embraced
by the loss of one what he could not replace
There's no reason that she passed
and there is no god with a plan, it's sad
and his loneliness is proof, it's sad
he could only love you, it's sad
The door swings to a passing fable
a fate we may delay, we say
holding on, delivered in our own brace
eleven nights he laid in bed
hoping that dreams will bring her back, it's sad
and his loneliness is proof, it's sad
he could only love you, it's sad
Holding his last breath, believing
he'll make his way
but she's not forgotten
he's haunted
he's searching for escape
If just one wish could bring her back, it's send
and his loneliness is proof, it's sad
he will always love you, it's sad
My lips are shakin
My nails are bit off
It's been a month since I've heard myself talk
Only advantage this life's got on me
Picture a cup in the middle of the sea
And I fought back in my mind
Never lets me be right.
I got memories, I got shit
So much it don't show.
Oh, I walked the line.
When you held me in at night
Oh, I walked the line.
When you held my hand and i.
On empty shells seem so easy to crack
Got all these questions
Don't know who I could even ask
So I'll just lie down and wait for the dream
Where I'm not ugly and you're lookin at me
And I'll stay in bed.
Oh, little I've seen there
If just once I could be loved.
Oh, I'd stare back at me
Oh, I walked the line.
When you held me in at night
Oh, I walked the line.
When you held my hand and i
Oh, I walked the line.
When you held me close at night
Oh, I paid the price.
Never held you in your eyes
Oh, how I wish you were here
We were just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
And now I'm running over
That same old ground
What have I found?
The same old fears
Oh, how I wish you were here
So you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade
All your heroes for ghosts
Hot ashes for trees
Hot air for a cool breeze
Cold comfort for change?
Did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?
Oh, how I wish you were here
We were just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
And now I'm running over
The same old ground
What have I found?
The same old fears
Sure do wish you were here
Sure do wish you were here
God, I wish you were here I'm questioning my education
Is my education all i am now?
While you're deciding i've been finding
Looking around in the here and now
If I'd been taught from the beginning
Would my fears now be winning? I'm questioning my own equation
Is my own equation relevant somehow
The flags will wave and the news is breaking
See the man who came, forgot his own tie
If I'd been taught from the beginning
Would my fears now be winning?
A wild world, figured out the answers
I'll be in my own, dancing out, ou-out yeaaah I'm questioning my education
Rewinding, what does it show?
Could be, the truth, it becomes you
I'm a seed wondering why i'm grown. I took a drive today
Time to emancipate
I guess it was the beatings, made me wise
But I'm not about to give thanks or apologize I couldn't breathe, holdin me down
Hand on my face, pushed to the ground
Enmity gaged, united by fear
Forced to endure what I could not forgive I seem to look away
Wounds in the mirror waved
It wasn't my surface
Most defiled
Head at your feet, fool to your crown
Fist on my plate, swallowed it down
Enmity gaged, united by fear
Tried to endure what I could not forgive
Saw things, saw things
Saw things, saw things
Clearer, clearer
Once you, were in my rear view mirror I gather speed from you fucking with me
Once and for all, I'm far away
I hardly believe, finally the shades
Are raised, hey
Saw things so much clearer
Once you, once you
Rear view mirror
Saw things so much clearer
Once you, once you
Rear view mirror
Saw things so much clearer
Once you, once you
Rear view mirror
Saw things so much clearer
Once you
Oh yeah he say to her he wants it easy

and she says no when she says no, you gotta stop

when he says go, you still gotta stop she did nothing to deserve it
he just wants, he wants to observe it

She scratches a letter, into a wall made of stone
Maybe someday another child, won't feel as alone as she does.
It's been two years and counting
Since they put her in this place
She's been diagnosed, by some stupid fuck
And mommy agrees, yeah
Why go home, why go home, why go home?
She seems to be stronger
But what they want her to be. is weak
She could play pretend, she could join the game, boy
She could be another clone
Oh, uh, ah yeah
Why go home, why go home, why go home, why go home?
What you taught me 
Why go home?
Put me here 
Why go home?
Don't come visit 
Why go home?

Why go home?
Put me here 
Why go home?
Don't come visit 
Why go home?
Mother,
Mother, yeah
Why go home, why go home, why go home, why go home? I shut and locked the front door
No way in or out
I turned and walked the hallway
And pulled the curtains down
I knelt and emptied the mouth of every plug around
But nothing's sound, nothing's sound I stayed where my last cap left me
Ignored all my rounds
Soon I was seeing visions and cracks along the walls
They're upside down I swallow my words to keep from lying
I swallow my face just to keep from biting, I, I.
I swallowed my breath and went deep, I was diving, diving
I surfaced and all of my being was enlightened
Now. I'm in hiding, yeah
I'm in hiding, yeah
I'm in hiding, yeah
I'm in hiding
It's been about three days now
Since I've been aground
No longer overwhelmed and it seems so simple now
It's funny when things change so much
It's all state of mind I swallowed my words to keep from lying
I swallowed my face just to keep from biting, I, I
I swallowed my breath and went deep, I was diving, I was diving
I surfaced and all of my being was enlightened
Now I'm in hiding, yeah
I'm in hiding, yeah
I'm in hiding, yeah
Now I'm in hiding, yeah
I'm in hiding, yeah
I'm in hiding, yeah
I'm in hiding, yeah
I'm in hiding.
Ah, is there room for both of us?
Both of us apart?
Are we bound out of obligation?
Is that all we've got? I get the words and then I get to thinking
I don't wanna think, I wanna feel
How do I feel?
How do I?
If you're the only one, will I never be enough, yeah
Hail, hail the lucky ones
I refer to those in love, yeah
Oh, how I'd love you till the day I die. and beyond
Are we going to the same place?
If so, can I come?

All the past we carry
Oh, I could be new
You under-estimate me
If you're the only one, will I never be enough, yeah
Hail, hail the lucky ones
I refer to those in love, yeah I sometimes realize I could only be as good as you'll let me
Are you woman enough to be my man?
Bandaged hand in hand
Black lining
On the run in a race that can't be won, yeah
Oh, hail, hail the lucky ones

In two weeks, before she could see herself not dressed
The twenty-third of
May, you know she disturbed no one today
The manager told her to completely forget
If you ever go to bed, I'll kill you
Do I tell the whole world that I'm mentally ill?
Go to the papers, yeah, why not?
Drum roll I want to show them that I can walk on my own
Without hands of theirs
And I can still fantasize, but I keep it to myself
Keep it to myself, keep it to myself I think I deserve to be loved, don't you?
Very much so
Think I deserve to be loved
Keep it to myself, keep it to myself I think I deserve to be loved, don't you?

Yes, I believe I would
Winded is the sailor drifting by the storm,
Wounded is the organ he left all bloodied on the shore.
Gorgeous was his savior, sees her, drowning in his wake.
Daily taste the salt of her tears, but a chance blamed fate.
Little secrets, tremors, turned to quake.
The smallest oceans still get big, big waves.
Ransom paid the devil. he whispers pleasing words.
Triumphant are the angels if they can get there first.
Little secrets, tremors, turned to quake.
The smallest oceans still get big, big waves. I'll decide. take the dive.
Take my time. not my life.
Wait for signs. believe in lies.
To get by. it's divine, whoa.
Oh, you know what it's like.
Turns the bow back, tows, and drops the line,
Puts his faith in love and tremor
Christ.
Cold wind blows on the soles of my feet
Heaven knows nothing of me
I'm lost, nowhere to go
Oh, when I was a kid. oh, how magic it seemed
Oh, please let me sleep, it's
Christmas time
Flowered winds was where I lived
Thought you burned, not froze for your sins
Oh, I'm so tired, and cold
Oh, when I was a kid. oh, how magic it seemed
Oh, please let me sleep, it's
Christmas time
Oh. oh, when I was a kid. oh, how magic it seemed
Oh, please let me sleep, it's
Christmas time
Oh. oh, when I, if I was a kid. oh, how magic it seemed
Oh, please let me dream, it's
Christmas time 

In my eyes
Indisposed
In disguises no one knows
Hides the face
Lies the snake
And the sun in my disgrace
Boiling heat
Summer stench
Neath the black, the sky looks dead
Call my name
Through the cream
And I'll hear you scream again
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come
Won't you come?
Stuttering
Cold and damp
Steal the warm wind, tired friend
Times are gone
For honest men
Sometimes, far too long for snakes
In my shoes
Walking sleep
In my youth, I pray to keep
Heaven send
Hell away
No one sings like you anymore
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come 
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come 
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come 
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come? 
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Hang my head
Drown my fear
Till you all just disappear
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come 
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come
 
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come 
Black hole sun, black hole sun

Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come 
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come
 
Black hole sun, black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come?
Whatsoever I've feared has come to life
Whatsoever I've fought off became my life
Just when every day seemed to greet me with a smile
Sunspots have faded and now I'm doing time
Now I'm doing time
Cause I've fell on black days
I've fell on black days 
black days
Whomsoever I've cured, I've sickened now
Whomsoever I've cradled, I've put you down
searchlight so they say, but I can't see it in the night
I'm only faking when I get it right
When I get it right
Cause I've fell on black days
I've fell on black days 
black days
How would I know that this could be my fate?
How would I know that this could be my fate?
So what you wanted to see good has made you blind
And what you wanted to be yours, you've made it mine
So don't you lock up something that you wanted to see fly
Hands are for shaking, no, not tying
No, not tying I sure don't mind a change
I sure don't mind a change
Yeah, I sure don't mind
I sure don't mind a change
I sure don't mind a change
But I've fell on black days

How would I know that this could be my fate?
How would I know that this could be my fate?

Oh I'm feeling
Oh I'm feeling
outshined, outshined, outshined, outshined I woke the same as any other day
Except a voice was in my head
It said, Seize the day, pull the trigger
Drop the blade and watch the rolling heads
The day I tried to live I stole a thousand beggar's change
And gave it to the rich, yeah
The day I tried to win I dangled from the power lines
And let the martyrs stretch, yeah
Singing one more time around
Might do it
One more time around
Might make it
One more time around
Might do it
One more time around
might make it
The day I tried to live
Words you say, never seem
To live up to the ones inside your head
The lives we make never seem
To ever get us anywhere but dead
The day I tried to live
I wallowed in the blood and mud
With all the other pigs, hey
Singing one more time around 
Might do it
One more time around
Might make it
One more time around
Might do it
One more time around
Might make it
The day I tried to live, yeah, I tried
I woke the same as any other day you know
I should have stayed in bed
The day I tried to win I wallowed
In the blood and mud with all the other pigs
And I learned that I was a liar
One more time around
 I learned that I was a liar
One more time around
I learned that I was a liar 
One more time around
I learned that I was a liar
One more time around
Singing one more time around 
Might do it
One more time around
Might make it
One more time around
Might do it
One more time around
The day I tried to live
Just like you
Just like you
One more time around
One more time around
Heard it from another room
Eyes were waking up
Just to fall asleep
Love's like suicide
Dazed out in a garden bed
With a broken neck
Lays my broken gift
Just like suicide
And my last ditch
Was my last brick
Lent to finish her
Finish her
She lived like a murder
How she'd fly so sweetly
She lived like a murder
But she died just like suicide
Bit down on the bullet now
I had a taste so sour
I had to think of something sweet
Love's like suicide
Safe outside my gilded cage
With an ounce of pain
I wield a ton of rage
Just like suicide
With eyes of blood
And bitter blue
How I feel for you
I feel for you
She lived like a murder
How she'd fly so sweetly
She lived like a murder
But she died just like suicide
Yeah
And my last ditch
Was my last brick
Lent to finish her
Finish her
With eyes of blood
And bitter blue
How I feel for you
I feel for you
I feel for you I feel for you
I feel, oh
I feel for you
She lived like a murder
How she'd fly so sweetly
She lived like a murder
But she died just like suicide I caught the moon today
Pick it up and throw it away, all right
I got the perfect steal
A cleaner love with a dirty feel all right
Fallout and take the bait, eat the fruit
And kiss the snake goodnight
Common ruse, dirty face
Pretty noose is pretty hate
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
Let your motor race
Pick it up and get this mother gone
Out from and far away, the wooden stake
This thing has got me on
Diamond rope silver chain
Pretty noose is a pretty pain
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
Common ruse, dirty face
Pretty noose is pretty hate
I don't care what you got
I don't care what you need, I don't want anything
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
And I don't like what you got me hanging from
Follow me into the desert
As thirsty as you are
Crack a smile and cut your mouth
And drown in alcohol
Cause down below the truth is lying
Beneath the river bed quench yourself and drink the water
That flows below her head
Oh no there she goes
Out in the sunshine
The sun is mine, sun is mine
I shot my love today
Would you cry for me I lost my head again
Would you lie for me
Close your eyes and bow your head
I need a little sympathy
Cause fear is strong and love's for everyone
Who isn't me
Kill your health and kill yourself
And kill everything you love
And if you live you can fall to pieces
And suffer with my ghost
I shot my love today
Would you cry for me I lost my head again
Would you lie for me
I left her in the sand
Just a burden in my hand
I lost my head again
Would you cry for me
Just a burden in my hand
Just an anchor on my heart
It's just a tumor in my head
And I'm in the dark
So follow me into the desert
As desperate as you are
Where the moon is glued
To a picture of heaven
And all the little pigs have
God
Oh no there she goes
Out in the sunshine
The sun is mine, the sun is mine
I shot my love today
Would you cry for me, yeah
I lost my head again
Would you lie for me
I left her in the sand
Just a burden in my hand
I lost my head again
Would you cry for me
Would you cry for me
You wired me awake
and hit me with a hand of broken nails
you tied my lead and pulled my chain
to watch my blood begin to boil
But I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
Yeah, I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage
And run
Too cold to start a fire
I'm burning diesel burning dinosaur bones
I'll take the river down to still water
And ride a pack of dogs
But I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
Yeah, I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage
And run
Hits like a
Phillips head into my brain
It's gonna be too dark to sleep again
Cutting my teeth on bars and rusty chains
I'm gonna break my rusty cage
And run
When the forest burns along the road
Like
God's eyes in my headlights
And when the dogs are looking for their bones
And it's raining ice picks on your steel shore
But I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage and run
Yeah, I'm gonna break
I'm gonna break my
I'm gonna break my rusty cage
And run
Hello don't you know me
I'm the dirt beneath your feet
The most important fool you forgot to see
I've seen how you give it
Now I want you to receive
I'm sure for you would do the same for me
Cause I know I'm headed for the bottom
I know I'm headed for the bottom
I know I'm headed for the bottom
But I'm riding you all the way
Yeah I'm riding you all the way

For all of your kisses turned to spit in my face
For all that reminds me which is my place
For all of the times when you made me disappear
This time I'm sure you will know that I'm here I know I'm headed for the bottom
I know I'm headed for the bottom
I know I'm headed for the bottom
But I'm riding you all the way

Riding. riding. all the way
My place was beneath you but now I am above
And now I send you a message of love
A simple reminder of what you won't see
A future so holy without me I know I'm headed for the bottom
I know I'm headed for the bottom
I know I'm headed for the.
But I'm riding you all the way
Yeah I'm riding you all the way
I'm riding you all the way
Oh I'm riding you.
Yes I'm riding you.
I'm riding you.
Yes I'm riding you.
I'm riding you all the way
Take, if you want a slice
If you want a piece
If it feels alright
Break, if you like the sound
If it gets you up
If it brings you down
Share, if it makes you sleep
If it sets you free
If it helps you breathe
Don't come over here
And piss on my gate
Save it, just keep it
Off my wave
Cry, if you want to cry
If it helps you see
If it clears your eyes
Hate, if you want to hate
If it keeps you safe
If it makes you brave
Pray, if you want to pray
If you like to kneel
If you like to lay

Shower in the dark day clean sparks diving down
Cool in the waterway where the baptized drown
Naked in the cold sun breathing life like fire
I thought I was the only one but that was just a lie
Cause I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
I thought it was the 4th of
July
Pale in the flare light the scared light cracks and disappears
And leads the scorched ones here
And everywhere no one cares the fire is spreading
And no one wants to speak about it
Down in the hole
Jesus tries to crack a smile
Beneath another shovel load
And I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
I thought it was the 4th of
July
And I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end I thought it was the 4th of
July
July,
July
Now I'm in control now I'm in the fall out
Once asleep but now I stand
And I still remember your sweet everything
Light a
Roman candle and hold it in your hand
Cause I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end I thought it was the 4th of
July
Cause I heard it in the wind
And I saw it in the sky
And I thought it was the end
I thought it was the 4th of
July, yeah
Nothing, seems to kill me
No matter how hard I try
Nothing's closing my eyes
Nothing can beat me down
For your pain or delight, no
And nothing, seems to break me
No matter how far I fall
Nothing can break me at all
Not one for giving up
Though not invincible, I know I've given everything I need
I'd give you everything I own
I'd give in if it could at least be ours alone
I've given everything I could
To blow it to hell and gone
Burrow down in and
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside world
Someone, tried to tell me something
Don't let the world, bring you down
Nothing can do me in, before I do myself
So save it for your own, and the ones you can help, no I've given everything I need
I'd give you everything I own
I'd give in if it could at least be ours alone
I've given everything I could
To blow it to hell and gone
Burrow down in and
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside world
Want to make it understood
Wanting though I never would
Trying though I know it's wrong
Blowing it to hell and gone
Wishing though I never could
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside world 
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside world
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
Blow up the outside
And you stare at me
In your
Jesus
Christ pose
Arms held out
Like you've been carrying a load
And you swear to me
You don't wanna be my slave
But you're staring at me
Like I.
Like I need to be.
Saved
Saved
Like I need to be.

Arms held out
In your

Christ pose
Thorns and shroud
Like it's the coming of the
Lord
And I swear to you
That I would never feed you pain
But you're staring at me
Like I.
Like I'm driving the.

Like it's the coming of the lord
Would it pay you more to walk on water
Than to wear a crown of thorns
It wouldn't pain me more to bury you rich
Than to bury you poor
In your

What if all you understand
Could fit into the center of our hand
Then you found it wasn't you
Who held the sum of everything you knew
We're insane but not alone
You hold on
And they're gone
Like the sun we will live to rise
Like the sun we will live and die
And then ignite again
Like the sun we will live to rise again
What if the one thing that I missed
Was everything I need to pass the test
And if I fail what happens then
Can I still count on you as a friend
We're insane but not alone
You hold on
And they're gone
Like the sun we will live to rise
Like the sun we will live and die
And then ignite again
Like the sun we will live to rise again
Again
Again
Again
Warm my face
Warm your face
Warm my face
Warm your face
Warm my face
Warm your face
Like the sun we will live to rise
Like the sun we will live and die
And then ignite again
Like the sun we will live to rise
Like the sun we will live and die
And then ignite again
Like the sun we will live to rise again
Again
You better know what you want
You know how little I got
I can't give you anything
You think that I'm real cute
But who's gonna bring home the loot?
Make up your mind about
Hope you don't doubt that
I can't give you anything
There's no time to keep it low
I've been deaf and now I want noise
You stay down
But I won't be quiet
I'll hammer on until you fight
Loud love
Loud love
Loud love
Loud love
Hammer on, till you fly
If you've got some time to kill
Slow resistance wins the war
Well I know
Yea, but that's no way to go
You can't resist the louder pull
Loud love
Loud love
Loud love
Loud love
Cant resist,
Loud love
All right
Well that's right
I want something to explode
I've been deaf
Now I want noise
Loud love
Loud love
Loud love
Loud love

Unreleased
Ocean fronts, ocean new
See it from my waiting room
Hear it in my hollow walls
Just like a shell, hear it call
From my waiting room
Ocean fronts, guard by fire
Liquid mist, hide the shore
Underneath cities float
Back and forth I hear the flow
From my waiting room
Ocean violence killing calm
Crashing over the under world
Ocean silence under breath
Words do flow to reach me
Come on in and take me on an override
Been stuck inside and up all night at
Dave's
Now trouble's far away, and mother in her cage
And nothings gonna pinch this nerve of mine I wanna make it right
I wanna make it right
Close the door and pull the shades
And climb the walls
Feel medicine heal the lines of age
I'm here and now I'm gone
I'm there and far beyond
And nothing's gonna pinch this nerve of mine
Nothing's gonna pinch this nerve of mine I wanna make it right
I wanna make it right I'm on the wire over and higher
Over the pretense over the 
spire
 why
On and connected
I'm overfloating now
I'm overfloating now
I'm overfloating now
I'm overfloating
Alone, lone, lone, lone
Alone, lone, lone, lone
Alone, lone, lone, lone
Breathe and take in and gently blow it on
Drink it down and swallow hard and gaze
Hold the potion up
Stare your shadow down
Remember to forget and then rename your shame I wanna make it right
I wanna make it right
I wanna make it right
I wanna make it right I'm on the wire over and higher
Over the pretense over the 
spire
 why
On and connected
I'm overfloating now
Alone, lone, lone, lone
I'm overfloating now
I'm overfloating now
I'm overfloating
Alone, lone, lone, lone
Get on the snake
With a swarm of motor flies
Get on the snake
Under the cola colored sky
No, don't worry, everything's clean
Road worthy, hungry and mean
Get on the snake
Where the metal river bleeds
Get on the snake
Where you never will believe
Hey baby, what's your disease
My heart's bleeding
I'm dying to leave
Get on the snake
Where the water turns to steam
Get on the snake
With a suicide machine
Don't worry, everything's clean
Road worthy, hungry and mean
Hungry and mean.
Hungry and mean.
Lying like needles
On forest earth
Euphoric rush
Trees bend to pray for us
I'm sputtering
Like cold machines
Late for the birth ritual, ritual, ritual, ritual
You can drive my tail
To watch the circus
A 
birth?
 ritual
A birth of idiots
Now I woke up blessed
And good strives for heart ache
Marked for the death ritual, ritual, ritual
As you start the song
And face this garden
I light a cigarette before the execution
Now you see your crime
For every miracle
Add another drug at every birth ritual
I took the drug
To make me stay
And now everything
Dies in shyness
The snake retreats
Admits defeat
And waits for the birth ritual, ritual, ritual
As you start the song
And face this garden
I light a cigarette before the execution
Now you see your crime
For every miracle
Add another drug at every birth ritual
Shining light
Child's highs
Mark his sides
Bright until the newness wears off
As you start the song
And face this garden
I light a cigarette before the execution
Now you see your crime
For every miracle
Add another drug at every birth ritual
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling gotta row
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling gotta row
Moving is breathing and breathing is life
Stopping is dying you'll be alright
Life is a hammer waiting to drop
Adrift in the shallows and the rowing won't stop
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling gotta row
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling gotta row
Can't see the sky nothing on the horizon
Can't feel my hands and the water keeps rising
Can't fall asleep cause I'll wake up dead
I just keep on pulling I just keep on rolling
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling gotta row
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling gotta row
Rowing is living and living is hard
But living beats losing all that we are
All that we know of and all that we feel
All we remember imagined or real
All we remember imagined or real I heard an echo but the answer had changed
From the word I remember that I started out saying
Living is cheating if you're not pulling oars
But the current is leaving I'll get mine, you'll get yours
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling gotta row
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling gotta row
Rowing is bleeding, bleeding is breathing
Breathing is feeling burning and freezing
Keep getting dirty but I started out clean
Keep on rowing I keep on rowing I
Keep on pulling I keep on pulling I
Keep on rowing I keep on rowing I
Keep on rowing I keep on rowing I
Keeeeeeeep on rolling
Keep on rolling
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling gotta row
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling gotta row
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling gotta row
Don't know where I'm going I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling gotta row
Don't you don't you want to thrill me
Don't you be afraid to tell me
Tell me if you think it's ugly
But now don't you want to touch it anyway I've been looking for a reject

Tears of the feeble, hands of the slaves
Skin of the mothers, mouths of the babes
Building the towers, belongs to the sky
When the whole thing comes crashing down
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why
Under the shelf, the shelf of the sky
Two eyes two suns, too heavenly blinds
Swallowing rivers, belongs to the sea
When the whole thing washes away
Don't run to me I'll be going down, for the rest of the slide
While the rest of you harvest the gold
And the wreck of you, is the death of you all
And the wreck of you, is the break and the fall
I'm the wreck of you, I'm the death of you all
I'm the wreck of you, I'm the break and the fall
Under the red, break of the lights
Heroes in stretches, inch to the site
Blowing to pieces belong to the wind
When the whole thing blows away
I won't pretend I'll be going down, for the rest of the slide
While the rest of you harvest the souls
And the wreck of you, is the death of you all
And the wreck of you, is the break and the fall
I'm the wreck of you, I'm the death of you all
I'm the death of you, I'm the break and the fall
Behind the blood red break of the lights
Lies the wreck of you for the rest of your life
And the wreck of you, is the death of you all
And the wreck of you, is the break and the fall
I'm the wreck of you, I'm the death of you all
I'm the death of you, I'm the break and the fall
This is my good eye
Do you hear a cow?
A rooster says
Here is a pig
The devil says
Painted blue across my eyes,
and tie the linen on
And I'm on my way,
on my way
Looking for the paradigm,
so I can pass it off
Is it on my side,
on my side
Is it to the sky,
is it to the sky,
Is it to the sky, now
Searching for a ground
With my good eye closed
If I took you for a ride,
would you take it wrong,
or would you make it right,
make it right
Looking for a pedestal,
that I can put you on,
and be on my way,
on my way
Is it to the sky,
Is it to the sky,
Is it to the sky, now
Searching for a ground
With my good eye closed
With my good eye closed
With my good eye closed
With my good eye closed
With my good eye closed
With my good eye closed
With my good eye closed
Stop you're trying to bruise my mind
I can do it on my own
Stop you're trying to kill my time
It's been my death since I was born
I don't remember half the time
If I'm hiding or I'm lost
But I'm on my way, on my way
Is it to the sky,
is it to the sky,
is it to the sky,
is it to the sky,
And i'm on my way,
on my way,
on my way,
I'm on my way, yeah
I'm on my way, yeah
on my way, yeah
Is it to the sky,
is it to the sky
On my way,
on my way
Is it to the sky,

Head injury, head injury, head injury
You got a kiss for me, it hits me hard
My hands on my head, your words are like arrows
My hands on my head, there's permanent damage 
Head injury, head injury, head injury 
You got a kiss for me, it's sweet and frail
You got a fist for me, sure to impale
My hand on my head, your words are like arrows
My hand on my head, my mind in shambles
Head injury I think I know the answer
I stumbled on and the world
fell down
and all the sky went silent
cracked like glass and slowly
tumbled to the ground
they say if you look hard
you'll find your way back home
born without a friend
and bound to die alone I'm thinking of your highness
and crying upon the loss
I've found
and on the plus and minus
zero chance of ever turning this around why doesn't anyone believe in lonliness
stand up and everyone will see your holiness they say if you look real hard
you'll find your way back home
born without a friend
and bound to die alone
If I could hug my love, could I try
For your wings to cover me, unless I fall
Half alive I hurt the most brilliant lie
Sleepless eyes, close the light
And rest your mind while you burn
Can't stutter when you're talking with your eyes
By cutting out your tongue you save face
Feeding on the blood lets running from a black day
Cry on black rain
Cry on black rain
Cry on black rain
If I could hug my love, could I try
For your wings to cover me, unless I fall
Sleepless eyes, close the light
And rest your mind while you burn
You can't stutter when you're talking with your eyes
By cutting out your tongue you save face
Feeding on the blood lets running from a black day
Cry on black rain
Cry on black rain
Cry on, cry on black rain
Black rain, cry on, black rain
Cry on, cry on
You can't stutter when you're talking with your eyes
By cutting out your tongue you save face
Feeding on the blood that's running from a black day
She looked at me with dignity
She said there's something you gotta see
Even though this country's headed for war
This nation is prouder than ever before
Yeah that was spirit in the air
We're more
American than anywhere
And I just smile cause I could tell
This little girl was going to
Hell
Now I wouldn't mind
If you swallowed my pride
Make me feel alright
Yeah now deep inside
Feel alright
Hey, all the warmth in her heart
Couldn't keep my blood from running cold
Cause I fell for her looks
Now I wanna go for her throne
I tried to tell her a thousand times
But little girl didn't understand at all
Now I wouldn't mind
If you swallow my pride
Make me feel alright
Yeah now deep inside
Feel alright
Alright
You can swallow my pride
Now I wouldn't mind
If you swallowed my pride
Make me feel alright, deep inside
Feel alright
Pride. pride. pride
You can swallow my pride I must obey the rules
I must be tame and cool
No staring at the clouds
I must stay on the ground
In clusters of the mice
The smoke is in our eyes
Like babies on display
Like
Angels in a cage I must be pure and true
I must contain my views
There must be something else
There must be something good far away
I'm far away from here
Far away, I'm far away from here
Far away, I'm far away from here
Far away, I'm far away from here
Lonely is the bird
Boot camp I've got war on my mind blood on my hands
And love on my head
So open your hands open your mouth
Let it be said
You know I've got it mad in my mind
Don't waste my time it's not going to change
So say what you want spit it out loud
Into my face
And I'll pay no attention
No attention
I'll pay no attention
I'll pay no attention
They're gonna tell you where to walk
When to smile and just what to say
They say have your own fun
Make your own mind
And don't make no waves
But if you got a handful of change
Don't throw it away it's gonna come
So say what you want, suck all my
Suck on my brain
And I'll pay no attention

If this isn't what you see
It doesn't make you blind
Yea, if this doesn't make you feel
It doesn't mean you've died
Where the river's high
Where the river's high
If you don't want to be seen
Well you don't have to hide
And if you don't want to believe
Well you don't have to try to feel alive,

If this doesn't make you smile
Yea, you don't have to cry
If this isn't making sense
Yea, it doesn't make it lies, oh

Kristi, tell me what I wanna hear
Oh
Kristi, tell me what I wanna hear
You never read without me
You won't sleep without me
You never try without me
You're only weak without me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Yeah
Kristi, show me what I wanna see
Yeah
Kristi, show me what I wanna see
You can't breathe without me
You're only cream without me
You can't walk without me

You'll never feel without me
Hey

Yeah

You won't smile without me
You'll never try without me
You'll only cry without me
You're gonna die without me
You're gonna die without me
You're gonna die without me
You're gonna die without me
You're gonna die without me I woke up in a burning house
I was nailed down to the floor
I looked outside my window
And there is going to be a
July snow
Show me
Show me
Show me the go
This guy once said
That the tire's only flat on the bottom
But that guy wound up dead
When his girlfriend's daddy shot him
Show me
Show me
Show me the go
The leaf that fell from the tree
The straw that broke the camel's back
My daddy spilled his cup in the river
And that was enough to break the dam
Show me
Show me
Show me the go
How can you buy or sell the sky
Or the warmth of the land it's strange to us
We don't own the freshness of the air
Or the sparkle of the water
How can you buy them from us
The white man doesn't understand our ways
For he's a stranger who comes in the night
And takes from the land just what he needs
Oh yeah
He treats his brothers like his enemies
When it's completed he moves on
He leaves his father's grave and his birthright
His birthright is forgotten
The air is precious to the red man
For all things share the same breath
The white man won't notice the air he breathes 
Like a man dying for many days
All right now
The whites must treat the beasts of his land
As his brothers not his enemies
Tell me what is man without the beasts
I'll bet he will die of loneliness
One thing we know that the white man will
We know our god is the same god
You may think you wish to own him
Own him as you wish to own our land
But he is the body of man
And the earth is precious to him
Continue to contaminate your bed
And you will suffocate in your waste
You can't go home boy, I swear you never can
You can walk a million miles and get nowhere
I got no where to go ever since I came back
Just filling in the lines for the holes, and the cracks
No one knows me
No one saves me
No one loves or hates me
I've been away for too long
This place has a sṗecial kind of falling apart
Like they put the whole thing together in the dark
No one knows where the edge of the knife is
And no one knows where intelligent life is
No one knows me
No one saves me
No one loves or hates me
Going straight
I only ever really wanted a break
I've been away for too long
No I never really wanted to stay
I've been away for too long I've been away for too long
I've been away for too long
Keyholes, through key holes
Widows through metals
I am still hiding everyone inside
Tank girls and fly guns and slippers and boots
On my way home
Going straight
I only ever really wanted a break
I've been away for too long
No I never really wanted to stay
I've been away.
Going straight
I only ever really wanted a break
I've been away for too long
No I never really wanted to stay
I've been away for too long
Though I can't put my hands in you I can feel you now
In the bones and the blood flowing needles on the ground
In the ether I sail to you floating on the fumes
Run aground on the shore for you simple wreckage
Taree walk out and raise the road to my tilted shadow
I only know I've made it home when I drown in you ghost light
Though I can't put a name on you I will cry it out
In my heart I will hold what my bloody hands have dropped
Run around on the floor for you simple wreckage
Taree walk out and raise the road to my tilted shadow
I only know I've made it home when I drown in you ghost light
Taree!
Taree!
Taree! I'm addicted to feeling,
Stealing love isn't stealing,
Can't you see that I understand your mind? I'm a walking believer,
I'm a ghost and a healer,
I'm the shape of the home inside your mind
Not looking for a brighter side,
Crooked steps will take me higher,
I don't care if you want to cry I'm a soldier for hire,
Killing all you admire,
And you live in the cloud but that will change
Not looking for a brighter side,
Crooked steps will take me higher,
I don't care if you want to cry
Blood raining down,
Cuts a deep, deep river,
And we're diving
And we're diving
By crooked steps,
Right behind you 
Right behind you
By crooked steps,
Right behind you 
Right behind you
By crooked steps,
Right behind you 
Right behind you
By crooked steps,
Right behind you 
Right behind you
By crooked steps,
Right behind you 
Right behind you
 I'm a walking believer,
I'm a ghost and a healer,
Can't you see that I understand your mind?
Can't you see that I understand your mind?
By crooked steps
Right behind you
By crooked steps
Right behind you
By crooked steps
Right behind you
By crooked steps
Right behind you
Hey you slaves go hang your owners
Draw your names among their ashes
Lay your children on their thrones
Gather round and fall right down
Here at sundown nothing is when
Everything is all right
Switch opens
Opening around and let's the garden rise
Switch is on

Hey you patients
Where's your surgeon?
Left you with your
Insides open
With your hearts out
On the table
Gather round and fall right down
Feel the air now
Stumbling and wander in the moonshine
Switch opens
Opening around and let's the garden rise
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on
Switch is on

Switch is on I had a dog he was a mix
he loved me like a
God
But I was just a kid
the kind mother likes
Now I'm big like the sky
and I'm down-sized inside
I'll put this all to rest
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy
I'm getting all depressed
I'm just a baby that looks like a boy I got my father's sense
and my big brother's pants
and I look like a man
and I feel like an ant just a speck on the ground
growing like a weed
a fleck of a seed I'll put my hand in flames
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy
feels like I'm born again
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy
I'm just a baby who looks like a boy and I'll keep hanging from your hair
and I'll keep playing in the sand
Just as long as I can
Kickstand, you got loose and I threw up
Yeah kickstand, you got the juice to fill my cup

My mother says that's the only life
So do it right

Every word I said is what I mean
Every word I said is what I mean
Everything I gave is what I need
Virgin eyes and dirty looks
On what I have and why I took
Counting all the hands I shook
Now I know why you've been shaking
Now I know why you've been shaking
Now I know why you've been shaking
Now I know why you've been shaking
So bleed your heart out
There's no more rides for free
Bleed your heart out
I said what's in it for me, what's in it for me
Everything I've held is what I've freed
Everything I've held is what I've freed
Everything I've shown is what I feel
Buying lies and stealing jokes
And laughing every time I choke
Biding all the time you took
Now I know why you've been taken

Now, now, now, now
Stretch the bones over my skin
Stretch the skin over my head
I'm going to the holy land
Stretch the marks over my eyes
Burn the candles deep inside
Yeah you know where I'm coming from
So give up to greed, you don't have to feed me
Give up to fate, you don't have to need me
So let it go, let it go, let it go, won't you let it
Drown me in you, drown me in you, drown me in you
Slip down the darkness to the mouth
Damn the water burn the wine
I'm going home for the last time
So throw it away, you don't have to take me
Make no mistake, I'm what you make me
So let it go, let it go, let it go, won't you let it
Drown me in you, drown me in you, drown me in you I see you turn around and burning down
The feeling starts to sink
I feel the hurt surround me
Please dissolve me
She's resolved to be
Heal my wounds without a trace
Seal my tomb without my face
I'm going to the lonely place
Give up to greed, you don't have to feed me
Give up to fate, you don't have to need me
So let it go, let it go, let it go, won't you let it
Drown me in you, drown me in you, drown me in you
Coin in every pocket
More mouths to fill
So weak in the land
Strong in the will 
need
I'll be your beast of burden
I'll be the seed
I bring you the healer
Feel your disease
I bring dirty water
And make it clean 
young
And you are the cure
I am the drug
And we settle for
A little bit more than everything
We're not elected,
But we will speak
We're not the chosen,
But we believe
And we settle for a little bit more than everything
Bullets, guns and missiles
A stone and a sling
A motherless country
Of thee I sing 
song
You are the tank and rockets
I am the bomb
I teach you a lesson
Sword for a pen
Reading turn the pages
A history of man 
look
You are tabula rasa
I am the book
And we settle for a little bit more than everything
We're not elected,
But we will speak
We're not the chosen,
But we believe
And we settle for
A little bit more than everything I'm a non-state actor
I'm a non-state actor
I'm a non-state
I'm a non-state actor
And we settle for a little bit more than everything
We're not elected but we will speak
We're not the chosen but we believe
And we settle for a little bit more than everything
A little bit more
A little bit more
A little bit more
White lemon days
Blue colored lines on your face
Devil in your best
Settling like death to the pain
Now loosening your grip
Feel the wheel slip from your hands
Walking the devil's dog
And carrying his groceries I fell on black days
Fell on black days
How would I know that this would be my fate
White lemon days
Love steal the schemes
Drive around like spaceships on bald tires
Burn the mother's milk
So another fog is in line
Now getting the devil's kiss
And wipe the mothers kiss from my face
Keep a stiff upper lip
Spitting on my past to the pain I fell on black days
Fell on black days
How would I know that this would be my fate
How would I know that this would be my fate
I fell on black days
I fell on black days
Fopped last night and the night before

Foppin is the brand new thing to do
Fopped so hard that I lost my shoe
I fopped so tough, they had to make some room, yeah
Break your leg, don't you fopp your back
Do your thing, don't you give no slack
Shake your hips and then you turn around
Well, first you fopp it up and then you fopp it down
Fopp me right, don't you fopp me wrong
We'll be here foppin all night long, baby

I just want to know what the heck is going on
Pavie, bummer baby
Shoot shoot
I got an idea of something we can do with a gun
Sink load and fire till the empire reaps what they've sown
Shoot shoot shoot till their minds are open
Shoot shoot till their eyes are closed
Push push push till we get some motion
Push push till the bombs explode, yeah I got an idea that we can do it all on our own
Nothing to worry regret must weigh a ton
Kick kick kick till the laws are broken
Kick kick till the boots are worn
Hit hit hit till the truth is spoken
Hit hit till the truth is born, yeah
Born I got an idea of something we can do with a gun
Can't touch me
Hands all over the
Eastern border
You know what I think we're falling
From composure
Hands all over
Western culture
Ruffling feathers and turning eagles into vultures
Yeah,
Into vultures
Got my arms around baby brother
Put your hands away
You're gonna kill your mother, gunna kill your mother
And I love her
Yeah, and I love her
Hands all over the coastal waters
The crew men thank her
Then lay down their oily blanket
Hands all over the inland forest
In a striking motion trees fall down
Like dying soldiers
Yeah, like dying soldiers
Got my arms around baby brother
Put your hands away
You're gonna kill your mother, gunna kill your mother
And I love her
Yeah, and I love her
Hands all over the peasant's daughter
She's our bride
She'll never make it out alive
Hands all over the words I utter
Change them into things you want to
Like balls of clay
Put your hands away
You're gonna kill your mother
And I love her
she loves me
Standing with my enemies
Hung on my horns
with haste and reverie
killing with charm only happy when you hurt
only deadly in a swarm
only healthy in the dirt
only empty in your arms I play, I'm sick and tame
drawing the hordes
I wait, and show the lame
the meaning of harm
the skulls beneath my feet
like feathers in sand
I graze among the graves
a feeling of peace only bending when you break
only feeding when you're cold
only healing when you ache
only feeling when you don't
Mountains all around altogether we stumble
Eleven million clowns every one with a razor out
And the smokes lies on the valley floor
And the blood dries while we spill some more once we were the end the end of the long road
Leading to the stars of the ever-invading crowds
And the smoke lies on the valley floor
And the blood dries while we spill
Endless summer needless space fill it all up with a void
Mountains all around altogether we stumble down
And the smoke lies on the valley floor
And the blood dries while we spill some more
Holy water on the brain and I? m losing sleep
Holy
Bible on the night stand next to me
As I'm raped by another monkey circus freak
Trying to take my indigence away from me, from me

To the voices
Telling all the mouths that they need to swallow
Too bad for me
It's the least that you can do
Don't be afraid
I would do the same for you
But I don't have any memory of the ever breathing
Til I'm born again I was thirsty
I remember that you gave me some water
I was angry
Everything you want me, low trouble
I was crying
I remember that you gave me your shoulder
Too bad for me
It's the least that you can do
Don't be afraid
I would do the same for you
But I don't have any memory of the ever breathing
Til I'm born again

Time is my friend till it ain't and runs out
And that is all that I have till it's gone
Try to build a home, bones of birds
Singing in the cold and fall to earth
Hey, sometimes she won't cry
When the smallest one is drowned
Too weak to survive probably. maybe
Try to look out through a hole in a bag
Circle above looking down, bird of prey
Try to build a home, bones of birds
Singing in the cold and fall to earth
Hey, sometimes she won't cry
When the smallest one is drowned
Too weak to survive
Too weak to survive
Too weak to survive probably. maybe
Try to build a home, bones of birds

Life
A thousand days ago
I was
Sinking in a hole
Try
To melt into all the walls
Now
I am here inside the cold
Here in the dark
Where no one stayed beside me
Now
A thousand days before
Again
Like the sun and moon at war
And
Give or take a thousand more
Here in the dark
Where no one stayed beside me
I'll be on my own side
You know where to find me
You know where to find me
Here in the dark
Where no one stayed beside me
I'll be on my own side
You know where to find me
You know where to find me
On
With a thousand needles
And
A tear to fill up everyone A thousand days before
I'll be on my own side
I'll be on my own side
I'll be on my own side

Lay here under bombast and gloom a parade of ghouls marches by
Headed down to nero's tomb raising flags and burning rights
Warm yourself by a
God-made fire pinocchio with spinning eyes
Laugh aloud under bomb-lit skies a victim's smile never lies
You have always lived you life like a joke with no time
What you gonna do about it until you get the punch line right?
On the cliff above stormy waves can't decide to climb or drown
Up is folly and down disgrace
Under thumbs over written the ladder is poison have to
Find a new way around
What you gonna do about it?
What you gonna do about it?
What you gonna do about it?
What you gonna do about it? A new damage comes

The one who searches and destroys
Honey gotta help me please
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby detonate for me
Look out honey, cause I'm using technology
Ain't got time to make no apology
Soul radiation in the dead of night
Love in the middle of a fire fight
Honey gotta strike me blind
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby penerate my mind
And I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin, searchin to destroy
And honey I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searchin, searchin to destroy
Forgotten boy, forgotten boy
Forgotten boy said hey forgotten boy
Every word I said is what I mean
Every word I said is what I mean
Everything I gave is what I need
Virgin eyes and dirty looks
On what I have and why I took
Counting all the hands I shook
Now I know why you've been shaking
Now I know why you've been shaking
So bleed your heart out
There's no more rides for free
Bleed your heart out
I said what's in it for me
Everything I've held is what I've freed
Everything I've held is what I've freed
Everything I've shown is what I feel
Buying lies and stealing jokes
And laughing every time I choke
Biding all the time you took
Now I know why you've been taken
Now I know why you've been taken
So bleed your heart out
There's no more rides for free
Bleed your heart out
I said what is in it for me
Let it swirl around you now and let it fall apart
Put it back again and find every piece but it's not the same
And you never can be sure just how it looked when you started
Turn around again now and do it all over and over
Like a doll from a bad dream
When it's gone worse dreams are born
Everybody in,
Sit down and keep on holding on
Pull your arms around black clouds drown and the rain is walking
Bodies in the ground by now down seven feet and rolling
Hanging on the tail of the sunrise til you can't let go
Like a doll from a bad dream
When it's gone worse dreams are born
Like a doll from a sad dream
When it's gone worse dreams are born
My momma socks it to me
Trying to tell me how to live
But I don't listen to her
Cause my head in like a sieve
My daddy kicked me out
Cause I wear my sister's clothes
He caught me in the bathroom
With a pair of panty hose
Check it!
My basketball coach
He done kicked me off the team
Wearing high heel sneakers
And dressing like a queen.
The world's coming to an end
And I don't fucking care
I just need my limo and orange hair
Check it!
Well people laugh at me
And I just think it's funny
Cause I'm a big rock star so, FUCK YOU!
FUCK YOU!
