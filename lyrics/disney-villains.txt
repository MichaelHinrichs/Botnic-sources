Poor unfortunate souls 
In pain, in need 
This one longing to be thinner 
That one wants to get the girl 
And do I help them? 
Yes, indeed 
Those poor unfortunate souls 
So sad, so true 
They come flocking to my cauldron 
Crying, "Spells, Ursula, please!" 
And I help them! 
Yes I do!
Now it's happened once or twice 
Someone couldn't pay the price 
And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals 
Yes I've had the odd complaint 
But on the whole I've been a saint 
To those poor unfortunate souls 
The men up there don't like a lot of blabber 
They think a girl who gossips is a bore! 
Yes on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word 
And after all dear, what is idle prattle for? 
Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation
True gentlemen avoid it when they can 
But they dote and swoon and fawn 
On a lady who's withdrawn 
It's she who holds her tongue who gets a man 
Come on you poor unfortunate soul 
Go ahead! 
Make your choice!
I'm a very busy woman and I haven't got all day 
It won't cost much 
Just your voice! 
You poor unfortunate soul 
It's sad but true 
If you want to cross the bridge, my sweet 
You've got the pay the toll 
Take a gulp and take a breath
And go ahead and sign the scroll 
Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got her, boys 
The boss is on a roll 
This poor unfortunate soul
Beluga sevruga 
Come winds of the Caspian Sea 
Larengix glaucitis Et max laryngitis 
La voce to me
Now, sing!

I know that your powers of retention 
Are as wet as a warthog's backside 
But thick as you are, pay attention 
My words are a matter of pride
It's clear from your vacant expressions 
The lights are not all on upstairs
But we're talking kings and successions 
Even you can't be caught unawares
So prepare for a chance of a lifetime 
Be prepared for sensational news 
A shining new era is tiptoeing nearer
And where do we feature?
Just listen to teacher 
I know it sounds sordid but you'll be rewarded 
When at last I am given my dues! 
And injustice deliciously squared 
Be prepared!
It's great that we'll soon be connected 
With a king who'll be all-time adored
Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected
To take certain duties on board 
The future is littered with prizes 
And though I'm the main addressee 
The point that I must emphasize is 
You won't get a sniff without me!
So prepare for the coup of the century 
Be prepared for the murkiest scam 
Meticulous planning, tenacity spanning 
Decades of denial is simply why I'll 
Be king undisputed, respected, saluted 
And seen for the wonder I am
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared! 
Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared 
Be prepared!

Prince Ali, yes it is he 
But not as you know him 
Read my lips and come to grips with reality
Yes, meet a blast from your past 
Whose lies were too good to last 
Say hello to your precious Prince Ali!
So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin 
Just a con, need I go on? 
Take it from me 
His personality flaws 
Give me adequate cause 
To send him packing on a one-way trip 
So his prospects take a terminal dip 
His assets frozen, the venue chosen 
Is the ends of the earth, whoopee! 
So long, ex-Prince Ali!

What a lovely little bride I'll make
My dear, I'll look divine
Things are working out according to my ultimate design
Soon I'll have that little mermaid
And the ocean will be mine!

From the brain that brought you the Big Ben Caper
The head that made headlines in every newspaper
And wonderous things like the Tower Bridge Job
That cunning display that made London a sob
Now comes the real Tour de Force
Tricky and wicked of course
My earlier crimes were fine for their times
But now that I'm at it again
An even grimmer plot has been simmering
In my great criminal brain
Even meaner? You mean it?
Worse than the widows and orphans you drowned?
You're the best of the worst around
Oh, Ratigan
Oh, Ratigan
The rest fall behind
To Ratigan
To Ratigan
The world's greatest criminal mind!
Thank you, thank you. But it hasn't all been champagne and caviar. I've had my share of adversity, thanks to that miserable, second rate detective, Basil of Baker Street.
For years, that insufferable pipsqueak has interfered with my plans.
I haven't had a moments piece of mind.
But, all that's in the past! This time, nothing, not even
Basil, can stand in my way! All will bow before me!
Oh, Ratigan
Oh, Ratigan
You're tops and that's that
To Ratigan
To Ratigan
To Ratigan the world's greatest rat! 
What was THAT?!
What did you call me?
Oh, he didn't mean it, Professor!
It was just a slip of the tongue!
I AM NOT A RAT!
'Course you're not! You're a mouse!
Yeah, that's right; right, a mouse!
Yeah, a big mouse!
SILENCE!  Oh, my dear Bartholomew, I'm afraid that you've gone and upset me.  
You know what happens when someone upsets me... 
Oh, Ratigan 
Oh, Ratigan 
You're the tops and that's that.  
Oh, dear  
To Ratigan 
To Ratigan
To Ratigan 
The world's greatest... 
Meow.
Oh, Felicia, my precious, my baby. Did Daddy's little honey-bunny enjoy her tasty treat?
I trust there shall be no further interruptions. And now, as you were singing?
Even louder
We'll shout it!
No one can doubt what we know you can do
You're more evil that even you
Oh, Ratigan
Oh, Ratigan
You're one of a kind
To Ratigan
To Ratigan
The world's greates criminal mind!!!


Goodbye so soon 
And isn't this a crime? 
We know by now that time knows how to fly
So here's goodbye so soon 
You'll find your separate way 
With time so short I'll say so long 
And go
So soon
Goodbye
You followed me, I followed you 
We were like each other's shadows for a while 
Now as you see, this game is through 
So although it hurts, I'll try to smile 
As I say
Goodbye so soon 
And isn't this a crime? 
We know by now that time knows how to fly
So here's goodbye so soon 
You'll find your separate way 
With time so short I'll say so long 
And go
So soon
Goodbye


Trust in me, just in me 
Shut your eyes and trust in me 
You can sleep safe and sound 
Knowing I am around
Slip into silent slumber 
Sail on a silver mist 
Slowly and surely your senses 
Will cease to resist
Just relax, be at rest 
Like a bird in a nest
Trust in me, just in me 
Shut your eyes and trust in me


Beata Maria 
You know I am a righteous man 
Of my virtue I am justly proud
Beata Maria 
You know I'm so much purer than 
The common, vulgar, weak, licentious crowd
Then tell me, Maria 
Why I see her dancing there 
Why her smoldering eyes still scorch my soul
I feel her, I see her 
The sun caught in her raven hair 
Is blazing in me out of all control
Like fire 
Hellfire 
This fire in my skin 
This burning Desire 
Is turning me to sin 
It's not my fault
I'm not to blame
Mea culpa
It is the gypsy girl T
he witch who sent this flame
It's not my fault
If in God's plan
Mea culpa
He made the devil so much 
Stronger than a man
Protect me, Maria 
Don't let this siren cast her spell 
Don't let her fire sear my flesh and bone 
Destroy Esmeralda 
And let her taste the fires of hell 
Or else let her be mine and mine alone 
Hellfire 
Dark fire 
Now gypsy, it's your turn 
Choose me or 
Your pyre 
Be mine or you will burn
God have mercy on her
God have mercy on me
But she will be mine 
Or she will burn!


Who does she think she is?
That girl has tangled with the wrong man!
Darn right.
No one says "no" to Gaston!
Dismissed! Rejected!
Publicly humiliated! Why, it's more than I can bear.
More beer?
What for? Nothing helps. I'm disgraced.
Who, you? Never! Gaston, you've got to pull yourself together.
Gosh it disturbs me to see you, Gaston
Looking so down in the dumps
Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston
Even when taking your lumps
There's no man in town as admired as you
You're everyone's favorite guy
Everyone's awed and inspired by you
And it's not very hard to see why
No one's slick as Gaston
No one's quick as Gaston
No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston's
For there's no man in town half as manly
Perfect, a pure paragon!
You can ask any Tom, Dick or Stanley
And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on
No one's been like Gaston
A king pin like Gaston
No one's got a swell cleft in his chin like Gaston
As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating!
My what a guy, that Gaston!
Give five "hurrahs!"
Give twelve "hip-hips!"
Gaston is the best
And the rest is all drips
No one fights like Gaston
Douses lights like Gaston
In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston!
For there's no one as burly and brawny
As you see I've got biceps to spare
Not a bit of him's scraggly or scrawny
That's right!
And every last inch of me's covered with hair
No one hits like Gaston
Matches wits like Gaston
In a spitting match nobody spits like Gaston
I'm espcially good at expectorating!
Ptoooie!
Ten points for Gaston!
When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs
Every morning to help me get large
And now that I'm grown I eat five dozen eggs
So I'm roughly the size of a barge!
Oh, ahhh, wow!
My what a guy, that Gaston!
No one shoots like Gaston
Makes those beauts like Gaston
Then goes tromping around wearing boots like Gaston
I use antlers in all of my decorating!
My what a guy,
Gaston!

It's time you were all introduced
To your ruler's executive staff
Perhaps not the kind you've been used to
But certainly game for a laugh
We'd like to assure you no fooling
Red meat is no longer our scene
And if now and then we're seen drooling
It's only an ancestor's gene!
So prepare for a glorious future!
Be prepared for the pride's golden age!
It's like any other
Who murdered a brother
If we don't spread rumors
He'll feed us and room us!
With friends in high places,
We hold all the aces!
So don't try and rattle my cage
Oh, imagine if anyone dared!
Be prepared!
Oh, imagine if anyone dared!
Be prepared!

Don't you disrespect me, little man
Don't you derogate or deride
You're in my world now, not your world
And I got friends on the other side
That's an echo, gentlemen
Just a little something we have here in Louisiana
A little parlor trick, don't worry
Sit down at my table
Put your minds at ease
If you relax it will enable me to do anything I please
I can read your future
I can change it 'round some, too
I'll look deep into your heart and soul
Make your wildest dreams come true
I got voodoo
I got hoodoo
I got things I ain't even tried
And I got friends on the other side
The cards, the cards, the cards will tell
The past, the present and the future as well
The cards, the cards, just take three
Take a little trip into your future with me
Now you, young man, are from across the sea
You come from two long lines of royalty
Your lifestyle's high
But your funds are low
You need to marry a little honey whose daddy got dough
Mom and dad cut you off, huh playboy?
Now y'all gotta get hitched, but hitchin' ties you down
You just wanna be free, hop from place to place
But freedom takes green
It's the green, it's the green, it's the green you need
And when I looked into your future it's the green that I see
On you, little man, I don't want to waste much time
You been pushed 'round all your life
You been pushed 'round by your mother and your sister and your brother
And if you was married
You'd be pushed 'round by your wife
But in your future, the you I see is exactly the man you always wanted to be
Shake my hand
Come on boys, won't you shake a poor sinner's hand?
Yes...
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Transformation central
Reformation central
Transmogrification central
Can you feel it?
You're changin'
You're changin'
You're changin', all right
I hope you're satisfied
But if you ain't
Don't blame me
You can blame my friends on the other side

The gold of Cortes
The jewels of Pizarro
Will seem like mere trinkets
By this time tomorrow
The gold we find here
Will dwarf them by far
Oh, with all ya got in ya, boys
Dig up Virginia, boys
Mine, boys, mine every mountain
And dig, boys, dig till ya drop
Grab a pick, boys
Quick, boys
Shove in a shovel
Uncover those lovely
Pebbles that sparkle and shine
It's gold and it's mine, mine, mine
Dig and dig and dig and diggety dig
Hey nonny nonny
Ho nonny nonny
Oh, how I love it!
Hey nonny nonny
Ho nonny nonny
Riches for cheap!
Hey nonny nonny
Ho nonny nonny
There'll be heaps of it
And I'll be on top of the heap!
My rivals back home
It's not that I'm bitter
But think how they'll squirm
When they see how I glitter
The ladies at court
Will be all a twitter
The king will reward me
He'll knight me, no, lord me!
It's mine, mine, mine
For the taking
It's mine, boys
Mine me that gold!
With those nuggets dug
It's glory they'll gimme
My dear friend, King Jimmy
Will probably build me a shrine
When all of the gold is mine
Dig and dig and dig and diggety dig
Keep on working, lads
Mine!
Don't be shirking, lads
Mine, boys, mine
Mine me that gold
Beautiful gold
Make this island my land
Make the mounds big, boys
I'd help you to dig, boys
But I've got this crick in me spine
This land we behold
This beauty untold
A man can be bold!
It all can be sold!
And the gold is
Mine, mine, mine!
And dig and dig and dig and diggety dig
Hey, nonny nonny
It's mine!

With only a touch
I have the power
Zim zabberim zim
To wither a flower
I find delight in the gruesome and grim
'Cause I'm the magnificent, marvelous, mad Madam Mim
I can be huge, fill the whole house
I can be tiny, small as a mouse
Black sorcery is my dish of tea
It comes easy to me
'Cause I'm the magnificent, marvelous, mad Madam Mim!
I can be beautiful, lovely and fair
Silvery voice, long purple hair
La la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la la
But it's only skin deep
For, zim zabberim zim
I am an ugly old creep
The magnificent, marvelous, mad, mad, mad, mad Madam Mim!

You want to go outside? Why, Rapunzel
Look at you, as fragile as a flower
Still a little sapling, just a sprout
You know why we stay up in this tower
That's right, to keep you safe and sound, dear
Guess I always knew this day was coming
Knew that soon you'd want to leave the nest
Soon, but not yet
Trust me, pet
Mother knows best
Mother knows best
Listen to your mother
It's a scary world out there
Mother knows best
One way or another
Something will go wrong, I swear
Ruffians, thugs, poison ivy, quicksand
Cannibals and snakes, the plague
Also large bugs, men with pointy teeth and...Stop, no more, you'll just upset me
Mother's right here
Mother will protect you
Darling, here's what I suggest
Skip the drama
Stay with mama
Mother knows best
Mother knows best
Take it from your mumsy
On your own, you won't survive
Sloppy, under-dressed
Immature, clumsy, please!
They'll eat you up alive
Gullible, naive
Positively grubby
Ditzy and a bit, well, hmm...vague
Plus, I believe
Gettin' kinda chubby
I'm just saying cause I wuv you
Mother understands
Mother's here to help you
All I have is one request
Don't forget it
You'll regret it
Mother knows best

Why would he like you, come on now, really
Look at you, you think that he's impressed?
Don't be a dummy
Come with mummy
Rapunzel knows best
Rapunzel's so mature now
Such a clever, grown-up miss
Rapunzel knows best
Fine, if you're so sure now
Go ahead then, give him this
This is why he's here
Don't let him deceive you
Give it to him, watch, you'll see
Trust me, my dear
That's how fast he'll leave you
I won't say I told you so
No, Rapunzel knows best
So if he's such a dreamboat
Go and put him to the test
If he's lying
Don't come crying
Mother knows best

Well, Tamatoa hasn't always been this glam
I was a drab little crab once
Now I know I can be happy as a clam
Because I'm beautiful, baby
Did your granny say listen to your heart
Be who you are on the inside
I need three words to tear her argument apart
Your granny lied!
I'd rather be...
Shiny
Like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck
Scrub the deck and make it look...
Shiny
I will sparkle like a wealthy woman's neck
Just a sec!
Don't you know
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb
They chase anything that glitters 
Oh, and here they come, come, come
To the brightest thing that glitters
Mmm, fish dinners
I just love free food
And you look like seafood

Well, well, well
Little Maui's having trouble with his look
You little semi-demi-mini-god
Ouch! What a terrible performance
Get the hook 
You don't swing it like you used to, man
Yet I have to give you credit for my start
And your tattoos on the outside
For just like you I made myself a work of art
I'll never hide; I can't, I'm too...
Shiny
Watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough
Strut my stuff; my stuff is so...
Shiny
Send your armies but they'll never be enough
My shell's too tough
Maui man, you can try, try, try
But you can't expect a demi-god
To beat a decapod 
You will die, die, die
Now it's time for me to take apart
Your aching heart
Far from the ones who abandoned you
Chasing the love of these humans
Who made you feel wanted
You tried to be tough
But your armour's just not hard enough
Maui
Now it's time to kick your...
Hiney
Ever seen someone so...
Shiny
Soak it in 'cause it's the last you'll ever see
C'est la vie, mon ami
I'm so...
Shiny
Now I eat you, so prepare your final plea
Just for me
You'll never be quite as...
Shiny
You wish you were nice and...
Shiny!

Hush, my little one; you must be exhausted
Sleep, my little Kovu
Let your dreams take wing
One day when you're big and strong
You will be a king
I've been exiled, persecuted
Left alone with no defense
When I think of what that brute did
I get a little tense
But I dream a dream so pretty
That I don't feel so depressed
'Cause it soothes my inner kitty
And it helps me get some rest
The sound of Simba's dying gasp
His daughter squealing in my grasp
His lioness' mournful cry
That's my lullaby
Now the past I've tried forgetting
And my foes I could forgive
Trouble is I know it's petty
But I hate to let them live
So you found yourself somebody
Who'll chase Simba up a tree
Oh, the battle may be bloody
But that kind of works for me
The melody of angry growls
A counterpoint of painful howls
A symphony of death, oh my!
That's my lullaby
Scar is gone, but Zira's still around
To love this little lad
Till he learns to be a killer
With a lust for being bad!
Sleep, ya little termite!
Uh, I mean, precious little thing!
One day when you're big and strong
You will be a king!
The pounding of the drums of war
The thrill of Kovu's mighty roar
The joy of vengeance!
Testify!
I can hear the cheering
Kovu! What a guy!
Payback time is nearing
And then our flag will fly
Against a blood-red sky
That's my lullaby!

Zazu, why am I not loved?
I am that rare and awesome thing
I'm every inch a king
Yet I feel a twinge of doubt
As I go walk about
Hey, boss!
When my name is whispered through the pride
Is this talk of love or regicide?
Reggie who?
Tell me I'm adored
Please tell me I'm adored
Hey, boss!
Oh, what is it?
We got a bone to pick with you
There's no food, no water, 
Yeah. It's dinnertime, and there ain't no
stinkin' entrées!
Oh, you and your petty complaints. You don't know what real hunger is. 
Day after day it gnaws at the very core of my being
I had that once. It was worms
No, no, no... it's like an itch... deep, persistent, profound...
That's it,  worms! When they get really bad all you gotta do is... hunker
down and scoot
Thanks for the tip. Ingrates! If it weren't for me you'd be beating off
buzzards for your next bite! 
Yeah, you're our savior, thanks a bunch
But how about some lunch?
It doesn't matter if it's fresh
I need a fix of flesh
My bones have moved to where they've never been
They are on the outside looking in
Are you blaming me?
Oh no, it's the lionesses
You are so adored
Oh, you are so adored
That's more like it
But what I'd give for one more hit
Of wildebeest kielbasa
Or maybe hornbill on the spit...
Oh, how I miss Mufasa
Mufasa?! Mufasa?! How dare you! I told you never to mention that name! 
Note taken. I shall never mention "M-m-m" again
Even in death, his shadow looms over me
There he is!
No! There he is!
And there!
Calm yourself, Sire, or you'll get another one of your splitting
headaches! 
I am perfectly fine!
I'm better than Mufasa was
I'm revered
I am reviled
I'm idolized
I am despised
I'm keeping calm
I'm going wild!
I tell myself I'm fine
Yes I am, no you're not
Yes I am, no you're not
I tell myself I'm fine
No you're not, yes I am, no you're not
Yes I am
No you're not
Yes, no, yes, no, who am I talking to...?
Oh, pull yourself together, Sire!
Oh, very well. Zazu? Zazu, Zazu, Zazu...?
Yes, Sire?
Nobody loved me, there's the rub, not even as a cub
What did my brother have that I don't have?
Do you want the short list or the long?
Whatever!
Well, he had adoring subjects... a loving family... a devoted queen... 
That's it! I need a queen!
A what?
A queen, man! A queen! Without a queen, what am I? A dead end, no line, no
descendants, no future. With a queen, I'll have cubs... Immortality will
be mine! Immortality will be mine!
Scar
Ah, Nala... Your timing couldn't have been more perfect. My how you've
grown
Scar, you have got to do something. We're being forced to overhunt
She's got those assets feminine
You're the king. Control the hyenas
I have to make her mine
You're destroying the Pridelands
Nobility in every gene
If we don't stop now.. Don't you see...
She has to be my queen
...there's still a chance for things to be all right again... 
Come, sweet Nala
It's written in the stars
What are you doing? Are you listening to me?
We'll create a host of little Scars
What are you talking about?
Tell me I'm adored
Get away from me
Tell me I'm adored
Oh, Nala... you know how I loathe violence... One way or another, you will
be mine
Never, Scar. Never!
You belong to me
You all belong to me

I must admit, your parlor tricks are amusing
I bet you've got a bunny under your hat 
Now here's your chance to get the best of me
Hope your hand is hot
C'mon, clown, let's see what you've got
You try to slam me with your hardest stuff
But your double whammy isn't up to snuff
I'll set the record straight
You're simply out of date
You're only second rate!
You think your cat's a meanie, but your tiger's tame
You've got a lot to learn about the genie game
So for your education I'll reiterate
You're only second rate!
Men cower at the power in my pinky
My thumb is number one on every list
But if you're not convinced that I'm invincible
Put me to the test
I'd love to lay this rivalry to rest
Go ahead and zap me with the big surprise
Snap me in a trap, cut me down to size
I'll make a great escape
It's just a piece of cake
You're only second rate!
You know, your hocus-pocus isn't tough enough
And your mumbo-jumbo doesn't measure up
Let me pontificate upon your sorry state
You're only second rate!
Zaba-caba-dabra!
Granny's gonna grab ya!
Alakazam-da-mus
And this thing's bigger than the both of us
So spare me your tremendous scare
You look horrendous in your underwear
And I can hardly wait to discombobulate
I'll send ya back and packing in a shipping crate
You'd make a better living with a spinning plate
You're only second rate!

Congratulations, bub, you've joined the club
And everybody here agrees
We got the finest blend of nearly-honest men
Welcome to the forty thieves!
A fraternity of thugs that you can trust
There's nothing up our eighty sleeves
Got lotsa grub to share
Pull up an easy chair
Welcome to the forty thieves!
Now you get to lie and cheat
Never have to brush your teeth
But we always aim to please
Care for one another
You'll never miss your mother
Oh, I love you guys
Schemin' up a scam
Out on the lam
Takin' whatever we please
And if you like to lurk
You're gonna love this work
Welcome to the forty thieves!
Welcome to the forty thieves!
Together we're the perfect team
Larceny is in the genes
Dare to share the family dream 
Live a life of leisure
Countin' all your treasure
As an honorary member of the gang
That no one alive ever leaves
Ya gotta snatch and sneak
Or else your future's bleak
We got a lifetime contract that you're bound to keep
You wanna save your skin
You better fit right in
Wel-wel-welcome to the
Wel-wel-welcome to the
Forty thieves!

I remember a time
When crime was sublime
There was plenty of loot in the lair
We'd plunder and pillage
And ransack a village
With nary a worry or care
Then along came this king
With his soft-hearted dream
But he ratted us out in the end
So rally the troops
We were meant to regroup
And return to our roots once again!
Are you in or out?
Gotta know without a doubt
I'm the one you need for a dirty deed
I'm the best, success is guaranteed
Are you men or mice?
Take a slice of my advice
You want a fearless leader, one that's strong and stout?
Better vote for me
Are you in or out?
We used to be smart, yes
Horrendously heartless
In a ravaging raid we were rough
We knew what we had
To be blissfully bad
Then Cassim brought this sensitive stuff
And we strayed from the path
Of our rigorous wrath
Now we're taking a bath in the dust
But we'll reclaim our winnings
Our humble beginnings
In turmoil and torture we trust
Are you in or out?
Double-crossers or devout?
Put your faith in me
Pretty soon you'll see
I'm the prince of generosity
Are you foe or friend?
Here's the path I recommend
You want a ride to fame?
I've got the fastest route
What's it gonna be?
Are you in or out?
We'll go robbing in all the right places
From Agrabah dunes to Paris
Imagine the fear on their faces
When we drop by for cookies and tea
Are you in or out?
If you're with me, give a shout
I'll lead you all the way
Into the glory days
We'll begin a life of crime that pays
Are you out or in?
Make your choice now, sink or swim
You can stick with me, or stay behind and pout
What's it gonna be?
Consider carefully
Are you in or out?

Gather 'round and I'll elucidate
What goes on outside when it gets late
Along about midnight the ghosts and banshees
They get together for their nightly jamboree
There's things with horns and saucer eyes
Some with fangs about this size
Some are fat and some are thin
And some don't even wear their skin
I'm telling you, brother, it's a frightful sight
To see what goes on Halloween night
When the spooks have a midnight jamboree
They break it up with fiendish glee
The ghosts are bad but the one that's cursed
Is the headless horseman; he's the worst
That's right, he's a fright on Halloween night
When he goes a joggin' 'cross the land
Holding his noggin in his hand
Demons take one look and groan
And they hit the road for parts unknown
Beware! Take care! He rides alone
And there's no spook like a spook that's spurned
They don't like him and he's really burned
He swears to the longest day he's dead
He'll show them that he can get a head
They say he's tired of his flaming top
He's got a yen to make a swap
So he rides one night each year
To find a head in the hollow here
He likes 'em little
He likes 'em big
Parted in the middle or a wig
Black or white or even red
The headless horseman needs a head
With a hip, hip and a clippity clop
He's out looking for a top to chop
So don't stop to figure out a plan
You can't reason with a headless man
Now if you doubt this tale is so
I met that spook just a year ago
Now I didn't stop for a second look
But made for the bridge that spans the brook
For once you've crossed that bridge, my friend
The ghost is through
His power ends
So when you're ridin' home tonight
Make for the bridge with all your might
He'll be down in the hollow there
He needs your head
Look out! Beware!
With a hip, hip and a clippity clop
He's out looking for a head to swap
So don't try to figure out a plan
You can't reason with a headless man

When daddy dear was floating on his deathbed
He divvied up the kingdom into two
I got his magic shell
And half the sea as well
His trident went to, 
You know who his trident went to, don't you, babies!
My reign, why, it was blissfully delicious!
And glamour, glitz and style were au courante
Did I use some black magic?
Well, oopsie, my bad!
Did I mutilate, maim and destroy?
Just a tad!
And for that, I get banished!
But me, I'm not mad
There's just one little thing that I want...
Just one teensy thing that I want
I want the good times back!
I want those grand ol' days!
I want the twisted nights
The sick delights
The wild soirees!
I want those trembling crowds of shellfish
Cracked and peeled for me to dine
Not because I'm mean or selfish, 
I only want what's mine!
I want disgusting wealth!
I want exquisite sin!
Want the entire sea
To worship me
On bended fin!
I want to greet my loving subjects
And then have them as a snack!
Remember those good times?
I want them back!
You'll bring the good times back!
Resume your wacky fun!
Restore the joyful charm
Of causing harm
To everyone!
I want to make the merfolk cower
Like they did in days of yore
Sure, it's sheer abuse of power, 
So?
Ain't that what power's for?
I want to taste their tears!
I want to hear their screams!
I want the special rush
You get from from crushing 
Hopes and dreams!
It's more than simply sentimental, 
It's an aphrodisiac!
Remember those good times!
Oh God, were they good times!
It's time for more good times!
Let's get 'em back!
If only I had a way
To make him pay
I'd set ol' Triton straight!
Poison?
Sure...
Blackmail?
Or...
His daughters...
Maybe, 
WAIT!
Why didn't we think of that before? His youngest!
The one with the beautiful voice?
Which she takes for granted! A woman doesn't know how precious her voice is until she's been silenced. Ha! Perhaps we could
teach them both a lesson...
I want the little girl!
Oh
And boys, I want her bad!
Ah?
I want her sitting here
To lure her dear
Devoted dad!
Mmm!
I want my goody-goody brother
To come rescue her, the sap!
And then one way or another, 
Surprise!
I'll spring the trap!
And get the good times back!
I mean with all the perks!
The trident, crown, the throne, 
All mine alone!
The whole damn works!
But most of all, I want ol' Triton
Pinned and wriggling on the rack
Then, fellas, it's my time!
And frankly, it's high time!
Those fabulous good times...
They're coming back!

Sweet child
Poor child.
So tragic
so misunderstood.
Dear child
sad child.
Life’s looking
shall we say
not good.
No.
Who will ease her woe’s and worry’s?
Who will help get her man?
Sweet child. Perhaps the Sea Witch can!
You can’t possibly mean aunt Ursula?
She knows your dreams
Father says her magic is evil
She’ll grant your prayer 
Please I have to go!
She’ll cast a charm
A tiny spell.
Why the alarm?
No one will tell
No one will care.
It’s your affair.
Sweet child
Dear child
Poor child.
Sad child.
We’ll bring you to her lair right now.
Bet in half a sec, 
your prince and you are reconciled.
Together
Forever
Take me to her!
Sweet child.

Ursula!
Brother darling! You're right on cue.
Give Ariel back to me!
Not on your life!
It so happens that your daughter signed a contract
No!
Even drew a little heart above the "i"
Is it binding? Goodness, yes!
Unbreakable, unless...
Unless?
There is a little somethin' we could try
Go on
Yes...
Perhaps we can arrange a sort of tradeoff
What?
Maybe swap your daughter's soul for, say, your own
Sing the scroll and set her free
Or else she comes with me
To suffer through eternity alone...
The mute little hatchling, drowning in her own sorrow, with no voice left to cry out your name... Well? I'm waiting.
It's not my soul you're after-it's my power.
Which would you rather be?
The King of the Sea... or a father to his little girl? Finally! The oceans belong to me!
And now you poor unfortunate soul!
Time's up! You're through!
Now the power of Poseidon 
Has been once again made whole
All the magic of the trident
And the shell in my control!
And now dark shall reign forever
Over ocean, sea and shoal!
Now see for yourselves how banishment feels!
You poor unfortunate souls!

With one wave of my hand
You know who's in command
I'm the quintessential queen of sorcery
I keep a potion in my purse
That's worse than any curse
No, you wouldn't want to mess with me
Take a barracuda's nose
And a dozen turtle toes
And the venom of a sea anemone
Eye of urchin, Crab of louie
Stir the goop until it's gooey
That's my favourite rancid recipe
No, you wouldn't want to mess with me

Make way, I'm in charge 
Your fate is looming large
It won't do you any good to flee
My concoctions never fail
So you'd better watch your tail
No, you wouldn't want to mess with me
When you think I'm on the brink of going under
I've a way of coming out on top
Oh my darling débutante
I always get just want I want
And I want this mucky luck to stop!
I'm the mistress of mystique
With a slender slim physique
I'm an idol in the sea of infamy
I admit I'm quite a catch 
But I've never met my match
So you shouldn't test the best
'Cause you couldn't stand the stress
No, you wouldn't want to mess with me

Go to sleep, my rotten little Ray.
And dream of dark and evil deeds!
For instance, wouldn’t it be fun to scatter ccallops with a glare?
Make the Grunion run around the Lionfish's lair?
Time to hit the sack, my brooding little brat.
For one day, you'll be feared from sea to sea.
When your worst you're at your best.
Close your eyes, you need your rest.
If you want to be just like me.
You're the most deplorable, horribly adorable
Manta that a daddy's ever seen!
Have a real bad night, give those beddy bugs a fright!
It's delightful when you're spiteful!
I'm so proud, I wanna scream!
Rest your wings, my precious little pup.
Relax in peaceful misery.
Drift away, and pretty sooner, you'll be terrorizing Tuna!
Just remember, being wicked is the key!
If you want to be just like me.

The quickest way to break your heart
Make you depressed and ill
Is to get tangled up inside
The side effects could kill
All passion is a waste of time
A deadly game pour vous
I am your friend, your cher ami
I wouldn't lie to you
If you must love someone, may I suggest
You love yourself! Just think it through
You'll never leave and you will find
You'll get more rest
You'll always feel as good as new
Your freedom is the most
Important thing, my friend
You must be strong, you mustn't bend
Don't talk for hours
Don't send flowers
Don't write poems
Don't sing songs and dance
Beneath the stars
That shine above
Don't fall in love
As soon as your heart rules your head
Your life is not your own
It's hell when someone's always there
It's bliss to be alone
And love of any kind is bad
A dog, a child, a cat
They take up so much precious time
Now where's the sense in that?
Love takes the wildest heart and makes it tame
If you're turned on, then just turn off
Emotions are a thing all great men overcame
Please, don't make this grande catastrophe
Don't get attached to anyone or anything
There's nothing worse than things that cling
You'll go to pot
You'll turn to drink
You'll never rest
You'll end up mad and
Looking like some
Poor demented dove
Don't fall in love
Don't fall in love

Things are not what they appear
As tonight will make quite clear
But what is real will be revealed
I can feel the moment's near
Things are never what they seem
That will be this evening's theme
Amusing sights for your delight
Perhaps a few to make you scream
You'll be surprised to see whose disguise
Is the cleverest one of the lot
After our show the whole world will know
Who's pretending to be what they're not
If a jester's grin or a dancer's spin
Should be pleasing, please say Yea!
Yea!
If a juggler's feat should be incomplete
He's the one to greet with Nay
Nay!
If the fools we see should look like you and me
Then before the night goes by
Ask why, why, why, why, why
Why?
Things are not what they appear
And the finest proof's right here
How I regret when we first met
I believed my own worst fear
Things are never what they seem
So in keeping with our theme
A change of hair, a dress to wear
And our nightmare's now a dream
Shoeless and wild
I saw this sweet child
As a danger to one and to all
Savage, I thought
What could Rolfe have brought
Now I see she's the belle of the ball
Things are never what they seem
He's right, he's right
Many don't say what they mean
He's right, he's right
A powdered face is just the place
To conceal an ugly scheme
Only one thing's really clear
Things are not what they appear

We are Siamese if you please
We are Siamese if you don't please
Now we looking over our new domicile
If we like we stay for maybe quite a while
Do you seeing that thing swimming round and round?
Maybe we could reaching in and make it drown
If we sneaking up upon it carefully
There will be a head for you, a tail for me
Do you hear what I hear?
A baby cry
Where we finding baby, there are milk nearby
If we look in baby buggy there could be
Plenty milk for you, and also some for me

Hi-diddle-dee-dee
An actor's life for me
A high silk hat and a silver cane
A watch of gold with a diamond chain
Hi-diddle-dee-day
An actor's life is gay
It's great to be a celebrity
An actor's life for me
Hi-diddle-dee-dee
An actor's life for me
A wax mustache and a beaver coat
A pony cart and a billy goat
Hi-diddle-dee-dum
An actor's life is fun
You wear your hair in a pompadour
You ride around in a coach and four
You stop and buy out a candy store
An actor's life for me!

First the Tower of London, arr!
The guards won't know what hit it
We swoop right down and take the crown
And the crown jewels with it
And when we fly to Paris
All the treasures I'll be grabbing
The Mona Lisa will look lovely
Hanging in me cabin
Hey, ho!
Imagine the places that we'll go
No one can stop us when we're so high
In the stratosphere
Hey, ho!
We'll be the freighter that plunders
Every one of the world's Seven Wonders
When we're up in the skies
For who can fight a frigate that flies
No one can fight a frigate that flies
Next we'll roam to Rome, me lads
And here's what I'll be stealing
I'll rob the Sistine Chapel
Of the Sistine Chapel's ceiling
And for all the folks in Egypt
It will be a dismal day
They'll be crying for their mummies
When we take their mummies away!
Hey, ho!
Imagine the places that we'll go
No one can stop us when we're so high
They will all cower in fear
Hey, ho!
From Delhi to Rio to Venice
There's no city that we will not menace
When we're up in the skies
For who can fight a frigate that flies
No one can fight a frigate that flies
Oh, how high we will be 

'Cause the blue fairy dust surely packs a mighty wallop 

Soon it will set us free 

From the chains of gravity
Then we'll hoist up the sail
And we'll set course for the sun
'Cause when you've got wings
No wicked deed cannot be done
And we owe it all to our great and glorious captain
Hey, ho!
Imagine the places that we'll go
No one can stop us when we're so high
Givin' a pirate cheer, arr!
Hey, ho!
We'll be the freighter that plunders
Every one of the world's Seven Wonders
When we're up in the skies
For who can fight a frigate that flies
Hey, ho!
There's not a town or a county
That will not yield its bounty up
When our ship draws near
Hey, ho!
There's not a city or village
That we will not plunder or pillage
When we're up in the skies
For who can fight a frigate that flies
And every nation
Will give a donation
When they see us sail the skies
In a frigate that flies!
Oi!

I am a pirate! I am a pirate!
Suave and dashing, sabers flashing,
bodies crashing, molars gnashing!
What a pleasure,
seeking treasure!
All the stealing, and concealing,
and the keeling, what a feeling!
Ah-ha-hah!
Take the sky by thunder!
Thu-under!
It is so wonderful to plunder!
Plu-under!
When a village needs a pillage,
and my pockets need a fillage
You know what I'm saying?
We are pirates!
Sky pirates!
Just think of all the people we can cheat!
What a great career
as a buccaneer!
It keeps us in the air and off the street!
Off the street!

Avast ye lads who be fainthearted!
We rule these skies uncharted
Cruel and vicious hearties we
Who sail upon the skies and not the sea!
'Tis I who lead this fearsome crew
With dagger, swagger, derring-do!
Handsome and fearsome and suave
He's the famous pirate captain
Don Karnage!
Hoist the flag and weigh the anchors
Circle the ship and pull to flank 'er
Hi-ho, he lives to plunder
It's true, I live to plunder
High up in the sky amidst a sea of storm and thunder
Now back to me, the main event
A pernicious, vicious raucous gent!
A frustratingly charming blaggart
He'll steal all of your treasure and your heart!
And now we dance! Ha!
He's Don Karnage!
That's me!
Wait, what?
It's Don Karnage!
Still me! A-ha-ha-ha
Pilfer the loot to fill our coffers
Been a pleasure to take it off ya!
Hey!
We'll put on a show
Then steal yer dough!
And then to the clouds, away we go
To the clouds, away I go
Yo-ho!
We are pirates!
Sky pirates!
We're as good at being bad as bad can get!
And the biggest prize
stands before our eyes
To capture captivating Cape Suzette!
Cape Suzette!
Cape Suzette!!
Cape Suzette!!!
