I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
and I want it now
Adventure seeker on an empty street,
Just an alley creeper, light on his feet
A young fighter screaming, with no time for doubt
With the pain and anger can't see a way out,
It ain't much I'm asking, I heard him say,
Gotta find me a future move out of my way,
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
and I want it now
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
and I want it now
Listen all you people, come gather round
I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground
Just give me what I know is mine,
People do you hear me, just give me the sign,
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth,
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
and I want it now
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
and I want it now I'm a man with a one track mind,
So much to do in one life time people do you hear me
Not a man for compromise and where's and why's and living lies
So I'm living it all, yes I'm living it all,
And I'm giving it all, and I'm giving it all,
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth,
Here's to the future, hear the cry of youth,
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
and I want it now
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
and I want it now 
And I want it
now.
and I want it
and I want it 

It's so easy but I can't do it
So risky
But I gotta chance it
It's so funny
There's nothing to laugh about
My money
That's all you want to talk about
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm not fool
It's in the lap of the
Gods
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool
No beginning there's no ending
There's no meaning
In my pretending
Believe me life goes on and on and on
Forgive me when I ask you
Where do I belong
You say
I can't set you free from me
But that's not true
It's in the lap of the
Gods
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the
Gods
Wo wo la la la wo
Wo wo la la
Wah wah ooh
But that's not true
It's in the lap of the
Gods
Is this the real life, is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide no escape from reality
Open your eyes look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows
Doesn't really matter to me, to me
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh anyway the wind blows I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all I see a little silhouette of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
Gallileo,
Gallileo,
Gallileo,
Gallileo,
Gallileo
Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go will you let me go
Bismillah, no we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah, we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah, we will not let you go, let me go
Will not let you go, let me go never
Never let you go, let me go
Never let me go, ooh
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me, for me
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby, can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah nothing really matters
Anyone can see nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Anyway the wind blows
Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world I'll turn it inside out
And floating around in ecstasy
So don't stop me now, don't stop me
Cause I'm having a good time, having a good time I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky like a tiger
Defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by like
Lady
Godiva

Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look at yourself
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief,
Lord!
Somebody, somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love? I work hard he works hard every day of my life
I work till I ache in my bones
At the end at the end of the day
I take home my hard earned pay all on my own
I get down down on my knees knees
And I start to pray
Till the tears run down from my eyes
Lord somebody, somebody
Please can anybody find me somebody to love? 
He works hard
Everyday everyday I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm going crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe in
Lord, somebody, somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Can anybody find me someone to love?
Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat you just keep losing and losing
I'm OK, I'm alright he's alright, he's alright
I ain't gonna face no defeat I just gotta get out of this prison cell
One day someday I'm gonna be free,
Lord!
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love

Pressure, pushing down on me,
pressing down on you, no man ask for.
Under pressure that burns a building down,
splits a family in two, puts people on streets.
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about.
Watching some good friends screaming, let me out.
Tomorrow gets me higher.
Pressure on people, people on streets.
Chippin around, kick my brains around the floor.
These are the days, it never rains but it pours.
People on streets.
People on streets.
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about.
Watching some good friends screaming, let me out.
Tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high!
Pressure on people, people on streets.
Turned away from it all like a blind man.
Sat on a fence, but it don't work.
Keep comin up with love, but it's so slashed and torn.
Why, why, why?
Love love, love, love, love.
Insanity laughs, under pressure we're cracking.
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love,
give love, give love, give love, give love, give love.
Cause love's such an old fashioned word,
and love dares you to care for the people on the
edge of the night, and love dares you to
change our way of caring about ourselves.
This is our last dance.
This is ourselves.
Under pressure.
Under pressure.
Pressure.

You wanna try.
Let's go!
Steve walks warily down the street
With his brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready, hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you when you're gone?
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, look out
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
Hey, another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Shoot out
There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him
You can treat him bad and leave him
When he's down
But I'm ready, yes, I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
Shoot out
Empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score
On and on!
Does anybody know what we are looking for?
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line!
Does anybody want to take it anymore?
The show must go on!
The show must go on!
Yeah!
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on!
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on.
Does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning
I must be warmer now I'll soon be turning, round the corner now.
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free!
The show must go on!
The show must go on!
Yeah, yeah!
Ooh!
Inside my heart is breaking!
My make-up may be flaking.
But my smile, still, stays on!
Yeah! oh oh oh
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday, will grow but never die
I can fly, my friends!
The show must go on!
Yeah!
The show must go on! I'll face it with a grin!
I'm never giving in!
On with the show!
I'll top the bill!
I'll overkill!
I have to find the will to carry on!
On with the
On with the show!
The show must go on
This thing called love
I just can't handle it
This thing called love
I must get round to it
I ain't ready
Crazy little thing called love
This thing, this thing
Called love, called love
It cries like a baby
In a cradle all night
It swings,
It jives
It shakes all over like a jelly fish
I kinda like it
Crazy little thing called love
There goes my baby
She knows how to rock n roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
Get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready
Crazy little thing called love I gotta be cool, relax, get hip
Get on my tracks
Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motor bike
Until I'm ready ready

Crazy little thing called love
Crazy little thing called love
One, two, three, four
While the sun hangs in the sky and the desert has sand
While the waves crash in the sea and meet the land
While there's a wind and the stars and the rainbow
Till the mountains crumble into the plain
Yes, we'll keep on tryin
Tread that fine line
Yes, we'll keep on tryin
Just machine at the time
While we live according to race, colour or creed
While we rule by blind madness and pure greed
Our lives dictated by tradition, superstition, false religion
Through the aeons, and on and on
Yes, we'll keep on tryin
Trad my far life
Yes, we'll keep on tryin
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
Through the sorrow, all through our splendour
Don't take offence at my innuendo
Do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do
You can be anything you want to be
Just turn yourself into anything you think that you could ever be
Be free with your tempo, be free, be free
Surrender your ego, be free, be free to yourself!
If there's a
God or any kind of justice under the sky
If there's a point, if there's a reason to live or die
If there's an answer to the questions we feel bound to ask
Show yourself destroy our fears, release your mask
Yes, we'll keep on tryin
Tread my far life
Yes, we'll keep on tryin
And forever will be!
Keep on tryin
Just keep on tryin
Till the end of time
Till the end of time

In rain or shine

Whenever this world is cruel to me

My need is such I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell
Oh yes I'm
The
Great
Pretender ooh ooh
Adrift in a world of my own ooh ooh
I play the game but to my real shame
You've left me to dream all alone
Too real is this feeling of make believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal
Ooh
Ooh yes I'm
The
Great
Pretender ooh ooh
Just laughing and gay like a clown ooh ooh
I seem to be what I'm not you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around

The
Great
Pretender
Just laughing and gay like a clown ooh ooh
I seem to be what I'm not you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're
Pretending that you're still around
Sometimes I get the feelin
I was back in the old days long ago
When we were kids when we were young
Things seemed so perfect, you know
The days were endless we were crazy we were young
The sun was always shinin
we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately
I just don't know
The rest of my life's been just a show
Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true
When I look and I find I still love you
You can't turn back the clock you can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use in sitting and thinkin on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately
I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow
Cos these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now but some things remain
When I look and I find no change
Those were the days of our lives, yeah
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true
When I look and I find
I still love you
I still love you I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home
And I've been facing this alone for much too long
Oh, I feel like no-one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind
I've been looking back to find where I went wrong
Too much love will kill you
If you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover and the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster cos you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you every time
I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine
Now all I ever do is bring you down, oooh
How would it be if you were standing in my shoes
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose
No there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I'm bound to lose, oh yeah
Too much love will kill you
Just as sure as none at all
It'll drain the power that's in you
Make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy
You're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you every time
Yeah too much love will kill you
It'll make your life a lie
Yes too much love will kill you
And you won't understand why
You'd give your life you'd sell your soul
But here it comes again
Too much love will kill you
In the end.
In the end.

You're wondering who I am
Secret, secret, I've got a secret
Machine or mannequin
Secret, secret, I've got a secret
With parts made in
Japan
Secret, secret, I've got a secret
I am the modren man I've got a secret, I've been hiding under my skin
My heart is human, my blood is boiling
My brain I.B.M. so if you see me
Acting strangely, don't be surprised I'm just a man who needed someone
And somewhere to hide
To keep me alive, just keep me alive
Somewhere to hide to keep me alive I'm not a robot without emotions
I'm not what you see
I've come to help you
With your problems, so we can be free
I'm not a hero, I'm not a saviour
Forget what you know I'm just a man whose circumstances
Went beyond his control
Beyond my control, we all need control
I need control, we all need control I am the modren man
Secret, secret I've got a secret
Who hides behind a mask
Secret, secret, I've got a secret
So no one else can see
Secret, secret, I've got a secret
My true identity

Thank you very much,
Mr. Roboto
For doing the jobs that nobody wants to
And thank you very much,
Mr. Roboto
For helping me escape
Just when I needed to
Thank you, thank you, thank you
I want to thank you
Please, thank you, oh
The problem's plain to see
Too much technology
Machines to save our lives
Machines, de-humanize
The time has come at last
Secret, secret, I've got a secret
To throw away this mask
Secret, secret, I've got a secret
Now everyone can see
Secret, secret, I've got a secret
My true identity, I'm
Kilroy,
Kilroy,
Kilroy,
Kilroy
One man, one goal
One mission
One heart, one soul
Just one solution
One flash of light
One
God, one vision
One flesh, one bone
One true religion
One voice, one hope
One real decision
Gimme one vision
No wrong, no right
I'm gonna tell you there's no black and no white
No blood, no stain
All we need is one world wide vision
One flesh one bone
One true religion
One race one hope
One real decision I had a dream when I was young
A dream of sweet illusion
A glimpse of hope and unity
And visions of one sweet union
But a cold wind blows
And a dark rain falls
And in my heart it shows
Look what they've done to my dreams
So give me your hands
Give me your hearts
I'm ready
There's only one direction
One world, one nation
One vision
No hate, no fight
Just excitation
All through the night
It's a celebration
One vision
One flesh, one bone
One true religion
One voice, one hope
One real decision
Gimme one light
Gimme one hope
Just gimme
One man, one man
One bar, one night
One day hey hey
Just gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme
Fried chicken
Ooh oh oh ooh
Ooh oh oh oh oh oooh, take it, take it all away
Ooh oh oh ooh, ooh ooh, take my breath away, oooh
Oh oh oh ooh, oooh, you ooh ooh ooh take my breath away
Look into my eyes and you'll see
I am the only one
You've captured my love
Stolen my heart
Changed my life
Everytime you make a move
You destroy my mind
And the way you touch
I lose control and shiver deep inside
You take my breath away
You can reduce me to tears
With a single sigh please don't cry anymore
Every breath that you take
Any sound that you make
Is a whisper in my ear I could give up all my life for just one kiss
I would surely die
If you dismiss me from your love
You take my breath away
So please don't go
Don't leave me here all by myself
I get ever so lonely from time to time
I will find you
Anywhere you go
I'll be right behind you oooh, oooh, oooh
Right until the ends of the earth ahhhhh
I'll get no sleep till I find you
To tell you that you just
Take my breath away I will find you
Anywhere you go, oooh, oooh, oooh
Right until the ends of the earth ahhhhh
I'll get no sleep till I find you
To tell you when I've found you
I love you
Take my breath, take my breath, take my breath
Take my breath, take my breath, take my breath
Take my breath, take my breath, take my breath
Take my breath, take my breath, take my breath
Take my breath, take my breath, take my breath
Take my breath, take my breath, take my breath
Away I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
and I want it now
Adventure seeker on an empty street,
Just an alley creeper, light on his feet
A young fighter screaming, with no time for doubt
With the pain and anger can't see a way out,
It ain't much I'm asking, I heard him say,
Gotta find me a future move out of my way,
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
and I want it now
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
and I want it now
Listen all you people, come gather round
I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground
Just give me what I know is mine,
People do you hear me, just give me the sign,
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth,
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
and I want it now
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
and I want it now I'm a man with a one track mind,
So much to do in one life time people do you hear me
Not a man for compromise and where's and why's and living lies
So I'm living it all, yes I'm living it all,
And I'm giving it all, and I'm giving it all,
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth,
Here's to the future, hear the cry of youth,
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
and I want it now
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all
and I want it now 
And I want it
now.
and I want it
and I want it 

There's no time for us
There's no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams, yet slips away from us
Who wants to live forever
Who wants to live forever
Ooh
There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us
Who wants to live forever
Who wants to live forever
Ooh
Who dares to love forever
Ooh
When love must die
But touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your fingertips
And we can have forever
And we can love forever
Forever is hour today
Who wants to live forever
Who wants to live forever
Forever is hour today
Who waits forever anyway
Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy
I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come
Easy go
Little high
Little low
Any way the wind blows
Doesn't really matter to me
To me
Mama
Just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama
Life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late
My time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody
I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh any way the wind blows
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all 
Ooh, ooh I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche,
Scaramouche, will you do the
Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning
Very, very frightening me 
Galileo
Galileo
Galileo
Galileo
Galileo
Figaro
Magnifico oh oh oh oh 
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah!
No, we will not let you go 
Let him go!
Bismillah!
We will not let you go 
Let him go!
Bismillah!
We will not let you go 
Let me go!
Will not let you go 
Let me go!
Never let you go never, never, never, never
Let me go oh oh oh oh
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, mama mia, mama mia
Mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me
For me
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby
Can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out
Just gotta get right outta here 
Ohh,
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds, invaded by
Mars
You made em laugh, you made em cry
You made us feel like we could fly
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio
All we hear is

Radio, someone still loves you!
We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around cos we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

Dale:
My
God we're moving
Zarkov: For God's sake, strap yourselves down
Oh how wrong can you be?
Oh to fall in love
Was my very first mistake
How was I to know
I was far too much in love too see?
Oh jealousy look at me now
Jealousy you got me somehow
You gave me no warning
Took me by surprise
Jealousy you led me on
You couldn't lose you couldn't fail
You had suspicion on my trail
How how how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy
Oh how strong can you be
With matters of the heart?
Life is much too short
To while away with tears
If only you could see
Just what you do to me
Oh jealousy you tripped me up
Jealousy you brought me down
You bring me sorrow you cause me pain
Jealousy when will you let go?
Gotta hold of my possessive mind
Turned me into a jealous guy
How how how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy
But now it matters not
If I should live or die
Cause I'm only left with my own jealousy. A hand above the water
An angel reaching for the sky
Is it raining in
Heaven
Do you want us to cry?
And everywhere the broken hearted
On every lonely avenue
No one could reach them
No one but you
One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flying too close to the sun
And life goes on
Without you
Another tricky situation
I get the drownin in the
Blues
And I find myself thinkin
Well, what would you do?
Yes, it was such an operation
Forever paying every due
Hell, you made a sensation
You found a way through
One by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin too close to the sun
We'll remember
Forever
And now the party must be over
I guess we'll never understand
The sense of your leaving
Was in the way it was planned?
And so we grace another table
And raise our glasses one more time
There's a face at the window
And I ain't never, never sayin goodbye
And it's one by one
Only the good die young
They're only flyin too close to the sun
Cryin for nothing
Cryin for no one
No one but you
It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
A kind of magic
One dream, one soul, one prize, one goal
One golden glance of what should be it's a kind of magic
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day it's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time it's a kind of magic
The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
Is this a kind of magic? it's a kind of magic
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done
This flame that burns inside of me I'm hearing secret harmonies it's a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be, will soon be done
This is this is a kind a kind of magic yeah
There can be only one one one one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done done
Magic it's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
Magic magic magic magic
Ha ha ha haa, it's magic
Ha haa
Yeah yeah
Wooh
It's a kind of magic I don't want my freedom
There's no reason for living with a broken heart
This is a tricky situation
I've only got myself to blame
It's just a simple fact of life
It can happen to any one
You win, you lose
It's a chance you have to take with love
Yeah, I fell in love
But now you say it's over and I'm falling apart
It's a hard life to be true lovers together
To love and live forever in each others hearts
It's a long hard fight to learn to care for each other
To trust in one another right from the start
When you're in love I try and mend the broken pieces
I try to fight back the tears
They say it's just a state of mind
But it happens to everyone
How it hurts deep inside
When your love has cut you down to size
Life is tough on your own
Now I'm waiting for something to fall from the skies
I'm waiting for love
Yes, it's a hard life, two lovers together
To love and live forever in each others hearts
It's a long hard fight to learn to care for each other
To trust in one another right from the start
When you're in love
Yes, it's a hard life in a world that's filled with sorrow
There are people searching for love in every way
It's a long hard fight but I'll always live for tomorrow
I'll look back at myself and say I did it for love
Yes, I did it for love
For love
I did it for love!
Another red letter day
So the pound has dropped and the children are created
The other half run away
Taking all the cash and leaving you with the lumber
Got a pain in the chest
Doctors on strike, what you need is a rest.
It's not easy love, but you've got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention.
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand cos friends will be friends
Right till the end.
Now it's a beautiful day
The postman delivered a letter from your lover
Only a phone call away
You tried to track him down but somebody stole his number
As a matter of fact
You're getting used to life without him in your way.
It's so easy now, cos you got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention.
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand cos friends will be friends
Right till the end.
It's so easy now, cos you got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention.
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand cos friends will be friends
Right till the end.
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention.
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost.
Hold out your hand cos right till the end
Friends will be friends.
Yeah, yeah
When I'm gone
Don't stop to wonder if I ever think of you
The same moon shines
The same wind blows
For both of us, and time is but a paper moon... be not gone
Though I'm gone
It's just as though I hold the flower that touches you
A new life grows
The blossom knows
There's no one else could warm my heart as much as you... be not gone
Let us cling together as the years go by
Oh my love, my love
In the quiet of the night
Let our candle always burn
Let us never lose the lessons we have learned
Teo

Hear my song
Still think of me the way you've come to think of me
The nights grow long
But dreams live on
Just close your pretty eyes and you can be with me... dream on
When I'm gone
They'd say we're all fools and we don't understand
Oh be strong
Don't turn your heart
You're all
We're all
For all
For always..
In the year of 39 assembled here the volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
The sweetest sight ever seen
And the night followed day
And the story tellers say
That the score brave souls inside
Um, for many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Never looked back, never feared, never cried
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew
In the year of 39 came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavenly weigh
For the earth is old and grey, little darling went away
But my love this cannot be
For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year
Your mothers eyes from your eyes cry to me
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
All your letters in the sand
Cannot heal me like your hand
For my life still ahead, pity me
Here we stand or here we fall
History won't care at all
Make the bed light the light
Lady mercy won't be home tonight yeah
You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We're just waiting
For the
Hammer
To
Fall
Oh every night and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face the western way
Build your muscles as your body decays yeah
Toe your line and play their game yeah
Let the anaesthetic cover it all
Till one day they call your name
You know it's time for the
Hammer
To
Fall
Rich or poor or famous
For your truth it's all the same oh no oh no
Lock your door the rain is pouring
Through your window pane oh no
Baby now your struggle's all in vain
For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder louder
What the hell we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
While your waiting for the hammer to

Tonight I think i'm going back
to the things i learnt so well in my youth
i think i'm returning to those days when i was young enough to know the truth
now there are no games
to only pass the time
no more colouring books no christmas bells to chime
but thinking young and growing older is no sin and i can't play the game of life to win
i can recall a time
when i wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend
and now i think i've got a lot more than just my toys to lend
now there's more to do
than watch my sailboat glide
and every day can be my magic carpet ride
and i can play hide and seek with my fears and live my days instead of counting my years
then everyone debates
the true reality
i'd rather see the world
the way it used to be
a little bit of freedom's all we lack
so catch me if you can
i'm going back
Sammy was low,
just watching the show,
over and over again.
He knew it was time,
he'd made up his mind,
to leave his dead life behind.
His boss said to him
boy, you'd better begin
to get those crazy notions
right out of your head
Sammy who do you think that you are?
You should have been sweeping
up the emerald bar.
Spread
Your
Wings and fly away,
fly away, far away.
Spread your little wings and fly away
fly away, far away.
Pull yourself together,
cause you know you should do better,
that's because you're a free man.
He spends his evenings alone,
in his hotel room.
Keeping his thoughts to himself,
he'd be leaving soon.
Wishing he was miles and miles away,
nothing in this world, nothing,
would make him stay.
Since he was small,
had no luck at all,
nothing came easy to him.
Now it was time,
he'd made up his mind,
this could be my last chance
His boss said to him
now listen boy, you're always dreaming,
you got no real ambition,
you won't get worried for.
Sammy, boy don't you know who you are?
why can't you be happy,
at the emerald bar? 
So honey spread you wings and fly away,
fly away, far away.

Time waits for nobody
Time waits for nobody
We all must plan our hopes together
Or we'll have no more future at all
Time waits for nobody
We might as well be deaf and dumb and blind
I know that sounds unkind
But it seems to me we've not listened to
Or spoken about it at all
The fact that time is running out for us all
Time waits for nobody
Time waits for no-one
We've got to build this world together
Or we'll have no more future at all
Because time, it waits for nobody
You don't need me to tell you what's gone wrong gone wrong gone wrong
You know what's going on
But it seems to me we've not cared enough
Or confided in each other at all confided in each other at all
It seems that we've all got our backs against the wall 
Time
Time waits for nobody
Time waits for no-one
We've got to trust in one another
Or there'll be no more future at all
Time
Yeah,
Time waits for nobody
No no,
Time don't wait for no-one
Let's learn to be friends with one another
Or there'll be no more future at all
Time time time time waits for nobody waits for nobody
Time time time time waits for nobody at all
Time waits for nobody, yeah
Time don't wait, waits for no-one
Let us free this world for ever
And build a brand new future for us all
Time waits for nobody nobody nobody
For no one

Oh oh people of the earth
Listen to the warning
The
Seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hands on the multitude there A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice cold hearts of charity bare
I watched as fear took the old men's gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves
I see no day, I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal
Oh oh people of the earth
Listen to the warning
The prophet he said
For soon the cold of night will fall
Summoned by your own hand
Oh oh children of the land
Quicken to the new life
Take my hand
Ooh, fly and find the new green bough
Return like the white dove
He told of death as a bone white haze
Taking the lost and the unloved babe
Late too late all the wretches run
These kings of beasts now counting their days
From mother's love is the son estranged
Married his own his precious gain
The earth will shake in two will break
And death all around will be your dowry
Oh oh people of the earth
Listen to the warning the seer he said
For those who hear and mark my words
Listen to the good plan
Oh oh oh oh, and two by two my human zoo
They'll be
Running for to come
Running for to come
Out of the rain
Oh, flee for your life
Who heed me not, let all your treasure make you
Oh, fear for your life
Deceive you not the fires of hell will take you
Should death await you
Oh, oh, people can you hear me oh, oh, people can you hear me
Oh, oh, people can you hear me

One dance whose steps I never could learn
It's called
The
Wedding
March
The grace that it takes, the grace you deserve,
Require a lighter touch
I know you love dancing.
Oh, I know that you love dancing so much
I know you love dancing.
Music's a wild thing with mischief to prove
I can't adjust to the way that you move
Music's a wild thing whatever the groove
Some music isn't for dancing
One dance whose steps I never could learn
It's called
The
Wedding
March
The grace that it takes, the balance and poise,
I still find a mystery
I know you love dancing.
So, I know that you'd hate dancing with me
I know you love dancing.
So, I know that you'd hate dancing with me

Alright
Take off
I was told a million times
Of all the troubles in my way
Tried to grow a little wiser
Little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors
In a shopping alley way
But I never saw my face
In any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you
Be a super star
But I tell you just be satisfied
Stay right where you are
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and money
To keep me satisfied
Well I've loved a million women
In a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners
Brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need
To feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times
Of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying
And get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Same as when I started
Keep yourself alive, come on
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and money
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and money
Honey, you'll survive
Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Come on, keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Happy little day
Jimmy went away
Met his little
Jenny on a
public holiday
A happy pair they made
so decorously laid
Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade
It's so good to know there's still a little
magic in the air
I'll
weave my spell
Jenny will you stay
tarry with me pray
Nothing ere need come between us tell me love, what do you say
Oh no I must away to my
Mum in disarray
If my mother should discover how I spent my holiday
It would be of small avail to talk of
magic in the air
I'll say farewell
O
Rock of
Ages
do not crumble
love is breathing still
O
Lady
Moon shine down
a little people magic if you will
Jenny pines away
writes a letter everyday
We must ever be together
nothing can my love erase
Oh no I'm compromised
I must apologize
If my lady should discover
how I spent my holidays.
ooohh ooo ooo
It's so easy but I can't do it
So risky
But I gotta chance it
It's so funny
There's nothing to laugh about
My money
That's all you want to talk about
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm not fool
It's in the lap of the
Gods
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool
No beginning there's no ending
There's no meaning
In my pretending
Believe me life goes on and on and on
Forgive me when I ask you
Where do I belong
You say
I can't set you free from me
But that's not true
It's in the lap of the
Gods
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the
Gods
Wo wo la la la wo
Wo wo la la
Wah wah ooh
But that's not true
It's in the lap of the
Gods
Lately, I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through, wow
Are you reaching out for me
Like I'm reaching out for you?
When I'm gone
No need to wonder if I ever think of you
The same moon shines
The same wind blows
For both of us, and time is but a paper moon.
Be not gone
Though I'm gone
It's just as though I hold the flower that touches you
A new life grows
The blossom knows
There's no one else could warm my heart as much as you.
Be not gone
Let us cling together as the years go by
Oh my love, my love
In the quiet of the night
Let our candle always burn
Let us never lose the lessons we have learned

But dreams live on
Just close your pretty eyes and you can be with me.

For always
Let us cling together as the years go by
Oh my love, my love
In the quiet of the night
Let our candle always burn
Let us never lose the lessons we have learned

Words and music by roger taylor
It's the sad eyed goodbye
yesterday's moments i remember
it's the bleak street, week kneed partings i recall
it's the mistier mists the hazier days
the brighter sun and the easier lays
there's all the more reason for laughing and crying
when you're younger and life isn't to hard at all
It's the fantastic drowse
of the afternoon sundays
that bored you to rages of tears
the unending pleadings
to waste all your good times
in thoughts of your middle-aged years
it's the vertical hold all the things that you're told
for the everyday hero it all turns to zero
and there's all the more reason
for living or dying when you're young
and your troubles are all very small
Out here on the street we'd gather and meet
and scuff up the sidewalk
with endlessly restless feet
half on the time we'd broaden our minds
more in the pool hall
than we did in the school hall
with the down town chewing gum bums
watching the night life the lights and the fun
Never wanted to be the boy next door
always thought i'd be something more
but it ain't easy for a small town boy
it ain't easy at all
thinkin it right and doin it wrong
it's easier from an arm chair
waves of alternatives wash over my sleepiness
have my eggs poached for breakfast i guess
I think i'll be clint eastwood
jimi hendrix he was good
let's try william the conqueror
now who else do i like?
Take a piece of my heart
Take a piece of my soul
Let me live
Why don't you take another little piece of my heart
Why don't you take it and break it and tear it all apart
All I do is give and all you do is take
Baby why don't you give me a brand new start
So let me live, so let me live
Let me live, leave me alone
Let me live, baby
And make a brand new start
Why don't you take another little piece of my soul
Why don't you shape it and shake it til you're really in control
All you do is take and all I do is give
All that I'm askin is a chance to live
So let me live, so let me live
Leave me alone, let me live, let me live
Why don't you let me make a brand new start?
And it's a long hard struggle
But you can always depend on me
And if you're ever in trouble
You know where I will be
Why don't you take another little piece of my life
Why don't you twist it and turn it and cut it like a knife
All you do is live all I do is die
Why can't we just be friends, stop livin a lie
So let me live, so let me live
Let me live, leave me alone
Please let me live
Why don't you live a little, baby
Why don't you give a little love?
Go for it baby
Let me live
Please let me live
Baby, let me live
And make a brand new start
Let me live, let me live
Let me live
Come on, let me live
In your heart, baby
Take another piece, take another piece
Take another piece, take another piece
Please let me live
Take another piece, take another piece
Take another piece, take another piece
Why don't you take another piece?
Take another little piece of my heart, baby
Make a brand new start
Baby baby baby baby
Baby baby baby baby
All you do is take, take
Let me live, let me live

You suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you breach
Screw my brain till it hurts
You've taken all my money, you still want more,
Misguided old mule
With your pigheaded rules
With your narrow, minded cronies who are fools of the first division-
Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart,
Death on two legs
You never had a heard of your own,
Kill joy,
Bad guy,
Big talking,
Small fry
You're just an old barrow, boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me,
Can you face me,
But now you can kiss my ass goodbye
Feel good, are you satisfied
Do you feel like suicide 
I think you should
Is your conscience all right
Does it plague you at night,
Do you feel good,
Feel good!
Talk like a big business tycoon,
But you're just a hot, air balloon,
So no one gives you a damn,
You're just an overgrown school, boy
Let me tan your hide. A dog with disease,
King of the sleaze
Put your money where your mouth is
Mr.
Know all,
Was the fin on your back part of the deal. shark!
Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs
You never had a heart of your own,
You never did, right from the start
Insane you should be put inside,
You're a sewer, rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed
Then make yourself null, and, void,
Make me feel good
I feel good.
Scandal, now you've left me all the world's gonna know
Scandal, they're gonna turn our lives into a freak show
They'll see the heartache, they'll see the love break
They'll hear me pleading, we'll say for
God's sake
Over and over and over again
Scandal, now you've left me there's no healing the wounds
Scandal, and all the world can make us out to be fools
Here come the bad news, open the flood gates
They'll leave us bleeding, we'll say you cheapskates
Over and over and over again
So let them know when they stare
It's just a private affair
They'll have us hung in the air
And tell me what do they care
It's only a life to be twisted and broken
They'll see the heartache, they'll see our love break
They'll hear me pleading, I'll say for
God's sake
Over and over and over and over again
Scandal, scandal, scandal
Scandal, yes you're breaking my heart again
Scandal, yes you're loving on out again
Today the headlines, tomorrow hard times
And noone ever really knows the truth from the lies
And in the end the story deeper must hide
Deeper and deeper and deeper inside
Scandal, scandal
Scandal, scandal
One, two, three, four, one

I don't need the passion too
I don't want a stormy affair
To make me feel my life is heading somewhere
All I want is the comfort and care
Just to know that my woman gives me sweet mother love I've walked too long in this lonely lane
I've had enough of this same old game
I'm a man of the world and they say that I'm strong
But my heart is heavy, and my hope is gone
Out in the city, in the cold world outside
I don't want pity, just a safe place to hide
Mama please, let me back inside I don't want to make no waves
But you can give me all the love that I crave
I can't take it if you see me cry
I long for peace before I die
All I want is to know that you're there
You're gonna give me all your sweet mother love
Mother love
My body's aching, but I can't sleep
My dreams are all the company I keep
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down
I'm coming home to my sweet mother love
Mother love
Mother love
Day oh
Day oh
Day oh I think I'm going back to the things I learnt so well in my youth I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
I can't let you stay
Ooh but I can't live if you go away
I don't know just how it goes
All I know is I can't live with you
Yeah I'm having a hard time
I'm walking a fine line between hope and despair
You may think that I don't care
But I travelled a long road to get hold of my sorrow
I tried to catch a dream
But nothing's what it seems
Love is saying baby it's alright
When deep inside you're really petrified
Lover turns to hater
On this escalator
I can't live with you, yeah
But I can't live without you
I can't breathe if you stay
But I can't bear you to go away
I don't know what time it is
All I know is I can't live with you
We're stuck in a bad place
We're trapped in a rat race
And we can't escape
Maybe there's been some mistake
We're trying to make a high score
We're walking through a closed door
And nobody's winning
We're just sinning against ourselves
Hold on baby tell me it's all right
Anger's breaking from the hurt inside
Passions screaming hotter
Doin what we gotta do, yeah
I can't live with you I can't live with you
I can't live I can't live
I can't I can't live with you
But baby I'll never ever leave you
I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
Cause I'm in love with you
Ooh and everything about you
I can't live with you
No I just can't live I just can't live
I can't live with you
Yeah and I can't live without you
Through the madness through the tears
We've still got each other
For a million years, yeah
Ooh yeah
Yeah, I can't live without you, yeah yeah
I can't live without you
Yeah yeah oh oh oh
I can't live without you
Oh oh I can't live without you baby baby baby
