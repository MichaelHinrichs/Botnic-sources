One, Two, Three Go

There's a story told of a very gentle boy
And the girl who wore his ring
Through the wintery snow
Their love they knew was one
For their hearts were full of spring

As the days grew old
And the nights passed into time
And the weeks and years took wing
Gentle boy, tender girl
Their love remained still young
For their hearts were full of spring

Then one day they died
And their graves were side by side
On a hill where robins sing
And they say violets
Grow there the whole year round
For their hearts were full of spring

That was a sample of Beach Boys, Nick
The name

I have watched you on the shore
Standing by the ocean's roar
Do you love me do you surfer girl
Surfer girl surfer girl

We could ride the surf together
While our love would grow
In my Woodie I would take you everywhere I go

So I say from me to you
I will make your dreams come true
Do you love me do you surfer girl
Surfer girl my little surfer girl
Little one
Girl surfer girl my little surfer girl

Little deuce Coupe
You don't know what I got
Little deuce Coupe
You don't know what I got

Well I'm not braggin babe so don't put me down
But I've got the fastest set of wheels in town
When something comes up to me he don't even try
Cause if it had a set of wings man I know she could fly
She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
My little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got

Just a little deuce coupe with a flat head mill
But she'll walk a Thunderbird like sheÕs it's standin still
She's ported and relieved and she's stroked and bored.
She'll do a hundred and forty with the top end floored
She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
My little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got

She's got a competition clutch with the four on the floor
And she purrs like a kitten till the lake pipes roar
And if that aint enough to make you flip your lid
There's one more thing, I got the pink slip daddy

And comin off the line when the light turns green
Well she blows em outta the water like you never seen
I get pushed out of shape and it's hard to steer
When I get rubber in all four gears

She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
My little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
My little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got
She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got


There's a world where I can go and tell my secrets to
In my room, in my room
In this world I lock out all my worries and my fears
In my room, in my room

Do my dreaming and my scheming
Lie awake and pray
Do my crying and my sighing
Laugh at yesterday

Now it's dark and I'm alone
But I won't be afraid
In my room, in my room
In my room, in my room
In my room, in my room

Catch a wave and you're sitting on top of the world

Don't be afraid to try the greatest sport around
Everybody tries it once
Those who don't just have to put it down
You paddle out turn around and raise
And baby that's all there is to the coastline craze
You gotta catch a wave and you're sittin on top of the world

Not just a fad cause it's been going on so long
All the surfers going strong
They said it wouldn't last too long
They'll eat their words with a fork and spoon
And watch em they'll hit the road and all be surfin soon
And when they catch a wave they'll be sittin on top of the world

Catch a wave and your sittin on top of the world

So take a lesson from a top-notch surfer boy
Get yourself a big board
But don't you treat it like a toy
Just get away from the shady turf
And baby go catch some rays on the sunny surf
And when you catch a wave you'll be sittin on top of the world

Catch a wave and you'll be sittin on top of the world
Catch a wave and you'll be sittin on top of the world
Catch a wave and you'll be sittin on top of the world

There's a moon in the sky somewhere I know
Waiting for all the love to burn below
If you fall and it happens all to soon
Blame it all on the surfer moon

'Neath the hill hind the cloud one dreamy night
Rising up throwing down its golden light
If your heart hears this melancholy tune
Then you'll know it's the surfer moon

Brings the tide in
Takes it all away
Helps us ride in
Brings us waves each day
I say

Other moons have brought light and love before
Promising to remain for evermore
But they all disappeared with each new tune
They make way for the surfer moon

Moon
Moon
Moon
Moon


When some loud braggart tries to put me down
And says his school is great
I tell him right away
Now what's the matter buddy
Ain't you heard of my school
It's number one in the state

So be true to your school
Just like you would to your girl or guy
Be true to your school now
Let your colors fly
Be true to your school

I got a letterman's sweater
With a letter in front
I got for football and track
I'm proud to where it now
When I cruise around
The other parts of the town
I got a decal in back

So be true to your school
Just like you would to your girl or guy
Be true to your school now
Let your colors fly
Be true to your school

Come friday we'll be jacked up on the football game
And I'll be ready to fight
We're gonna smash em now
My girlfriend will be working on her pom-poms now
And she'll be yelling tonight

So be true to your school
Just like you would to your girl or guy
Be true to your school now
Let your colors fly
Be true to your school

The Bonneville salt flats had seen some strange things
But the strangest thing yet was a jet without wings
Once as a jet it played in the stars
But now on the ground it's the king of our cars

Spirit of America
Spirit of America
Spirit of America
Spirit of America

Half airplane half auto now famous worldwide
The Spirit of America, the name on the side
The man who would drive her Craig Breedlove by name
A daring young man played a dangerous game

Spirit of America
Spirit of America
Spirit of America
Spirit of America

With a jet for his saddle, a jet for his power
Craig Breedlove had averaged four-o-seven per hour
Both man and machine had given fair warn
They'd set a new record on that warm August morn.

Merry Christmas Saint Nick
Christmas comes this time each year

Well way up north where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas

And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
All he spends all year workin out on his sled

It's the little Saint Nick
Little Saint Nick
It's the little Saint Nick
Little Saint Nick

Just a little bobsled we call the old Saint Nick
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick
She's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel
And when Santa hits the gas man just watch her peel

It's the little Saint Nick
Little Saint Nick

The boat rides we would take
The moonlight on the lake
The way we danced and hummed our favorite songs
The things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long

The Midway and the fun
The Cupie dolls we won
The bell I rung to prove that I was strong
The things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long

The early morning hike
The rented tandem bike
The lunches that we used to pack

We never could explain that sudden summer rain
The looks we got when we got back
The leaves began to fade
Like promises we made
How could a love that seemed so right go wrong?
The things we did last summer
I'll remember all winter long


Well she got her daddy's car
And she cruised through the hamburger stand now
Seems she forgot all about the library
Like she told her old man now
And with the radio blasting
Goes cruising just as fast as she can now

And she'll have fun fun fun
'Til her daddy takes the T-Bird away
Fun fun fun til her daddy takes the T-Bird away

Well the girls can't stand her
'Cause she walks looks and drives like an ace now
You walk like an ace now you walk like an ace
She makes the Indy 500 look like a Roman chariot race now
You look like an ace now you look like an ace
A lotta guys try to catch her
But she leads them on a wild goose chase now
You drive like an ace now you drive like an ace

And she'll have fun fun fun
'Til her daddy takes the T-Bird away
Fun fun fun til her daddy takes the T-Bird away

Well you knew all along
That your dad was gettin wise to you now
You shouldn't have lied now you shouldn't have lied
And since he took your set of keys
You've been thinking that your fun is all through now
You shouldn't have lied now you shouldn't have lied
But you can come along with me
'Cause we gotta a lot of things to do now
You shouldn't have lied now you shouldn't have lied

And we'll have fun fun fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away
Fun fun fun now that daddy took the T-Bird away

Well its been building up inside of me
For oh I don't know how long
I don't know why
But I keep thinking
Something's bound to go wrong

But she looks in my eyes
And makes me realize
And she says "Don't worry baby"
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright

Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby

I guess I should've kept my mouth shut
When I started to brag about my car
But I can't back down now
I pushed the other guys too far

She makes me come alive
And makes me wanna drive
When she says "Don't worry baby"
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright

Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby

She told me Baby, when you race today
Just take along my love with you
And if you know how much I loved you
Baby nothing could go wrong with you"

Oh what she does to me
When she makes love to me
And she says "Don't worry baby"
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Everything will turn out alright

Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby
Don't worry baby

All summer long you've been with me
I can't see enough of you
All summer long we've both been free
Won't be long til summer time is through
Summer time is through
Not for us now

Miniature golf and Hondas in the hills
Miniature golf and Hondas in the hills
When we rode the horse we got some thrills
Every now and then we hear our song
Every now and then we hear our song
We've been having fun all summer long

Won't be long til summer time is through
Summer time is through
Not for us now
Every now and then we hear our song
Every now and then we hear our song
We've been having fun all summer long
We've been having fun all summer long
We've been having fun all summer long
We've been having fun all summer long
We've been having fun all summer long
We've been having fun all summer long


GO!

I'm gonna wake you up early
Cause I'm gonna take a ride with you
We're going down to the Honda shop
I'll tell you what we're gonna do
Put on a ragged sweatshirt
I'll take you anywhere you want me to

First gear Honda Honda it's alright faster faster
Second gear little Honda Honda I lean right faster faster
Third gear Honda Honda hang on tight faster faster
Faster it's alright

It's not a big motorcycle
Just a groovy little motorbike
It's more fun that a barrel of monkeys
That two wheel bike
We'll ride on out of the town
To any place I know you like

First gear Honda Honda it's alright faster faster
Second gear little Honda Honda I lean right faster faster
Third gear Honda Honda hang on tight faster faster
Faster it's alright

It climbs the hills like a matchless
Cause my Honda's built really light
When I go into the turns
Lean [Tilt] with me and hang on tight
I better turn on the lights
So we can ride my Honda tonight

First gear Honda Honda it's alright faster faster
Second gear little Honda Honda I lean right faster faster
Third gear Honda Honda hang on tight faster faster
Faster it's alright

First gear Honda Honda it's alright faster faster
Second gear little Honda Honda I lean right faster faster
Third gear Honda Honda hang on tight faster faster
Faster it's alright


Wendy, Wendy what went wrong
Oh so wrong
We went together for so long

I never thought a guy could cry
'Til you made it with another guy
Oh Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurt so bad

Wendy, Wendy don't lose your head
Lose your head
Wendy don't believe a word he says

I can't picture you with him
His future looks awful dim
Oh Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurt so bad

Wendy I wouldn't hurt you like that
No no no
I thought we had our love down pat
Guess I was wrong

The farthest thing from my mind 
Was the day that I'd wake up to find 
My Wendy
Wendy left me alone

Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurts so bad
Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurts so bad
Wendy, Wendy left me alone
Hurts so bad
Wendy, Wendy


The girls dig the way the guys get all wiped out
With their feet in the air you can hear em shout
They're not afraid don't back down, don't back down
Not my boys don't back down, don't back down
They grit their teeth, a-oo they don't back down

Don't back down
You gotta be a little nuts
Don't back down
But show em now who's got guts
Don't back down
Don't back down from that wave

With their feet full of tar and their hair full of sand
The boys know the beach like the palm of their hand
They're not afraid don't back down, don't back down
Not my boys don't back down, don't back down
They grit their teeth a-oo they don't back down

Don't back down
You gotta be a little nuts
Don't back down
But show em now who's got guts
Don't back down
Don't back down from that wave

When a twenty-footer sneaks up like a ton of lead
And the crest comes along and slaps em upside the head
They're not afraid don't back down, don't back down
Not my boys Don't back down, don't back down
They grit their teeth a-oo they don't back down

Don't back down
You gotta be a little nuts
Don't back down
But show em now who's got guts
Don't back down
Don't back down from that wave

Don't back down

When I grow up to be a man
Will I dig the same things that turn me on as a kid?
Will I look back and say that I wish I hadn't done what I did?
Will I joke around and still dig those sounds
When I grow up to be a man?

Will I look for the same things in a woman that I dig in a girl?
fourteen fifteen
Will I settle down fast or will I first wanna travel the world?
sixteen seventeen
Now I'm young and free, but how will it be
When I grow up to be a man?

And please forgive my shaking
Can't you tell my heart is breaking?
Can't make myself say what I planned to say

Baby
Please let me wonder
If I've been the one you love
Please let me wonder
If I'm who you're dreaming of
Please let me wonder, love

I built all my goals around you
That some day my love would surround you
You'll never know what we've been through

For so long I thought about it
And now I just can't live without it
This beautiful image I have of you

She knows me
She knows me

Sometimes I have a weird way of showing my love
And I always expect her to know what I'm thinking of

She knows me

I treat her so mean I don't deserve what I have
And I think that she'll forgive just by making her laugh
But she knows me

She knows me too well
Knows me so well
That she can tell
I really love her
She knows me too well

I get so jealous of the other guy
And then I'm not happy til I make her break down and cry
When I look at other girls it must kill her inside
But it'd be another story if she looked at the guys
But she knows me

She knows me too well
Knows me so well
That she can tell
I really love her
She knows me too well

She knows me
She knows me

When I look at other girls it must kill her inside
But it'd be another story if she looked at the guys
Cause she knows me

Knows me so well
That she can tell
I really love her
She knows me too well

And the Northern girls with the way they kiss
They keep their boyfriends warm at night

Well I walked up to her and I asked her if she wanted to dance
She looked awful nice and so I hoped she might take a chance

When we danced I held her tight
Then I walked her home that night
And all the stars were shining bright
And then I kissed her

Each time I saw her I couldn't wait to see her again
I wanted to let her know that I was more than a friend

I didn't know just what to do
And so I whispered I love you
And she said that she loved me too
And then I kissed her

I kissed her in a way that I'd never kissed a girl before
I kissed her in a way that I hope she liked for evermore

I knew that she was mine so I gave her all the love that I had
Then one day she'll take me home to meet her mom and her dad

Then I asked her to be my bride
And always be right by my side
I felt so happy that I almost cried
And then I kissed her

And then I kissed her
And then I kissed her


You're so sleepy
Wish that he could stay
Love him so
But now it's getting late
He'll be waiting
Waiting just for you
One more summer
And your dream comes true


We met when she was younger
Then I had no eyes for her
A few years went by and I saw her
Now I'm gonna try for her

Look out babe

She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew

How could I ever have known that
She'd be what she is today
And look at how her boyfriend holds her
I'll be moving in one day

Split man

She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew

La doo day pow pow pow

We come on the sloop John B
My grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinking all night
Got into a fight
Well I feel so broke up
I want to go home

So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the Captain ashore
Let me go home, let me go home
I wanna go home, yeah yeah
Well I feel so broke up
I wanna go home

The first mate he got drunk
And broke in the Cap'n's trunk
The constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone
Why don't you leave me alone, yeah yeah
Well  I feel so broke up I wanna go home

So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the Captain ashore
Let me go home, let me go home
I wanna go home, let me go home
Why don't you let me go home
Hoist up the John B's sail
Hoist up the John B
I feel so broke up I wanna go home
Let me go home

The poor cook he caught the fits
And threw away all my grits
And then he took and he ate up all of my corn
Let me go home
Why don't they let me go home
This is the worst trip I've ever been on

So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the Captain ashore
Let me go home, let me go home
I wanna go home, let me go home
Why don't you let me go home


Wouldn't it be nice if we were older
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kind of world where we belong

You know its gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

Happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was neverending
Wouldn't it be nice

Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true
Baby then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married
And then we'd be happy

Wouldn't it be nice

You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But lets talk about it
Wouldn't it be nice


I know perfectly well
I'm not where I should be
I've been very aware
You've been patient with me

Every time we break up
You bring back your love to me
And after all I've done to you
How can it be

You still believe in me

I try hard to be more
What you want me to be
But I can't help how I act
When you're not here with me

I try hard to be strong
But sometimes I fail myself
And after all I've promised you
So faithfully

You still believe in me

I wanna cry


I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it

God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me

God only knows what I'd be without you

God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Well life would still go on believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me

God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you


I know so many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads and stay in their saftey zones

Now what can you tell them
And what can you say that won't make them defensive

Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight

They come on like their peaceful
But inside they're so uptight
They trip through the day
And waste all their thoughts at night

Now how can I say it
And how can I come on
When I know I'm guilty

Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight

Now how can I say it
And how can I come on
When I know I'm guilty

So hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight


I keep looking for a place to fit
Where I can speak my mind
I've been trying hard to find the people
That I won't leave behind

They say I got brains
But they ain't doing me no good
I wish they could

Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin for myself
But what goes wrong

Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
Can't find nothin I can put my heart and soul into
Sometimes I feel very sad
Can't find nothin I can put my heart and soul into

I guess I just wasn't made for these times

Every time I get the inspiration
To go change things around
No one wants to help me look for places
Where new things might be found

Where can I turn when my fair weather friends cop out
What's it all about

Each time things start to happen again
I think I got something good goin for myself
But what goes wrong

Sometimes I feel very sad
Sometimes I feel very sad
Can't find nothin I can put my heart and soul into
Sometimes I feel very sad
Can't find nothin I can put my heart and soul into

I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times
I guess I just wasn't made for these times


Where did your long hair go
Where is the girl I used to know
How could you lose that happy glow
Oh, Caroline no

Who took that look away
I remember how you used to say
You'd never change, but that's not true
Oh, Caroline you

Break my heart
I want to go and cry
It's so sad to watch a sweet thing die
Oh, Caroline why

Could I ever find in you again
The things that made me love you so much then
Could we ever bring em back once they have gone
Oh, Caroline no


I, I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

I'm pickin up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations
I'm pickin up good vibrations
Oom bop bop good vibrations
She's giving me excitations
Oom bop bop excitations
Good good good good vibrations
Oom bop bop
She's giving me excitations
Oom bop bop excitations
Good good good good vibrations
Oom bop bop
She's giving me excitations
Oom bop bop excitations

Close my eyes
She's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world

I'm pickin up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations
I'm pickin up good vibrations
Oom bop bop good vibrations
She's giving me excitations
Oom bop bop excitations

I've been in this town so long that back in the city
I've been taken for a lost and gone
An unknown for a long long time

Fell in love years ago
With an innocent girl
From the Spanish and Indian home 
Home of the heroes and villains
Once at night Catillion squared the fight
And she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her down
But she's still dancing in the night
Unafraid of what a dudeÕll do in a town full of heroes and villains

In the cantina
Margarita's keep the spirit high
There I watched her
She spun around and
Round in the warmth of her body
Fanned the flame of the dance
Dance Margarita don't you know that IÕm in love with you
Dance
Dance

You're under arrest!

My children were raised
You know they suddenly rise
They started slow long ago
Head to toe healthy weathy and  often wise

At three score and five
I'm very much alive
I still got the jive to survive with the heroes and villains


Ooga wah ooga ah

Bicycle rider
Just see what youÕve done done
To the church of the American Indian

Ahhhhh
Doot doot doot doot doot doot doot
Ahhh-hh-hh-hh-hh-hh-hh-hh
Doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot doot

She belongs there left with her liberty
Never known as a non-believer
She laughs and stays in the won-won-won- wonderful

She knew how together the forest went
God reached softly and moved her body
One golden locket
Quite young and loving her mother and father

Farther down the path was a mystery
Through the recess the chalk and numbers
A boy bumped into her won-won-won- wonderful

All fall down and lost in the mystery
Lost it all to a non-believer
And all that's left is a girl
Who's loved by her mother and father

She'll return in love with her liberty
Just away from the non-believer
She'll sigh and thank God for won-won-won- wonderful


Light the lamp and fire mellow,
Cabin essence timely hello,
Welcomes the time for a change.

Lost and found, you still remain there.
You'll find a meadow filled with grain there.
I'll give you a home on the range.

I want to watch you windblown facing
Waves of wheat for your embracing.
Folks sing a song of the grange.

Nestle in a kiss below there.
The constellations ebb and flow there.
And witness our home on the range.

Who ran the iron horse?
Truck driving man do what you can
Who ran the iron horse?
High-tail your load off the road
Who ran the iron horse?
Out of night-life-it's a gas man
Who ran the iron horse?
I don't believe I gotta grieve
Who ran the iron horse?
In and out of luck
Who ran the iron horse?
With a buck and a booth
Who ran the iron horse?
Catchin on to the truth
Who ran the iron horse?
In the vast past, the last gasp
Who ran the iron horse?
In the land, in the dust, trust that you must
Who ran the iron horse?

Over and over, 
The crow cries uncover the cornfield.
Over and over, 
The thresher and hover the wheat field.

Hanging down from my window
Those are my wind chimes
On the warm breeze the little bells
Tinkle like wind chimes
Though it's hard I try not to look at my wind chimes
Now and then a tear rolls off my cheek

Close your eyes and lean back now listen to wind chimes
In the late afternoon you're hung up on wind chimes
Though it's hard I try not to look at my wind chimes


Rock, rock and roll
Plymouth Rock roll over

Cart off and sell my vegetables

The diamond necklace played the pawn
Hand in hand some drummed along
To a handsome mannered baton
A blind class aristocracy
Back through the opera glass you see
The pit and the pendulum drawn
Columnated ruins domino

Hung velvet overtaken me
Dim chandelier awaken me
To a song dissolved in the dawn
The music hall a costly bow
The music all is lost for now
To a muted trumpeter swan
Columnated ruins domino

Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping, Brother John?

Dove nested towers the hour was
Strike the street quicksilver moon
Carriage across the fog
Two-Step to lamp lights cellar tune
The laughs come hard in Auld Lang Syne

The glass was raised, the fired-roast
The fullness of the wine, the dim last toasting
While at port adieu or die

A choke of grief heart hardened I
Beyond belief a broken man too tough to cry

Surf's Up
Aboard a tidal wave
Come about hard and join
The young and often spring you gave
I heard the word
Wonderful thing
A children's song


On and on she go dum bay do da
On and on she go dum be do
On and on she go dum bay do da
On and on she go dum be do

You know they suddenly rise
They started slow long ago
Head to toe healthy weathy and wise

I've been in this town so long

To ride in the rough
And sunny down snuff I'm alright

Don't take her out of my life
What would I do without her tell me now

Let the bird sing
With the coming spring
Let the church bells ring
Let the rain fall

Please keep her a part of my life

Looking up at the stars

Can't wait forever
Awoke in the night again
We were together
Windows of darkness are
All I can see through
Searching the shadows
Hoping to see you
Baby you know that I
Can't wait forever
Awoke in the night again
We were together
Baby you know that I

As I sit and close my eyes
There's peace in my mind
And I'm hoping that you'll find it too
And these feelings in my heart
I know are meant for you

Meant for you


We've been friends now for so many years
We've been together through the good times and the tears
Turned each other on to the good things that life has to give

We drift apart for a little bit of a spell
One night I get a call and I know that you're well
And days I was down you would help me get out of my hole

Ohhhhhhhh

Let's be friends
Let's be friends
Let's be friends

You told me when my girl was untrue
I loaned you money when the funds weren't too cool
I talked your folks out of making you cut off your hair

We've been friends now for so many years
We've been together through the good times and the tears
Dim dipple ee dim dipple ay dim dipple oo dim dee aye oh


Little bird up in a tree
Looked down and sang a song to me
Of how it began

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

The trout in the shiny brook
Gave the worm another look
And told me not to worry
About my life

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na

Tree in my own backyard
Stands all alone
Bears fruit for me
And it tastes so good

Where's my pretty bird
He must have flown away
If I keep singing
He'll come back someday

Dawn, bird's still gone
Guess I'll go mow the lawn

What a day, what a day
Oooo, what a beautiful day this is

Ooooooooo

Little bird up in a tree
Looked down a sang a song to me

The trout in a shiny brook
Gave the worm another look
And told me not to worry about my life

Little bird looked down
And sang a song to me
Little bird looked down
And sang a songto me

I had to fix a lot of things this morning
'Cause they were so scrambled
But now it's okay
I tell you I've got enough to do

The afternoon was filled up with phone calls
What a hot sticky day, yeah yeah yeah
The air is cooling down

Take all the time you need
It's a lovely night
If you decide to come
You're gonna do it right

Drive for a couple miles
You'll see a sign and turn left
For a couple blocks
Next is mine, you'll turn left on a little road
It's a bumpy one

You'll see a white fence
Move the gate and drive through on the left side
Come right in
And you'll find me in my house somewhere
Keeping busy while I wait

I get a lot of thoughts in the morning
I write em all down
If it wasn't for that
I'd forget em in a while

And lately I've been thinking Ôbout a good friend
I'd like to see more of, yeah yeah yeah
I think I'll make a call

I wrote a number down
But I lost it
So I searched through my pocket book
I couldn't find it
So I sat and concentrated on the number
And slowly it came to me
So I dialed it

And I let it ring a few times
There was no answer
So I let it ring a little more
Still no answer

So I hung up the telephone
Got some paper and sharpened up a pencil
And wrote a letter to my friend


It's automatic when I
Talk with old friends
The conversation turns to
Girls we knew when their
Hair was soft and long and the
Beach was the place to go

Suntanned bodies and
Waves of sunshine the
California girls and a 
Beautiful coastline
Warmed up weather
Let's get together and
Do it again

With a girl the lonely sea looks good in moonlight
Makes your nighttimes warm and out of sight

Been so long
Hey now hey now hey now hey now hey now
Hey now hey now hey now hey now hey now

Well I've been thinking bout
All the places we've surfed and danced and
All the faces we've missed so let's get
Back together and do it again

Ow!


Ahhhhhh  oooooo

This is the way
I always dreamed it would be
The way that it is, oh oh
When you are holding me
I never had a love of my own
Maybe that's why when we're all alone

I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby seems to disappear
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near

Lovin you
It keeps me satisfied
And I can't explain, oh no
The way I'm feeling inside
You look at me we kiss and then
I close my eyes and here it comes again

I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby seems to disappear
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near

I hear the music all the time, yeah
I hear the music, hold me tight now baby
I hear the music all the time
I hear the music
I hear the music baby

Ahhhhh

I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby seems to disappear
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near


I took a walk and sat down in a park
The gardener walked out and the sprinklers went on
They watered the lawn and I went to sleep

Ten thirty I turned my radio on
Some group was playing a musical song
It wasn't too long and I went to sleep

Again at the park on a nice summer day
High up above me the trees gently sway
A bird flew away and I went to sleep


I looked at you baby
And what did I see
I saw love in your eyes
Made me feel so warm inside

Now look at me baby
And what do you see
You see love in my eyes
Gleaming just for you

And now we know it's
Time to get alone
To get alone
And just be together
We'll get alone together

Come and do a couple days
Just a ways
Away from the people
And safe from the people

The pine-scented air
Smells so good in the snow
In our toboggan we'll go
Screaming down the mountainside

The touch of your cheeks
When they're rosy and cold
Feels so cozy to hold
Just to take you close
And make you warm and

Time to get alone
To get alone
And just be together
We'll get alone together

Come and do a couple days
Just a ways
Away from the people
And safe from the people

Lyin down on our backs
Lookin at the sky
Looking down through the valley so 
Deep and wide

Aren't you glad we finally got away
Glad we finally got away
Aren't you glad we finally got away

Now I looked around baby
And what do I see
I see love in your eyes
And I'm so glad that we
Finally had some

Time to get alone
To get alone
And just be together
We'll get alone together

Come and do a couple days
Just a ways
Away from the people
And safe from the people


Break break shakeaway
Break breakaway
Now  I'm free to do what I wanna do

Time will not wait for me
Time is my destiny
Why change the part of me that has to be free
The love that passed me by
I found no reason why

But now each day is filled with the love
That very same love
That passed me by
And that is why

I can breakaway from that lonely life
And I can do what I wanna do
And breakaway from that empty life
And my world is knew

When I lay down on my bed
I heard voices in my head
Telling me now "Hey it's only a dream"
The more I thought of it
I had been out of it
And here's the answer I found instead

Baby baby
Found out it was in my head
Baby baby
Baby baby
Found out it was my head
Baby baby
Baby baby
Found out it was in my head
Baby baby

And I can breakaway to the better life
Where the shackles never hold me down
I gonna make a way for each happy day
As my life turns around

Come on we're free to breakaway
Oh boy you jump for joy
Now won't you come on
When you breakaway
You're free to breakaways
Breakaway
Come on you're free to breakaway

When I was a little bitty baby
My mama done rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home
It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home

Let me tell you now well I got me in a fix
I caught a nail in my tire doing lickitey splits
I had to walk a long long way to town
I came upon a nice old man well he had a hat on
Wait a minute mister can you give me some directions
I'm gonna want to be right off for home

When I was a little bitty baby
My mama done rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home
It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home

Don't care if them cotton balls get rotten
When I got you baby, who needs cotton
In them old cotton fields back home
Brother only one thing more that's gonna warm you
A summer's day out in California
It's gonna be those cotton fields back home

It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
Give me them cotton fields
It was back in Louisiana
Let me hear it for the cotton fields
Just about a mile from Texarkana
You know that there's just no place like home

Oh boy it sure feels good to breathe the air back home
You shoulda seen their faces when they seen how I grown
In them old cotton fields back home


Started off the day with a thought
That took me far away
I think I found a place
Where I know I could be forever
It's down in San Miguel
Could be in Mexico
Where you donÕt need no dough
And now IÕm gonna go

Lookin for the ladies of love

I know where IÕm going
Going straight ahead
Down into San Miguel
Over the top
We cross the boarder now
Heading into San Miguel

That's where I'm gonna go
Hope you will be coming too
You can kick off your shoes
C'mon it's time to go

Lookin for the ladies of love

Ow ow

It's down in San Miguel
Could be in Mexico
Where you donÕt need no dough
And now IÕm gonna go

Lookin for the ladies of love


I just looked to see the sun outside
It's shining so bright
A sun the clouds can't hide
Do you remember the time that you hear me say

I like to play games that two can play
Ah ha ha ha haaa
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa whoa whoa
Oh oh oh oh

No more

The juke box daddies been blowin my mind
I ain't goin nowhere I got lots of time
I'm fat as a cow oh how'd I ever get this way

I like to play games that two can play
Ah ha ha ha haaa
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa whoa whoa
Oh oh oh oh

No more

In the morning people are so happy
And that's the time when I'm a mister bussinessman
Later on I really get to goin yeah
I get my motor runnin
I get my legs to movin

It's just no good unless two can play
Ah ha haaaa

I was layin on my back
Relaxin in the night
I played my radio
It was out of sight
Joe South was singing
"Games People Play"

And I like to play games that two can play
Ah ha ha ha haaa
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa whoa whoa
Oh oh oh oh

Yeah-e-eah
Ah ha ha ha haaa


Five long days and I'm tired of working
I'm going to see my boss today
In fifteen minutes I'll be on the train
'Cause I just got my pay

Now I could take and sock away my dough
And make me six percent a year
But it's not much fun to wait around for that
When I can spend it while it's here

Let's get dressed up
And see a movie

I like spending my money
And I like having a good time
Good times sure make me happy
And I'm so happy 
'Cause I just got my pay

Monday morning I'm up and at it
Those last two days were good for my soul
It's time to do my working thing
I'm late so I got to roll

My take home comes to bout ninety-five
And my boss is giving me some praise
If it weren't for me the place would fall apart
I think I'll hit him up for a raise

Let's get undressed
And climb in bed too

I like spending my money
And I like having a good time
Good times sure make me happy
And I'm so happy 
'Cause I just got my pay


I'm thinking about a-this whole world
Late at night I think about the love of this whole world
Lots of different people everywhere
And when I go anywhere I see love I see love I see love

When girls get mad at boys and go
Many times they're just putting on a show
But when they leave you wait alone

You are there like everywhere like everyone you see
Happy cause your living and your free

Now here comes another day for your love
I'm thinking about a-this whole world
A-this whole world
Love

Woo oo oo oo ooo ooo oo oo
Woo oo oo oo ooo ooo oo oo

Aummmmm wooo wooooo bop didit

Late at night I think about the love of this whole world
This whole world
Oomm dot dit it
Oomm dot dit it
Oomm dot dit it


The sunday mornin gospel goes good with the soul
There's blues, folk, and country, and rock like a rollin stone
The world could come together as one
If everybody under the sun
Add some music to your day
Add some music add some add some music to your day
A bob didit a bop didit

You'll hear it while you're walkin by a neighbor's home
You'll hear it faintly in the distance when you're on the phone
You're sittin in a dentist's chair
And they've got music for you there
To add some music
Add some music add some add some music to your
To your day
A bob didit a bop didit

Add some music music everywhere add some music
Add some add some add some add some music add some music
Your doctor knows it keeps you calm
Your preacher adds it to his psalms
So add some music
Add some music add some add some music to your
To your day

When you're alone
Add some music add some music
Is like a companion
Add some music add some music
For your lonely soul
Oo oo oo woo oo woo oo oo oo oooo

When day is over when day is over
I close my tired eyes I close my tired
Music is in my soul

At a movie you can feel it touching your heart
And on every day of the summertime
You'll hear children chasing ice cream carts
They'll play it on your wedding day
There must be bout a million ways
To add some music
Add some music add some add some music to your
To your day

Add some music to your day 
Add some music to your day

If every word I said 
Could make you laugh
I'd talk forever together my love
I ask the sky just what we had
Mmm It shone forever together my love my my my my my my my my my my my

If the song I sing to you
Could fill your heart with joy
I'd sing forever together my love my my my my

Do do do do do do do do do together my love

I thought about a summer day
And how the time just floats away
Pretty things like incense and flowers
I wanna make them part of

Our sweet love
Could last forever
Our sweet love
Our sweet love
Could last forever

I thought about a winter night
And how I'd like to hold you tight
Candlelight the warmth of the fire
We could make them part of

Our sweet love
Honey it's heaven
Our sweet love
Our sweet love
Could last forever

Sweet love sweet love

Like a child with his new toy
My heart is filled with joy for

Our sweet love
Honey it's heaven
Our sweet love
Our sweet love

Lord knows I love her so
I feel it down inside my soul
A precious love like this can flower
There's nothing in this world like

Our sweet love
Should last forever
Our sweet love
Our sweet love
Could last forever
Our sweet love
Could last forever
Our sweet love
Could last forever
Our sweet love
Oh


Stark naked in front of my mirror
A pudgy person somehow did appear
Seems lately all I've eaten sugar and fat
It's getting obvious that's not where it's at
A big pot and tripley chin
Oh what condition my condition was in
Laughing at myself at what a crying shame
What ever happened to my Greek godly frame

Cyclamates juicy steaks, sweet things too
Aren't always good as they seem

Doughy lumps, stomach pumps, enemas too
That's what you get when you eat that way

I read a book on organic foods
Jumped on a health food kick
Put me in the mood
You may not get to perfect overnight
But on the way you're feeling clean out of sight
We ate tonight at Fairfax and 3rd
We're gonna spread the news and give you the word
We hope that soon you'll eat like we did today
We're mighty thankful now that H.E.L.P.'s on its way
Salad with a special knock you right off your seat
With carrot juice to wash it all down
Yummy carob cookies are an organic treat
And H.E.L.P. has got the best food in town

H.-E.-L.-P.
H.E.L.P. your education creates much benefit and peace

Hamburgers and hot dogs throw em all out
You'll feel so good you'll jump up and shout
If you haven't why don't you go shopping today
And member now that H.E.L.P. s on its way

H.-E.-L.-P.
Radiant Radish is gonna be on Fairfax and 3rd
Sansasanth and Melrose 10452
Ooo get yourself in for a snack
Yeah, but stop by the Radiant Radish


Born of the age
Flagged hopes
Censored rage
The black clad box
Bombs bursting in air
Bleed white red and blue
Cried dawn's early light
For the hope

Oh where has it gone
Brothers sisters stand firmly and try
Reaching the spacious ski-ies
Fourth of July

Lie by the sword
Black times
False reward
The greetings of doom
So proudly they hail
Lost fortune of free
The stripes and bright stars 
Promise lost

Oh where has it gone
Brothers sisters stand firmly and try
Reaching the spacious ski-ies
Fourth of July

Brothers sisters stand firmly and try
Reaching the spacious ski-ies
Fourth of July


So hard to answer future's riddle
When ahead is seeming so far behind
So hard to laugh a child-like giggle
When the tears start to torture my mind
So hard to shed the life of before
To let my soul automatically soar

But I hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the roaddblocks a-stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down

Sew up the wounds of evolution
And the now starts to get in my way
So what if life's a revelation
If the mind speaks of only today
So real, the pain growing in my soul
Of climbing up to reality's goal

But I hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the roaddblocks a-stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down

Long promised road
Trail starts at dawn
Carries on to the season's ending
Long promised road
Flows to the source, gentle force, never ending, never ending

So hard to lift the jeweled sceptre
When the weight turns a smile to a frown
So hard to drink of passion nectar
When the taste of life's holding me down
So hard to plant the seed of reform
To set my sights on defeating the storm

So I hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the roaddblocks a-stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down

Oh, yeah-eah-eah-eah

Hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the roaddblocks a-stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down

Oh, yeah-eah-eah-eah

Hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the roaddblocks a-stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down

I'd love to see you
I'd love to see you
I'd love to see you
I'd love to see you
I'd love to see you


Clearing skies and drying eyes
Now I see your smile
Darkness goes and softness shows
A changing style

Just in time words that rhyme
Well bless your soul
Now I'll fill your hands
With kisses and a Tootsie Roll

Oh reality, it's not for me
And it makes me laugh
Oh, fantasy world and Disney girls
I'm coming back

Patti Page and summer days
On old Cape Cod
Happy times making wine
In my garage
Country shade and lemonade

Guess I'm slowing down
It's a turned back world
With a local girl
In a smaller town

Open cars and clearer stars
That's what I've lacked
But fantasy world and Disney girls
I'm coming back

Love 
Hi Rick and Dave
Hi Pop
Well good morning mom
Love get up guess what
I'm in love with a girl I found
She's really swell
Cause she likes
Church, bingo chances and old time dances

All my life I spent the night
With dreams of you
And the warmth I missed
And for the things I wished
They're all coming true

I've got my love to give
And a place to live
Guess I'm gonna stay
It'd be a peaceful life
With a forever wife
And a kid someday

It's earlier nights
And pillow fights
And your soft laugh
Fantasy world and Disney girls
I'm coming back


A diamond necklace played the pawn
Hand in hand some drummed along, oh
To a handsome mannered baton
A blind class aristocracy
Back through the opera glass you see
The pit and the pendulum drawn
Columnated ruins domino

Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping?

Hung velvet overtaken me
Dim chandelier awaken me
To a song dissolved in the dawn
The music hall a costly bow
The music all is lost for now
To a muted trumpeter swan
Columnated ruins domino

Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping, Brother John?

Dove nested towers the hour was
Strike the street quicksilver moon
Carriage across the fog
Two-Step to lamp lights cellar tune
The laughs come hard in Auld Lang Syne

The glass was raised, the fired-roast
The fullness of the wine, the dim last toasting
While at port adieu or die

A choke of grief heart hardened I
Beyond belief a broken man too tough to cry

Surf's Up
Aboard a tidal wave
Come about hard and join
The young and often spring you gave
I heard the word
Wonderful thing
A children's song

Child, child, child, child, child
A child is the father of the man
Child, child, child, child, child
A child is the father of the man
A children's song
Have you listened as they played
Their song is love
And the children know the way
That's why the child is the father to the man
Child, child, child, child, child
Child, child, child, child, child
Na na na na na na na na
Child, child, child, child, child
That's why the child is the father to the man
Child, child, child, child, child


I'm a cork on the ocean
Floating over the raging sea
How deep is the ocean?
How deep is the ocean?
I lost my way
Hey hey hey

I'm a rock in a landslide
Rolling over the mountainside
How deep is the valley?
How deep is the valley?
It kills my soul
Hey hey hey

I'm a leaf on a windy day
Pretty soon I'll be blown away
How long will the wind blow?
How long will the wind blow?
Ohhhh

Until I die
Until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die


I sailed an ocean, unsettled ocean
Through restful waters and deep commotion
Often frightened, unenlightened
Sail on, sail on sailor

I wrest the waters, fight Neptune's waters
Sail through the sorrows of life's marauders
Unrepenting, often empty
Sail on, sail on sailor

Caught like a sewer rat alone but I sail
Bought like a crust of bread, but oh do I wail

Seldom stumble, never crumble
Try to tumble, life's a rumble
Feel the stinging I've been given
Never ending, unrelenting
Heartbreak searing, always fearing
Never caring, persevering
Sail on, sail on, sailor

I work the seaways, the gale-swept seaways
Past shipwrecked daughters of wicked waters
Uninspired, drenched and tired
Wail on, wail on, sailor

Always needing, even bleeding
Never feeding all my feelings
Damn the thunder, must I blunder
There's no wonder all I'm under
Stop the crying and the lying
And the sighing and my dying

Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor


On my way to sunny California
On my way to spend another sunny day

Water, water get yourself in the cool, clear, water
The sun shines brightly down on Penny's place
The sun shines brightly down on the bay
The air's so clean it'll just take your mind away
Take your mind away
Take your mind away

Have you ever been south of Monterey
Barrancas carve the coast line and the chaparral flows to the sea
'Neath waves of golden sunshine
And have you ever been north of Morro Bay
The south coast plows the sea
And the people there are of the breed 
They don't need electricity
Water, water, cool cascades of clear, clear water
The sun dance final scene sets the hills ablaze.
Horizon edges quick up the mountain's way.

Have you ever been down Salinas way?
Where Steinbeck found the valley
And he wrote about it the way it was in his travelin's with Charley
And have you ever walked down through the sycamores
Where the farmhouse used to be
There the monarch's autumn journey ends
On a windswept cyprus tree

Water get  water get yourself in that 
Get yourself in that get yourself in that cool, clear, water
The sun shines brightly down on Penny's place
Get yourself in that water
The air's so clean that it just takes your mind away
Take your mind away
Take your mind away

Have you ever been to a festival, the Big Sur congregation?
Where Country Joe will do his show
And he'd sing about liberty
And the people there in the open air, one big family.
Yeah the people there love to sing and share
Their new found liberty


Hi
Trader

Trader sailed a jeweled crown
Humanity rowed the way
Exploring to command more land
Scheming how to rule the waves.
Trader spied a virgin plain 
And named it for velvet robes
Wrote home declaring,
"There's a place
Where totally folks are free
Happily completely
Nourishment fills the prairies and the hillsides
And animals stalk the mountains and the seaside
And fish abound the lakes and birds the skies
Signed sincerely."

Trader found the jeweled land
Was occupied before he came
By humans of a second look
Who couldn't even write their names shame
Trader said they're not as good
As folks who wear velvet robes
Wrote home again and asked, "Please help 
Their breasts I see, they're not like me
Banish them from our prairies and our hillsides
Clear them from our mountains and our seaside
I want them off our lakes so please reply
Signed sincerely."

Trader he got the crown okay
Cleared humanity from his way
He civilized all he saw
Making changes every single day say
Shops sprang over the prairies and the hillsides
Then roads cut through the mountains to the seaside
The other kind fled to hide, by and by,
And so sincerely 
Cried.

Making it softly
Like the evening sea, trying to be
Making it go
Creating it gently
Like a morning breeze, a life of ease
Eyes that see 
Beyond tomorrow, through to the time without hours
Passing the Eden of Flowers
Reason to live.

Embracing together
Like the merging streams, crying dreams
Making it full
Begging intently
For a slight reprieve, a night of ease
Hands to touch
Beyond the sorrow, on to the force without power
Piercing the crust of the tower
Reason to live.

Hoping
Like a budding rose, humbling shows
Making it.
Struggling lonely
Like a desert field, break the seal, make it real
Ears to hear
Beyond the showers, on to the suns of tomorrows
Burning the flesh of all sorrows
Reason to live.
Reason to continue
Reason to go on
Reason to live
Reason to live
Reason to live


A Pisces lady loves romance She loves romance
Her movements tell you at a glance She loves to dance
Why they say Pisces rules the dance She's got the glance

I need a breeze blowing softly
To keep my wind vane from standing
I need a whole lot of sunshine
To keep my sundial advancing
I need some soil fore my grass will grow
I need some spark to make my candle glow

Relief I cried
Ain't no shuck n jive
I need a mess of help to stand alone

I need a spark by a fire
To stop the cold of my winter
I need a burst of your raindrops
To keep a flow in my river
I need a call for my phone will ring
I need your song for my voice will sing

Please realize
I'm not half alive

To lead todays to tomorrows
I need your strength to lock me to the track
I need your trust to bust the things I lack

Mystic maiden's more than soft and sexy
She can mess my mind with the stuff that she knows
Her new found beauty goes beyond her covering
And sets a flame in her soul

Grips the goal that eluded her soul
Direction bringing her to nowÕs tomorrow

I am that, thou art that, and all this is that
I am that, thou art that, all this is that
I am that, thou art that, all this is that
This is that

Oooo

Daybreak and I take a glide
Into the pool of peace inside
Two waves travel by
Two waves and I both travel by
And that makes all the difference to me

Life supporting waves of bliss
Mother Divine's precious kiss
Brings with love the light of wisdom
And the gift of eternal freedom

Two waves and I both travel by
And the nature of man
And that makes all the difference to me
Krishna

All this is that
I am that, thou art that, all this is that
I am that, thou art that, all this is that
This is that
This is that

Dusk time the shadows fall
Into the timeless time of all

Two waves and I both travel by

Golden auras glow around you
Omnipresent love surrounds you
Wisdom warming as the sun
You and I are truly one

Two waves and I both travel by
And that makes all the difference to me

I am that, thou art that, all this is that
I am that, thou art that, all this is that
I am that, thou art that, all this is that
I am that, thou art that, all this is that
I am that, thou art that, all this is that
I am that, thou art that, all this is that
I am that, thou art that, all this is that

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I have no kicks against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darned fast
And change  the beauty of the melody
Until it sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

I took my loved one over cross the tracks
So she could hear my man a-wailin sax
I must admit they have a rockin band
Man they was blowing like a hurricane

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Way down south they gave a jubilee
I tell you folks they had a jamboree
And drinking beer from a wooden cup
The folks a-dancin got all shook up

They started playing that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat you can't lose it
Any old way you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me

Say if you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
It's gotta be some of that
If you wanna dance with me


Fun is in
It's no sin
It's that time again
To shed your load
Hit the road
On the run again
Summer skies
In our eyes
And a warmer sun
It's one for all
All for one
All for all out fun

Gotta go to it
Gonna go through it
Gotta get with it

Lookin good
Down the hood
Of a funky ride
On the way
To the tide
Just to tan your hide
In the shade
Lemonade
In the sun ocean spray
To get your face
In the race
Or lay back's no disgrace

Gotta go to it
Gonna go through it
Gotta get with it

It's OK to get out there and
Have some fun
By yourself maybe
Or else with a special one.
Good or bad
Glad or sad
I'ts all gonna pass
So it's OK
Let's all play
And enjoy it while it lasts

Gotta go to it
Gonna go through it
Gotta get with it

Find a ride
Find a ride
Find a ride In the sum-sum-summertime dit dit
Find a ride In the sum-sum-summertime dit dit
Find a ride In the sum-sum-summertime dit dit
Find a ride In the sum-sum-summertime dit dit

Had to phone ya
Had to phone ya just to talk to you
Had to phone ya just to tell ya I was missing you

It lifts my spirits every single time
Sometimes you're busy for awhile
But when you get through
It makes me smile

A-when I phone ya
California's not so far away
You're not alone yaÕ know IÕm only just a dial away

I visualize that you're looking fine
Feels so good when you come on the line

You you you you you you you you
You you you you you you you you
You you you you you you you you
You you you you you you

Come on
Come on and answer the phone
Come on come on
I hope your home
Come on and answer the phone
Come on come on
I hope your home
Come on and answer the phone
Come on come on

Come on and answer the phone
Come on come on

Come on and answer the phone
Come on come on
I hope your home
Come on and answer the phone
Come on come on
Hello, hey Brian!
I hope your home


Well back in time with just a rhythm and rhyme
Gregorian chants were a real big thing
They took that chant and added harmony
It was a different sound
But had the same meaning

I know I know I know I know
It took us a long while
To go to go to go to go
And find us a rock style
I know I know I know I know
That we can take it one more mile

Because
We're singing that same song
We're still singing that same song
We're singing that same song
That same song
That same song

The rock of ages
Built that rockin sound
'Til more and more people start to come around
They worshipped in church
And built that great big choir
It grew and it grew
Until it spread like fire

I know I know I know I know
It took us a long while
To go to go to go to go
And find us a rock style
I know I know I know I know
That we can take it one more mile

Because
We're singing that same song
We're still singing that same song
We're singing that same song
That same song
That same song

Same song 
Oh yeah
Same song 
Oh yeah
Same song that same song

Same song 
Oh yeah
Same song 
Oh yeah
Same song that same song


The flame of love we had has finally died
Can't take this emptiness it left inside
It's over now

And though I played the role I lost my soul
It's still within your heart
It's over now
It's over now
Shades of blue and purple haunt me

The noise outside my window carries on
Like distant bugles love is very gone
It's over now

It took a part of me, the heart of me
To watch it fade away
It's over now
It's over now
Shades of blue and purple haunt me

Heaven
Heaven is far away
Angels no longer play

I need to take this fear and force it down
And just pretend that you are not around
It's over now

I'll put a Frank Sinatra album on
And cry my blues away
It's over now
It's over now
Shades of blue and purple haunt me


Time for supper now
Day's been hard and I'm so tired
I feel like eating now
Smell the kitchen now
Hear the maid whistle a tune
My thoughts are fleeting now

Still I dream of it
Of that happy day
When I can say I've fallen in love
And it haunts me so
Like a dream that's
Somehow linked to all the stars above

Young and beautiful
Like a tree that's just been planted
I found life today
I made mistakes today
Will I ever learn the lessons
That all come my way

Still I dream of it
Of that happy day
When I can say I've fallen in love
And it haunts me so
Like a dream that's
Somehow linked to all the stars above

When I was younger
My mother told me
Jesus loved the world
And if that's true then
Why hasn't he helped me to find a girl
And find my world

'Til then I'm just a dreamer
I'm convinced of it
The hypnosis of our minds can take us far away
It's so easy now
You see someone up there high
And heaven's here to stay

Still I dream of it
Of that happy day
When I can say I've fallen in love
And it haunts me so
Like a dream that's
Somehow linked to all the stars above

I'll find my world
I'll find my world
Someday I'll find my world
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah yeah yeah


To get t'you baby I went through the wringer
Ain't gonna let you slip through my fingers
Going to school isn't my fondest desire
But sittin in class you set my soul on fire
God please let us go on this way

All day long I practiced what to say-ay
I think about this game that I like to play-ay
When I leave you I'm so depressed
'Cause you're my only happiness
God please let us go on this way

Seems we have extra-sensory perception
You can send me thoughts I'd have no objection
Now we can fly high in the sky
We'll live forever, we'll never die

God please let us go on this way-ay
God please let us go on
God please let us go on this way-ay
God please let us go on
God please let us go on this way-ay
God please let us go on
God don't let her slip through my fingers
God please let us go on
God please let us go on this way-ay


The night was so young and everything still
The moon shining bright on my window sill
I think of her lips, it chills me inside
And then I think why does she have to hide

Is somebody gonna tell me why she has to hi-i-ide
She's passin it by, she won't even try
To make this love go where it should

The sky's turnin gray, there's clouds overhead
I'm still not asleep, I'm in my bed
I think of her eyes and it makes me sigh
I think of her voice and it makes me cry

Is somebody gonna tell me why she has to lie-i-ie
She'd be so right to hold me tonight
Love was made for her and I

It's three o'clock I go to my sink
I pour some milk and I start to think
Is she asleep or is she awake
And does she think of the love we could make

Wake up, call me baby call me tell me what's on your mi-i-ind
I've got a car and you're not too far
Please let me come over to you

The night was so young and everything still
The moon shining bright on my window sill
I think of her lips, it chills me inside
And then I think why should she hide


I'll bet he's nice
I'll bet he's twice
As nice as me and it makes me cry
'Cause I remember you and I
Please don't tell me if it's true
Because I'm still in love with you
Pretty darlin you my pretty darlin
You pretty darlin you my pretty darlin

I'll bet he's sweet
Bed eh oooo
I'll bet he's neat
Bed eh oooo
I'll bet he's funny and that ain't all
I'll bet he shows you quite a ball
Please don't tell me if it's true
Because I'm still in love with you
Pretty darlin you my pretty darlin
You pretty darlin you my pretty darlin

Baby
Don't you ever tell me that you're leaving
Now that you got me to believe in
You are the sunshine and the flower
Come on and make my every hour

I'll bet he's nice
Bed eh oooo
I'll bet he's twice
Bed eh oooo
As nice as me and it makes me cry
'Cause I remember you and I
Please don't tell me if it's true
Because I'm still in love with you
Pretty darlin you my pretty darlin
You pretty darlin you my pretty darlin

Well it's you
You my darlin


Over the city in an airplane
I can see everything below
The houses they look so tiny
The cars look like dots
We've only got fifteen minutes to go

The clouds in the sky caress my mind so tenderly
The sun shines down on the great big beautiful scene

The sound of the engine fills my ears up
I'm hopin this rainy weather clears up
My lover is waiting at the airport
Soon she'll be kissing me hello

The woman sitting next to me tells me bout her guy
And I tell her all about you and I

Airplane, airplane
Carry me back to her side
Airplane, airplane
I need God as my guide
Down, down on the ground
Can't wait to see her face

a-1, a-2, a-1, 2, 3
I can't wait can't wait
To see her face
I can't wait can't wait
To see her face
I can't wait can't wait
To see her face
I can't wait can't wait
To see her face
I can't wait can't wait
To see her face
I can't wait can't wait
To see her face

To warm up and give it our best
And beat all the rest
The girls in the stands and all of our fans

We're for our team yeah
You'll never lose it
With us you're still number one

May even treat you like a movie star
And no matter what he ever do for you
He can never love you like I can do
So if I leave her and you leave him

Boardwalk

 

Ah when the sun beats down and burns the tar up on the roof

And the street's so hot you're hoping this whole town is fireproof

 

Under the boardwalk

Down by the sea oh yeah

I'm on a blanket with my baby

That's where I'll be

 

And when the sun goes down

We'll take a walk along the strand

And as the tide goes out

We'll write "I love you" right there in the sand

 

Oh I want to go

Under the boardwalk

Down by the sea oh yeah

I'm on a blanket with my baby

That's where I'll be

 

Under the boardwalk

Under the boardwalk

 

Oh oh ohhhh

Under the boardwalk yeah

Down by the sea oh yeah

I'm on a blanket with my baby

That's where I'll be

 

And when the moon is out

And it's finally cooling down

Don't have to look too far

Because my girl and I just might be found

 

Oh oh ohhhh

Under the boardwalk yeah

Down by the sea oh yeah

On a blanket with my baby

Darling I'm lost without you

Sad with nothing to do

What is it you're doing

What's that mood that's brewing

It's just a matter of time

 

When we went our seperate ways for the first time

I was sure that it would be the last time

 

Whoa darling

I'm waiting for you

Sad with nothing to do

It's just a matter of time

 

It's just a matter of time
