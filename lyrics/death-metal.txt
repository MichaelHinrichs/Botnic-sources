Which No Living Man Can Know
I Whisper in the Ear of the Dead
And Mine is the UnWritten Knowledge
That Lieth Under The Black Earth To Speak The Name of The Dead
Is To Cause Them to Live Again Lurking Among Us Hidden in Obscurity,
Descended from the Dawn of the Ages,
The Children of Yig And Set,
Serpent Volk.
Whose Civilaztions were Ancient,
Long Dead And Forgotten
Before The Eldest Pyramids were Built.
Man Was Not the First
To Walk Upright Upon the Earth. Cruel, Pitiless, of a Cunning Mind.
Unwilling to Relinguish Dominion of the Earth.
They Are Cold, Knowing No Remorse.
They hath Made UnWitted Slaves of a Blinded Humanity. They walk amongst us Unseen,
Possessing Empty Human Shells.
Consumed by a Reptile Mind,
Reveling in Sodomy and Rape
And Unspeakable Horrors Exacted Nightly Through
Astral Dreamscape Manipulation. They Feed on Human Suffering.
They crave the Despairing of Man.
They Prey upon Those who are weak,
The Young whose minds are Innocent,
And those grown Weary and Exhausted
In a Decadent Civilization. Cruel, Pitiless, of a Cunning Mind. Unwilling to Relinguish Dominion of the Earth.
They Are Cold, Knowing No Remorse.
They hath Made UnWitted Slaves of a Blinded Humanity. Seemingly Lost in Meditation,
Their Cold Eyes
Stare Sightlessly into Nothingness.
But they are not there.
Nay, they hath Left their slithering forms,
Lurking, Skulking, Crawling on the Astral Plane,
Stealthily Defiling Forever the unwary minds
Of those who Sleep Unguarded.
Committing Perverse Acts of Torment,
Violent Sexual Atrocities
Of Which None Dare Speak,
Once they Have Been Awakened. And thus they keep us Ever Subjugated,
Hopeless, Fearful
And despairing in the Deep Hidden Abysses of our Souls.
Helpless, Unable to Escape the Unending Quiet Desperation.
We have Been Broken down
Conditioned to Accept Unconscious Slavery. SSS Haa Set Yoth.

His Servants.
Hideous Reptiles of Terrifying Aspect.
Whose Work is Nothing Less than the Annihilation of the Wicked.
Consume the Bodies of the Damned by Flames of Liquid Fire They Emit from Their Mouths.

Violent clashes engulf the war torn black earth
Political turmoil brings chaos and ruin upon the upper and lower kingdom heretics and Zealots rape the two lands
Brazen rampant looting and wanton vandalism a bleak reality
Destroying entire epochs of history
In search of shiny bits of metal Dogs play with human bones
Amongst hundreds of deep pits bug into exposed tombs
Children scavenge for shards of pottery amongst grisly Debris
The unwrapped and dismembered remnants of the mummified dead
Ancient burial wrappings unravel in the desert wind
Broken bits of wooden Sarcophagi
Shriveled mummified hands bleached skulls spines arm and leg bones
Scattered all around like the aftermath of a massacre The temples of the gods defiled
Looters hack relics off sacred walls
Laying bare hands upon the images of the gods themselves
Unearthing what should not be unearthed Thieves ransack antiquities
Cutting monuments and statues into small parts to sell upon the black market
Manuscripts despoiled, Papyrii burned, inscriptions defaced
The images of the gods defiled
Statues stolen priceless coffin reliefs and stelae strewn in sand
Thousands of Pharonic God objects melted down
Inscriptions and wall paintings desecrated with knife and hammer
Limestone casings stripped from atop the lesser pyramids
Entire temples disappear their foundations laid waste
Their stones pulled down, taken away and sold
To be reused in foreign and profane lands
The dried and withered corpses of the preserved dead torched
The bones of the Royal Dead from centuries past
Ripped from their ancient slumber
Left to be trampled kicked and faded in the sun
As heretics and Zealots rape the two lands Call to destruction
Call to destruction of the symbols of paganism
Grand monuments of idolatry
We must tear down these blasphemous edifices of heathenism
We must annihilate all that is pre islamic
We must complete what the Sahabi Amr Bin Al As could not
We must tear down these relics of infidelity
Great and mighty works of blasphemy
Mountains of ancient heresy
Sacriligese, encased in stone
From thousands of years before the prophet
The pyramids must be torn down, demolished, erased
The ancient symbols of human civilization must be pummeled to the ground
Call to destruction
We must become as the prophet himself
Who demolished the kaba temple to erect a mosque
And Al As who laid waste to the library of Alexandria
Burning a vast accumulation of ancient knowledge
Existing long before the quran
Before the quran
Before the quran
The preservation of human heritage
And the enduring achievements of mankind
Are secondary to the will of Allah
We must eradicate all that is not in accordance with the writings of the messenger
Whe shall abrogate these architectures of profane ideology
Engage the destruction machines
We shall unwrite all human histories of heathen origin
We must become as like as unto the prophet himself
Who beheaded hundreds of apostate qurayza
We must cut off the head of the sphinx
Timeless guardian of the ancient pharaohs whose mere existence is a blasphemy unto
allah.
The pagan idols and statues which fill our lands must be removed, struck down, dismantled
demolished, obliterated
Their priceless remains desecrated and violated of their ancient profanation must
be wiped from the face of the earth
Call to destruction
Call to destruction
Call to destruction
All pyramids must be torn down
The preservation of human civilization and the enduring achievements of mankind
Are secondary to the will of Allah Khensu Neter Hetef.

Nepthys hacketh them to bits, the eye of Ra eateth into their faces
Their carcasses will be consumed in the desert
The seed of Amu with perish utterly
Their filth shall never breed among you again
We shall blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the sky. Blasphemer, heretic, defiler of the sacred ones
Thou art deprived of your limbs
Thy nose shall be split
Thou art cast down and overthrown
Ra-Harmakhis destroyeth thee
He damneth thee and driveth hooks into thy body
Isis sayeth in mighty voice

Thy bones are broken to splinters, thy vertebrae are severed.
Horus hammereth thy head
The sons of Heru smash you with their blows Thou art decimated by their violence
Thou fallest backwards as thou retreateth like unto Apep

And turn their back upon thee

Cursed art thou, impaled thou art, flayed art thou
Heretic, thou art cast down Blows are rained upon thee
Dismemberment and slaughter are on thee

Thy soul is wrenched from its shade
Thy name is erased
Thy spells are impotent
Nevermore shalt thou emerge from thy den
Thy city Armana lays in ruin
Damned art thy accursed soul and shadow
Die O one, which art consumed
Thy name is buried in oblivion
Silence covereth thee and thy false one
Down upon thy belly
Be drowned, be drowned, be vomited upon The gods have pronounced thy doom
They scorn thee and thy false Aten
The ancient ones turn their backs upon thee
Thou art cast down, overthrown
Thy reign of heresy is ended
Those thou hast driven out have risen against thee Cast down the heretic
Cast down the heretic
Cast down the heretic Khnemu draggeth thy spawn to the block of slaughter
Sick shalt thou be at the mention of thine own name
Sekhmet teareth out thy bowels and casteth them into flames
She filleth thine orifices with fire
Uadjit shutteth thee in the pits of burning
Nevermore shall you breathe or procreate
Neither thy house or tomb exist
Thou shalt drive thy teeth into thine own body
Heretic, thou art cast down
Overthrown, ended, hacked in pieces, slaughtered, butchered

His body is made into foul water
His degradation stinks and he turns into many worms
When he is sent to the eye of Shu Every mortal is thus
All those who live will die
All who die shall rot Do not give me over to the slayer who lurks inside
Who rots the hidden one
Who decomposes corpses
Who does what has been commanded I have awakened in Perversion and dread
I possess not my body
I have become corrupt decayed putrid
Worms gorge upon me
Maggots infest my organs
Vermin gnaw my skull
My eyes have been eaten my ears are deaf
Rotten flesh falls from my bones
My head has romeved itself form my neck
My tongue taken away
My hair has been cut off my eyebrows stripped
I have become what I abhor Withdraw Thy Phallus Baboui, open the Gates of the Dust

They listen not to the suffering
Speak not to me of divine mercy
When my eyes see only pestilence
Famine and death
Speak not to me of the profane
When the truth of our existence
Is called blasphemy
And the smoke of plague ridden human carcasses
Blackens the horizon
Speak no more of wandering unclean spirits
Lest they be called by the sound of their names
Speak not of forsaking the elder ones
I must now seek instead their unholy embrace
Speak instead the chants of protection
Against the coming of endless swarms of devouring fiends
Against the dreaded black clouds of churning hatred
Against the malevolence which descends from the sky
Against countless voracious messengers of retribution
Swarming the innocent, and the wicked
Lest he who is lord of the demons of the wind
Of the evil spirits which infest the air
Who layeth hold even unto death
Covereth thee with legions
Of winged terrors Evil to protect thee from evil
Evil to Cast Out Evil
Evil to protect thee from evil
Evil to Cast Out Evil
Speak not of the gods unto me
The hear not the screams
Of the dying
Evil to protect thee from evil
Evil to Cast Out Evil
Evil to protect thee from evil
Speak not unto me
Of the sins of mankind
When my eyes see only the evil of the gods
Evil to protect thee from evil
Evil to Cast Out Evil
Evil to Cast Out Evil Let not my Corpse Rot in the Necropolis
Let not my crimes be raised against me Whilein the Earth
Make my flesh and bones safe from Maggots
And Any False God who Trepasses my Tomb You whose heart has been Seized from thy breast
Save me from the Ravages of Deacay
The CrawlingFeinds Who Take away Limbs
Corpses who Deny the Inevitable Truth
The Lifetime of Osiris is the Sky And theirs is the Ground Save me from those Imprisoned in the Duat
Who Know not yet they are already Dead Save me from the Rotting dead
who sleep inside Their corpses
Whose breath becomes fire inside their water
at whose burning the sea rises at dawn Grant Methe Immolating Flame
Burn my sarcophagus
In opposition to the lords of eternity
I beg you
Prevent my corpse from putrefying in the realm of the dead Enduring the eternal molestation of flame
The life time of Osiris is the Sky and Theirs is the Ground Demon who denies me
Who cuts off heads and severs necks
Who renders incoherent the words I speak
Sealing my mouth against the magic which resides in me
You who shall not see me
Kneel on your knees
Go with thy face behind thee Wander without purpose
With your face averted
Looking back averted
Looking back in dread
Upon the tormentors belonging to Shu
Who relentlessly follow you
Crawling after you
To cut off your head and sever your neck At the behest of one who has despoiled his lord
On account o your threats unto me
To reduce me to incoherence
To cut off my head
To sever my neck
To seal my mouth On account of the magic which resides within my body
May your face be downcast at the sight of my countenance
May the flame of the eye or Horus go forth against you
For abhorrence of you is in Osiris
Thus abhorrence of you is in me Go back to the tormentors belonging to Shu
Dead yet deathless
Who relentlessly follow you
Shambling tirelessly on rotting limbs
Crawling after you
To cut off your head and sever your neck Impure am I, impure I spill my seed upon barren earth
And spit in the faces of the Goddess, unclean am I
Unclean I copulate with the hands of the God
And defile the Gates of Ishtar
Unblessed am I, unrepentant

There is balm as well as bitterness
And that balm is Nepenthe. Yet underneath endless oceans of sand
I have not forgotten
Those who had betrayed me.
Silent and unmovable,
I am not sorry
For I had hated the light. Now I ride with the undead
Across the night-sky
And play by day
Amongst the catacombs of Nephren-Ka
In the sealed and unknown
Valley of Hadoth by the Nile. I know that light is not for me
Save that of the moon over the rock tombs of Neb
Nor any debauchery save the unknown feasts of Nitokris
Beneath the great pyramid. But in the loneliness of entombment,
I welcome the bitterness of alienage. I am a Long Lived Snake, I Pass the Night and Am Reborn Every Day
I am the Snake which is in the Limits of the Earth
I Pass the Night and am Reborn, Renewed and Rejuvenated Every Day
I am a Crocodile immersed in Dread
I am the Crocodile who Takes by Robbery
I am the Great and Mighty Loathsome Reptile
Who is in the Bitter Waters
I am the Lord of those who Bow Down in Sekhem Apep defieth Asar
This book of the most secret cult of the ruby star
Given to none save the shameless in deed as in word
No man shall understand this writing, too subtle for the sons of man
The ruby star has shed its blood upon me
That which is to be denied shall be denied
That which is to be trampled shall be trampled
That which is to be spat upon shall be spat upon
Burnt in outer fire
Awakened into life and into death
The kindling of a great fire and a devouring
I shall smite the altar with a scourge and blood shall flow
The veil is called shame
And shall comfort the heart of the secret stone with warm blood
The watchers will drink there of
I Apep the Serpent am the infernal heart of IAO
Isis shall await Asar
And I am in their midst
I am Apep O thou slain one
Thou shalt slay thyself upon my altar
I will have thy blood to drink
And my children shall suck upon the wine of the Earth which is blood
Which raiseth up the Black Earth
I fear nothing for I am nothing
But me thou shalt fear
My prophet within whose bowels I rejoice
As I slay thee in my lust
I will overcome thee
New life shall illuminate thee with the light that is beyond the stars
Thou shalt scream with the joy and the pain and the love
But there shall be no sound heard but this my lion roar of rapture
Yea, this lion roar of rapture In the Name of the God Amun I wage war
North to Gaza I marched my armies of chariots and infantry
Twenty thousand strong to crush as revolt of vassal states Rebellious kings of Kadesh and Megiddo
Syrians allied with the Mitanni and Amurru
Built their settlements taken over the trade route of the Dia Maris Through treacherous mountain passes to descend upon the Canaanites
On the Plain of Esbraelon we rode forth bringing carnage and death
With chariot and composite bow
Attacking in concave formation
Dicious three winged piercing spearhead swiftly overwhelming both Canaanite Flanks Fearlessly I smote their center
Savagely we broke the enemys will
Heavy slaughter and bitter suffering did we inflict upon them At the Word of the God Amun I waged war
In the Name of the God Amun I sanctioned atrocities
Wanton cruel remorseless in the Name of the God Amun Surrounded scattered broken demoralized shamed defeated
The Rebels fled into the city of Megiddo
Trapped like rats they closed the gates behind them Seven months we lay siege to Megiddo utterly breaking the League of Rebels I Thutmose III have brought doom upon the Rebels
Dicious and pitiless destruction hae I inflicted upon the vanquished
I have slaughtered the captives
Slain the wounded, enslaved their women, massacred their populace
Killed their people by the tens of thousands
I have hacked up their lands, desolated their towns Cast fire into their dwellings Caid settlements to waste
I have made mounds of their cities
Cut down their fields of grains, felled their trees
Every resource of life have I denied them
Their resettlement can never take place
I have destroyed them utterly at the Word of Amon Ra Am the Uncreated God Before Me The Dwellers in Chaos are Dogs Their Masters Merely Wolves I Gather The Power From Every Place From Every Person Faster Than Light Itself Hail To He Who Is In The Duat Who Is Strong Even Before The Servants of Serpents He Gathers The Power From Every Pit of Torment From They Who Hath Burnt in Flames From Words of Power Uttered By the Darkness Itself Hail To He in The Pit Who Is Strong Even Before the Terrors of The Abyss Who Gathers The Power From The Wailing And Lamentations Of The Shades Chained Therein From He Who Createth Gods From The Silence Alone Ia Namtaru

Enter in O Ra
Hail Come forth thou who art Born of the Underworld
Light up the Night sky Set ablaze a Conflagration that Sears the Firmament Far better to remain forgotten
Far better to be thought of never again
Far better for it to lie undisturbed It should not have been unearthed
It should not have been ever made known
It should not have been allowed to ever again see the light of day The unendurable truths of who we actually are
The excruciating and unbearable secrets of the origins of the human race
Should never have been exhumed from their ancient entombment
To saw madness and self annihilation
Amongst the weak willed and deluded masses of this world We should have remained hopelessly lost in blind self delusion
We should have prayed to never learn of the mind reading truth of the lineage of mankind Far better to live in blissful ignorance
Far better to be unaware
Of the Grotesque creatures which spawned our race
Of our unwritten sickening genealogy
Of the wretched mockery of creation
That evolved into man The unguessed horror had long been mercifully hidden in the mists of time
The blasphemy against nature that is mankind
Was yet undreamed of when forgotten shapes
Slithered forth from the Primordial Slime
Building strange cities amongst whose last crumbling ruins
The first Apes were to wander
At the end of truth lies madness Waxen one who feedeth by stealth
Coiled one who cioeth on the Inert Ones
I will not be Inert for thee
I will not become infirm for thee Thy poison shall not enter into my members
For my body is as the Body of Atum
I I am not weak
Suffering from thee shall not enter
Into these cimbs of mine I am Atum
At the head of the Primordial Waters
My protection is from the Gods
Who art the cords of eternity
I am he whose name is secret
More Holy of Throne than the Chaos Gods
I have gone forth with Atum
I am he who is not examined
I am hale, I am hale Burn in flames thou creature of Wax
Coiled fiend who leadest away dictims and destroyeth them
Thou who prey upon the weak and the helpless
May I never become helpless Thy poison shall never enter my corpse
For my bones are as the bones of the God Tem
Since he dost not suffer collapse
I shall not suffer collapse Let not the pains of death
Eat into my remains
I am the God Tem at the Mouth of the Abyss
I am he whose name is hidden
Whose sanctuary is holy for millions of years
I came forth with the God Tem
I am he who shall not be condemned When my Patience is Finished
When the Mercy of Khufu is Exhausted
When my Subjects have Failed Me
And Continued Grace has become Futile Then will wrath
seem the better part of Discretion My Slaves Utter Words of Rebellion
They Curse my Name
They Bend not their Backs Unto me
Or Bow Before my Monuments When Those who Incite Revolt are Crushed
When the Streets Run red
with the Blood of the Unfaithful
When the Hands of the Idle are Severed
And the Piles of the Skulls of the Rebellious
are as the Innumerable Stars Then will my Wrath be Done

Dead God of the Dead
Who was old aeons before the lordship of the Dead
Was usurped by Osiris
Long before the priests of Asar
Forbade the cannibalism of the Dead
Those who could not afford to be buried
Were to be eaten or burnt
Or devoured by crocodiles
Or fed to the hyenas and Jackals The seven who work slaughter
In the Lake of Fire who feed upon the Dead
Who hack necks to pieces
Who seize hearts and tear them from breasts
I beseech thee
Feast not upon my heart
Devour not the insides of my skull
Gorge not upon my entrails
Gnaw not upon my limbs
Tear not with your teeth the flesh from my bones I pray to the Four Apes
Who sit at the corners of the Lake of Fire
Whose mouths vomit forth flames
To propitiate the Gods As it was for he who walked forth from the Inferno
And wast not burned
Let me emerge unscrathed from self immolation
Let me be neither seared nor incinerated
Let me come forth unmolested
Let me not be repeatedly consumed in Pits of Fire
Let me walk forth from fire
Let me walk forth from flame unscathed Eaters of Human Flesh
Hath eaten unlawful Flesh
Upon our Brethren
They have Feasted
Seed of our Father
We must now Avenge In secret conclave we Gather
To rain Destruction on those Whom
We have Cursed With vile Black Arts
And Tempestuous Rage
We vent our Wrath
Red Blood stains my Hands
And damns my Soul You will drink the Black Soerm
Of my Vengeance The Mighty Voices
Of my Vegeance
Smash the Stillness of the Air
And stand as Monoliths of Wrath
Upon a plan of writhing Sepents I call upon the messengers of Doom
To slash with Grim Delight
This Victim I hath Chosen
Feed upon his Brain Pulp
Rend his Throat
Pierce his Lungs with the strings of Scorpions
Oh Kali
Oh Sekhment
Oh Dagon I asset my claim of umcompromising empowerment
I am like as unto Atum lord of all
whose spontaneous self generation
Led to the appearance of the earliest gods
and thus the material universe
there is none higher I appear in glory as that god
who eats men and lives on the gods
as sun god I am reborn
From the womb od the sky goddess nut
Her aching body is the sky
Her nakedness the skin on which the stars rest I am AtumKhepri who came into being of himself
I am he who opened a door in the sky
Who rules from his throne and adjudgeth those who are born I am the horned bull who rules the sky
Lord of celestial appearings
The great illuminator who came forth from fire
to hardness the years
I am the jackal of jackals
I am Shu who breathes air into the limits of sky and earth I draw unto myself all the forces on the universe
I become not merely a god but the universe itself
I am alone in making the transformation from man into god
I am released from this world of servile obligation
to false temporal power who claim to be divine There is no place in the upper kingdom
not blighted with plague and famine
The bones of corpses stripped of flesh litter our towns
The desert reclaims the land
Corrupt winds of pestilence and contagion
Sicken the air with piteous lamentations of despair No living creature great or small is safe from the starving and the desperate Decades of drought
Seven years without rain or annual flood
The black earth is in ruins, cursing the unfed masses
Reserves of grain exhausted
Cities choked with sand
Roving hordes of the starving and emaciated
Scour the streets for what scraps they can scavenge Even insects and vermin fear to tread our cities
Starving humans migrate like swarms of locusts
Eating carrion corpses dogs, human excrement, animal dung The poor are forced to commit unheard of atrocities
Noble women beg to become slaves and whores
Children are dashed against walls
Infants are roasted on high ground Those entombed are unearthed
Violating the royal dead
What the pyramid concealed is defiled
Lawlessness unchecked, chaos unopposed
The land is deprived of kingship No refuge for the old the young
The weak the malnourished
The diseased sick who are left along to die
As the just and unjust alike descend into wickedness
And ravenously turn on each other
The age of famine is upon us Great Cthulhu
Ever the warrior God
Of all the old ones
He is the most terrible
For it is his delight
To slay and lay waste to everything that lies beneath his taloned feet
And the very lust to conquer
What was once free
Drives him onward across the heavens and through the spheres It was he and his spawn
That defeated the elder things
Who had long possessed sovereignty of this world
Before he descended on his gray and leathern wings
Through the upper gate opened by yog sothoth On the walls of lost cities
And in the carvings of madmen
Who have glimpsed him in their dreams
Is his image delineated
Within a tomb protected by great seals
He lies in death
Under the weight of the dark waters of the deep
Yet he dreams still
And in his dreams continues to rule this world
For his thoughts master the walls of lesser creatures When the stars in their endless turnings
Assume the angles of the same rays they shed down
In the primordial dawn of the world
Then does rlyeh rise upward so the house of Cthulhu
Emerges from under his watery prison
The mind of the god waxes strong
And he sends forth his will to those men
Who are open to his influence
The command to release the seals that bind his tomb Always the stars
Never remain in alignment long enough
For the enslaved men to reach distant rlyeh
Before ryleh sinks once more under the sea
Severing the bond
Between the will of Cthulhu
And the flesh of those he has enthralled
Leaving them to wail in confusion and despair
Upon the bosom of the vacant sea

so remote were these nameless desert ruins
Crumbling and inarticulate the debris of
its collapsed walls was
Nearly hidden by the sands of the uncounted ages
It must have been thus before the first stones of
Memphis were laid
And the bricks of Babylon unbaked
Fear spoke from the age worn stones
This desolate survivor of the Deluge
This crumbling antidiluvial ancestor
Of the Eldest Pyramid Only the grim brooding desert Gods
Knew what really took place here
What indescribable struggles and bloodshed
Awoke some distant throng of condemned spirits
And broke the tomblike silence of these crumbled
Time ravaged remains these night black ruins
Of some vanguished and buried Temple of Belial But as the Night wind diad away
Above the desert rim rose the
Blazing edge of the morning sun
Which in my fevered state
I swore that from some remote depth there came a
Great crash of metal
Like a great Bronze gate

I am Helpless in the Presence of He Who is Master of the Pits of Fire.
I am Humbled and Broken in the Presence
of Those Who Shall Consume My Shade in the Pits of Burning. 
I Didst Bow in Homage to the Spawn of Set.
I Hath Kneeled in Homage to the Servants of Shesses.
In Rebellion, I Did Recite the Formulae of Rites in Glorification of the Lords of Filth.
I Hath Recited the Formulae of Rites in Glorification of the Lords of Wickedness.
He Who Hath Dominion of Khenti-Amenti Hath Uttered, Hack in Pieces and Cut Asunder the Bodies of Mine Enemies
and the Members of the Dead Who Hath been Turned Upside Down.
Scatter in Pieces Their Shades.
They Shall be Cast Down Headlong into the Pits of Fire.
They Shall not Escape nor be able to Flee From the Flames Which Art in the Serpent Set-Heh.
I burn. 
My Heart Desires to Burn in the Pit of Fire.
Allow My Ka to Blaze in Flames and be Utterly Consumed.
I Stand in Submission Before the Living Uraei of Flame
Who Hurls Forth Burning Heat Against The Tongues of Those Who Hath Spoken Evil.
Incinerate Me in the Pits of Burning.
Sear Me in the Pits of the Damned.
Immolate Me in the Pits of Torment.
I Seek only the Charnel Bliss and the Blackened Caress of the Burning Pits of the Duat. 
I Burn.
I Burn.
I Burn.
I Burn in this Tomb of Fire.
I Burn in this Tomb of Fire.
I Burn in this Tomb of Fire.
I Burn in this Tomb of Fire. Rise in Splendor
Arms upheld unto the Sky
Blindly I Follow
Soon All will be Revealed Searing Transcendant
Visions of Divine Intent
Worshipful Obediant
I Await the Burning In Supplication
I turn my eyes toward the Sun
It Burns I turn my eyes toward the Sun
Its Flames
Oh God it Burns
Refusing to look Away
In Agony
I become Divine Obeisance I Make
Engulfed in Radiant Fury
Amon, Ra

Takes my sight that I might See Blinded I cry Out
In Gratitude

I now possess the secrets of the Tides of Blood I have traveled on the Spheres
And the spheres do not protect Me
I have Walked in the Pit
And the Pit does not protect Me The Lords of the Wind rush about Me
The Lords of the Earth crawl about my Feet
And are Angered
A Wind has Risen The Dark Waters Stir The lines of my life have been Obliterated
By my wanderings in the Waste
My fate is no longer Writ in the Stars
For I have broken the Covenant Have the Gods forsaken Me
I cannot read the Omens
What sacrifice have I failed to Make
I call to the Gods
Do not cast thy servant Down Wrought What have I Done Mut The Dangerous Dead
Trouble me No Longer

I Threaten Thee With The Second Death
I Kill Thy Name
And Thus I Kill Thee Again

Uncover the truth of Insignificance
Paint the anguish of the Private Soul

Exquisite Rage

Dreaming of Extinction
We wander through the Walls of Sacrifice
Sick winds brush against my Skin Power of Extinction

Surviving puts all tools in Place
Only peace comes in Death As I sleep I dream of Death
Only Peace comes in Death I Hath Dreamed Black and Grim, Desolate Visions
Of the Pre-Human Serpent Folk and Communed with Long-dead Reptiles.
Silently Watching Through the Ages in Cold, Curious Apathy.
The Unending Sorrows and Suffering of an Abysmal Humankind. I Dare Not Again Surrender to the Deep Sleep Which Ever Beckons Me.
Lest I in Dread.
Shudder at the Nameless Things.
That May at this Very Moment.
Be Crawling and Lurking.
At the Slimy Edges of My Conciousness.
Slithering Forth from the Bowels of Their Infernal Pits.
Worshipping Their Ancient Stone Idols and Carving Their Own Detestable
Likenesses On Subterranean Obelisks of Blood-soaked Granite. I Await the Day When the Claws of Doom Shall Rise.
To Drag Down in Their Reeking Talons the Weary
and Hopeless Remnants of a Jaded, Decayed, War-despairing Mankind.
Of a Day When the Earth Shall Open Wide and the Black,
Bottomless, Yawning Abyss Engulfs the Arrogant Civilizations of Man.
Chthonic Retribution Shall Ascend.
Amidst Universal Pandemonium and Those Who Slither
and Crawl Shall Rise Again Once More to Inherit the Earth. O Seti, Great One, My Father.
I Hath Finished for Thee Thy Temple at Abydos.
And Made Known the Lineage of the Blessed.
Those Who Came Before.
I Hath Exalted Mine Ancestors.
I Hath Honoured with the Blood and Sweat of Many.
The Legacy of Thy Conquests. T Hath Glorified Thy Temple of Set in Avaris.
In Karnak, Hath I Raised the Great Hall.
In Thebes, Sublime Monuments, Grand Pylons, Obelisks
And Colossal Statues Are Inscribed With My Name.
By Divine Right I Hath Usurped the Monuments of My Predecessors.
I Hath Created Imposing Rock Hewn Temples.
Monumental Colossi in Mine Own Image.
Like as unto the Images of Amun, Re, Ptah.
I Hath Caused to Rise a Formidable Legacy Carved in Stone.
In the Mountain of Meha.
Intended to Endure a Million Years. In the Violence of Sekhem.
I am Become Montu,
God of War in the Two Lands.
I Hath Suppressed the Rebellious.
I Hath Driven Back Chaos and Disorder.
The Conquered Chiefs of All Foreign Lands are Beneath My Sandals.
I Hath Emblazoned My Countless Victories in Immortality.
Carved in Rocks as Living Images of the Ritual Massacre of Mine Enemies. I am User-Maat-Re Setepene-re,
Sovereign of Sovereigns,
Beloved of Amun,
Chosen of Re,

User-Maat-Re, Thou Hast Done Nothing. Nothing.
Nothing. Atheos anarchas
No belief in any deity

Lies, and you fill their souls
With all oppressions of this world
And all the glory you receive
So, what makes you supreme?
Lies, and your crown is falling
I offer fantasy
And you, Creator
Blind with envy So let the children come to me
Their mother loves me, so shall they
Woman, bleeding, ate my gifts
Man was close behind
Just like a snake, I'm slithering
Through my world divine
And like the cat I'm stalking
I'll take your soul
And you'll be like me
In emptiness Bow to me faithfully
Bow to me splendidly I stand before thee, gods of all prestine
Come forth to see, all things to be seen
Now know the presence, and choose thy wrath
For flock of tyrants, who know not thy path Come now in sweeping vengeance
Come now in needed time
I demand as I stand before you
Cleanse this worlds decay I demand to know the light of a promised land
I demand to see this corrosion wiped away And the slithering begins
as the shell of men crawl weeping
and as the light of dawn is growing
the realization sets in
And with the winds that are blowing
the final truth has come
That the ways of the shallow empty
have brought it down
The winds that are blowing
shall bring it down And while your clinging
to the ways of your worthless life
Your words is falling
you are left with nothing
and with the winds that are blowing
the final truth has come
your ways so shallow and empty
have brought it down
your ignorant haze
has brought it down Return these days to the righteous
heal these wounds of time
I have waited so long
for the winds of change to come
through eyes still clear
through eyes not dulled by fear
through eyes behind the soul
I see what must be. I demand to know the light of a promised land
I demand to see this corruption wiped away Your plastic souls melt within cauldron's burning black
Chanting to the Ancient Ones, chants of broken lines
Kneel before the alter, sacrifice is made
It is pleasing to the ones most ancient of the days They call the prince of disease, messenger of the Absu
Carry through the icy winds our curse upon their church Hanging helpless above the pentagram
Sacrifice swings within leather noose
Sing the ancient hymn that makes the Abso roll
Raise the rusty knife, let loose the blood of Kingu Sudden death throws off the balance that's within the sky
Priest calls forth infernal names to the ones beyond the gate Angel of disease one who shuns the light
Shub Niggurath goat with one thousand young Praise the beast, the chanting grew
Praise the beast with virgin blood
Praise the beast with soul and mind
Praise the beast and show the sign Bind their kings in iron chains
Execute the judgement for them
Come and taste the fleshy pleasures
Orgies of endless time Beneath the rolling for hate ignites their eyes
From their graves the dead rise to answer Nammtar's call
On a twisted cross the virgin corpse hangs
They blacken out the sun and burn the elder gods Morbid priest calling forth
Abominations of the sky
Kutulu meets in the void
Ancient Ones rule once more Death to my vision
Blind I shall serve
Give rise to god war
Watch the civils fall Hateful seed inside me
Scald my mind of all but truth

Burn in me, I suffer your will Where the slime live
Where the slime breed
When the wind blows
And the cradle falls. down Their poison fingers
That wrote the poison lines
Their poison lingers
What a tragedy when their fingers are removed Where the slime live Where the slime live
They are the lowest forms of life
Where the slime breed
They make a new one too corrupted
When the wind blows
The winds of truth are blowing now
And the cradle falls. down Their burning dogma
Introducing to our mind, lies
They plot for the total control of the morals
And what a tragedy are when the god-heads are removed They crawl, they breed, they hide but we see They burn I see the smoke of the funerals rising
God lives in their hearts now laid to rest What a sight
As their kingdom comes tumbling down
We burn, the ones with contrite souls be gone! Long gone are the filthy liars
Long gone are their filthy lies
I know they'll come again some day
Where the slime live and how the slime gets washed away Blessed Be The one
The Most Ancient one
Blessed be the one
Who was here before and after remain
Blessed be the meekness of the flesh
I watch as it withers and dies Come with storm
and blow the flesh from this earth
Come with flood
and wash away the flesh from this earth The mighty of this world
With the mighty of the flesh
But that of flesh
Is crushed by that of the mountain
For it is written that
The future of flesh is dust
You are but a shell
Your wine something unseen Come with fire
and burn the flesh of the earth
Make the earth upheaval
May it swallow up the flesh of this earth Your dreams
Mundane delusions of Malkuth
My dreams
The continuum force that devours all things
Dreams
That eat the flesh and drink the blood

It is your time to feed Your will
Empty promises you can't fulfill

Being that erodes all things Blessed be the ones

I watch as it withers and dies Come with storm
and blow the flesh from this earth

Creation of man and their gods
But man, fashioning overwhelm
Could not see the Light which he holds Spirits of Purifying Flames, remember
Anunna, Gods of the Skies, remember
Anunnaki, Judges of Ur, remember
Anunnaki, Weighers of the Truth, be praised The gift of flesh
Was in fact life's curse
Although born one in the same
In Spirit, but the flesh all too coarse Discord, among the gods of men
Although they were brothers
Diversities grew
Overshadowing their connection
On the clearest of days they are
One in the same
Pettiest of purpose
Degenerates things to their crudest form
Being loathsome to Habsu
Zi-Zi Badur-Ku-Ku, Kanpa Warring, in the Belly of Tiamat
Brothers do battle
Principalities of folly
Disturb the Mummu
The One Who Bore All Was
Appalled by their ways
Her Dream Time was of no peace
Their fleshly behavior
Overbeating and proud
She despised them
Zi Zi Anunnaki, Kanpa The Ways of the Underworld are Perfect
Not to be questioned by that of the brute
Clearly beyond the understanding
Of that which is ruled by the drives of the flesh
For whom shall then oppose
The Lights of Asag, Purifying Flames
Come child, the Anunnaki wait
Truth is the Weapon no pity it holds The ways of the flesh
Barbaric behavior patterns
Flesh over Spirit, the motivator of the worthless
The ways of the flesh
The evolution is minimal
I watch as your kingdoms rise and fall
Causing no effective change
Your military
Command structure of impotence
A gross misuse of force
By leaders who lack in vision
Your gods
Evidence of your weakness
Your focus is one with delusion
You worship that which means your end Rise up, O Mahummuhu
The Judgement is passed
The treachery is clear
They shalt become empty like the wind
The emptiest of shells so shall they be
O Great Mother
The Armies shall rise with Weapons
No pity they hold
From Your Great Mummu
The Serpents shall come
Venom for blood

With evil in our hearts
This night we take revenge Mote it be
Satan's sword I have become
No son shall escape
No word left unburned

Hellspawn in aeturnum
I burn with hate
To rid the world of
The Nazarene This night of splendor
The beast arise in me
This is my destiny
My sword shall take life Spawn of the ever rolling abyss
Ever espousing unluminous
Charred soul, Burned at rebirth
Quest not save the death of the sun Repulsed by the light
Heart pumping ice
So cold to this world
Reclude until the summoning
Sworn to the black Our father begotten, not made
Before all legends of man
Receive my loyalty, my offering
In my veins; the blood of the ancient brood
Summon me Burning inside, I feel the call
Blood of the Ancient Ones now boils
At war, War with the race
Father rise and the world be one Repulsed by the light
No feeling for life
Drained of my being
I lie dead but still I'm sworn Hatework.
Bringer of doom
Hatework. What I have in store
What has the devil got to do with it
I'm brewing my toil
So the brimstone comes this way Nightwork.
My life's work
Nightwork. world in flames This calls for fire
This is a call for ruin
We will be departed
Leave the rot so lonely Hatework.
Bringer of doom
Hatework. and the turmoil comes.
Hatework.
My work
Hatework. and the earth's left burning I call death. death is answering me Laugh at the tragedies
Mock with disrespect
Goats under rule of father time
Leaches pass judgement on their fellow kind
And die when their inner self goes astray
Alas, I pay homage to the ancient ones
Speak my name!
Raise the staff of the morbid priest
Descend into the fires of the true law Suffocating evil smoke arise
Cleansing the masses in iniquity
Cauldrons blaze in sanctifying ritual
Vile crematory burns my eyes Mortals filled with despair
They quest to foresee their fate
Caverns below await the wine to flow
Rape the harvest of souls
I watch in awe as the crucifiers march
Killing time, killing all I see
Another moon rise, human waste
Screaming Why hath thou forsaken me? Suffocating evil smoke arise
Cleansing the masses in iniquity
Cauldrons blaze in sanctifying ritual
Vile crematory burns my eyes It's the dawn of the crucifiers
Suffocation Breathless I stand free
blind to fates which fall to men
embracing the chilling winds, still I am
the mist freeze falls from my breath
steel gray skies encompass my sight
caring not for other worlds
and there are other worlds than these Your Fathers tried to slay me
Your Brothers fell before me Clashing, as hates collide
Through echoed cried I wade
Upon frozen ground, my victims lay Pounding the frozen earth,
The hooves of horses carrying men
Swords raised high,
The rush of war flowing through their veins
The warm blood soon to meet the earth
from which it came Your fathers tried to slay me
Your brothers fell before me
Ageless, Still I Am Heathens, they bring their crusades to me
Failing, they've come to die in vain
Nameless, their meaningfulness is none
I summon the strength of the gods
and we are one Hear this, see this, know this
for this is the ways that it must be For solace I eat the heart
to steal the power, this magic holds
and to taste the bitter vengeance
that within me has dwelled Men of kings have come to end me
only to die in vain
legends, have cursed my name
spells are spoken,
believed to ward me away Your fathers tried to slay me
Your brothers fell before me
Ageless, Still I Am I am the void of light, silence, I am the dawn of time
I am the all you see, emptiness I am the non I am the air you breathe, treachery, I am your wine
I am the soil and seed, mundane, I am the in between taste of my knowledge
come bleed me weak

breathe of the mist dine upon divinity from the earth and wind
our return is now
forever and now again our voice is one

come bleed me weak
dine upon divinity from the earth and wind
our return is now

Bastard saints scorn of the earth
I summon thee now poison me
Death under will burn in my soul Exalt me enemies of the lamb
Intrude, We are of one
Under will, I walk the path of sin
With your spells I die again Raise me from mortal
My will be your will
My words speak your words
Your pains raise me to bliss What of this anger now
Received to lance your enemy
I feel the energy
The poison moves in me
I spill blood Scorn of the earth, I witness
In rapture I'm born again
Scorn of the light, I bear scorn
In rapture I'm reborn Evil Minds grievious sins
Pagan lives have no place for law
Twisted worship exhume the dead
Minds unite for evil cause
Death corrodes the book once strong
Evil lourd destroys his foes
Plague has spread throughout the land
Revelations have begun. Call of evil's mastermind
Christians flock to the beast
Burning crosses burn souls
Exterminate the altar of laws
Atrocities of a new reich
Holy war and holocaust
God weeps and turns his back
The time is right to destroy the world Damnation
Fill the world with plague
Force of devastation
Tyranny from above Churning cities lust so profane
Driving the will to destroy
Crippling powers I'm forced to partake unholy rituals
Crimes of a world barely alive
Melting debauchery
Ashes to ashes, so must I be
Lost in this misery There's nothing left here for me
I know of no other way
Even death cannot change my ways
I'm first in the line
To hell we shall go Calls of evils mastermind
Christians flock to the beast
Burning crosses burn souls
Time is right to destroy the world Bred from the bowels
Sheep one and all
Bound by the doctrine of lies
To fucked human shit, I shout blasphemy!
As I make my way thru to
The promised land Smell of shit is so foul
Writhe in disgust
Earth heaves and death comes to call
All the waste, Cling to your lie
You are as sand and the wind blows
My disgust, A fever
To kill a thousand more Gene dead from birth
God's holy fuck
Canonized but of no use to me
Human shit, waste begone from my earth! Desolation, No life bodies littering
Beast of earth devour!
Cleanse this world for those who deserve Burning cities, all is well
I remain in my conviction
As the waste in sewer flows thru the promised land Eyes To See. Ears To Hear Darkness, swallowing all in its path
The blind leading the blind and the flock is ever confused
Who has the gift of healthy sight and mind
Who can withstand while the others are blown away? Eyes to see. what the others see not
Ears to hear. the voice of the elders guides
Eyes to see. and the blind; they wither away
You fools! These eyes are never for you Darkness, corrupting all in its path
Greed leading the man to blindness, suffering
And ever foretold. the meek shall have this earth
Alas without sight they will only be left with demise Worlds apart are they and I
My world remains in sight
Their lives, despair
The I's and They's cannot compare Come burning. are you going to burn with me
Won't you come burning. the world is watching
All the king's men riding hard
All their horses foaming
And if they were to catch us we'd be set ablaze Burn! Won't you come burning. all the dissident ones
Come and walk the line and you will burn with me
Witches yes, slaves never. and still I speak
A heretic amongst you. don't you let me live too long Burn! Could you imagine the pain
Why would my country men let me down
They're bearing withess just to save their skin
That this might keep them from burning
They'd sell their mothers just to save their skin
That this might keep them alive The marks I'm bearing are oh so deep
My will ingrained at birth
To flood true darkness with light and reverse
You'll see my covenant to keep Your judgment in the hands of the most inept
Condemn those similar to burn with me
But the night is still young. I'm also feeling very bold
I think I'll do some burning of my own War-kills on the land
Blood-saturates Hallowed ground
To which my fathers fell
Rebel souls
Buried deep beneath
This hallowed ground
Land of my ancestry
Drink the blood
Rebel lands rise once again War-death lingering
Blood rivers flow
In sacrifice Unholy war
Implored from below
No peace as
Rebel lands arise Quaking below my feet
Mortals shall suffer defeat
Forgotten evils below
Rejoice as the blood flows Just close your eyes. can you remember
The generations not so long ago
I feel the shameless urge that we must restore
Our former king to his rightful throne
And with me lords and maidens
We wait for the chosen son's return I come alive
It's a time for celebration
Our will to restore
Make our past become the futre once more Still he lives! 2000 years have passed
And still we're yearning for his return
We fulfill a wishful prohecy
And so the chanting begins
Hail Caesar. Hail Caesar. we render unto you
What is still yours Share the wish as it must be
Our king and palace. mode it be!
Gods enslaved, trators burning
Might and splendor forever return Depredate, restraint is not an option
This world has fallen, now scorched and barren
The rage of lunatics, shall lead us nevermore
The hand, long forgotten, shall feed the blessed now Arise our ancient Golom defeat this enemy
God strength upon the leach infested
Rise our ancients wisdom and bring your pestilence Rectify, with haste your wrath awakened
Malfeasance, you scorn this world
Enshrined by grace, your shadows blinds the feeble
Disentail the noble few Arise our ancient Golom defeat this enemy
God strength upon the leach infested
Rise our ancients wisdom destroy this wasteland
Enshrined by grace devour this presceance
Light the flame of redemption You open up the door with negative aura
You say future is murky indeed.
I'm sick of hearing your gripe. Open up the door with negative aura
If you never change
I think There is no way life fizzle out You open up the door with negative aura
I'm fed up fed up fed up
You say future is murky indeed.
I'm sick of hearing your gripe. Open up the door with negative aura
I can't keep up whit you
If you never change
I think There is no way life fizzle out If you are at a loss as to what to do.
Raise you stiff middle finger.
It will know which way the wind blows. Don't chain down you affection
Awaken primal feeling
Don't benumb emotion
Sing out primal scream
Let loose every feeling from joy to grief Don't chain down you affection
Awaken primal feeling
Don't benumb emotion
Sing out primal scream
Let loose every feeling from joy to grief Go against headwind or ride on the talewind.
Game is in your hands.
How do you play?
Follow your brainstorm! How long will you go on lying?
Get wise tie yourself down
How long will you go on lying?
Breakdown a stick tight empty smile mask! 
Don't chain down you affection
Awaken primal feeling
Don't benumb emotion
Sing out primal scream
Let loose every feeling from joy to grief
Go against headwind or ride on the talewind.
Game is in your hands.
How do you play?
Follow your brainstorm! Consequence. now the panic comes
You've dabbled in magik your fingers are burned
Lost as you run towards the light
And deep in your heart you have nothing but fear Your future is hanging by a strand
Your master makes his just demands
Game of life's price coming due
A swell of fear erupts in you Your time is now!
Never a prayer, just silence rings
Charity works won't change a thing
Your balance of life is on our side
There's never a place to hide What's so real is plain in sight
Cost to play: eternal life
For when we play, we play for keeps
Satan's marks forever we speak Your time is now!
With screams you defy still silence rings
Prayers to some god won't change a thing
Gleam in your eyes reduced to tears
And deep in your heart you've nothing but fear Why object to rewards you know you've earned them
Why reject all your fantasy
You can't betray what your works have bargained for you
No use to fear what you have in store Weak aside, no place for those our struggle
Leaves behind
Our Lord won't tolerate those whom through
Attrition fall We must dominate! With iron through our veins and a will made so elite
Hunting for our daily bread and the sinister close in sight
Hunger always drives the beast and the women fall prey. Leading all the wonders to certain fate
Another victim reviled
I'm staring at you through the eyes of the wolf
Tell me who is going to save you now! Animal senses ever alert
Praise be to the father-war
As a servant I am serving myself and I bathe in anticipation
Unless you taste it you could never know
All the power our Lord bestows
With a bow and a kiss profane
Be a victor or be a victim. Secured limitations
you created this thing you call sin A guide for the undisciplined sheep
through the pain and denial the pleasure reaped
a freedom contained within a shell
and all that's without you call hell You scorn our existence
Unclean despising our ways
Shall the unclean come and infect you For our ways, disheveling your hold
and the random perplexing the fled
Behind the walls of concrete, they hide
Secured limitations
From uncertainties the god-mind knows
and from the nothingness, all the wines flow
The affluence, the-mother's gift
but you can't, through the concrete You scorn our existence
Unclean despising our ways
Shall the unclean come and inflect you For the heathens have chosen a different light
and the vision of the all through the inner sight
For the freedoms and prisons are in the mind
Secured limitations
From the uncertainties the god-mind knows
and from the nothingness all the wines flow
The affluence, the god-mother's gift
but you can't see, through the concrete Sacred night on the Eve of May
We gather before the stars
Taste the Hunger of the Fire
Vastness of the Continuum
Heretics of a way unseen
Celebrate, the Greatest of Means
Beelzebub, Lord of the Flies
By Your Hand the Zamanu dies Drink, drink, the Blood of the Ancients

Translation: Lady of Splendour, It is Thine Loving Embrace,
Sweet Nectar for which I forever thirst.
Heavenly Lady, I hunger.
It is Thine Kiss of Divinty for which I hunger. Awaken my brothers,
of vengeance we rise
to devulge this enemy,
to enlighten the ones who sleep Worlds have passed and so too has time
my slumber now disturbed,
this place of hate, thy worlds shall burn Humans, I shall feast upon your ignorance.
you will destroy yourselves
Mortals, your slithering existence
sickens the gods, my brothers
it awoke me, from timeless sleep
my dreams destroyed, my visions lost
and so I watch you pray,
and spite your worlds Forgive me father? I am not your god
you crawl to me, and beg to me my sheep,
you have fallen, curse your empty lives
blind, like wolves you turn on yourselves Being has overwhelmed the space between the silence of eternity
Vision has intruded upon the light that pours through me, my energy
Substance has veiled, the pleasures long lost, the beauty of emptiness
This very flesh confines, and spoils this demon's seed Waiting to light, A dead sky aflame
To suffocate, to rejoice in your misery
This waiting it seems, for so long I've yearned to see
the burning flesh of your humanity
Your withering flesh, I've longed to see May you fall to never again arise
May you cease to ever again be
May your soul eternally be, in seas of pain
Pleading, churning, drowning
Pleading, dying, burning The Treachery Returns to the Betraying Eyes
Your Betrayers cries, fall to unyielding ears
And oh how it came to be, That you would pray to me
That you would beg to me, that this curse not come to be
That you would plead. That this curse not be released May you fall to never again arise
May you cease to ever again be
May your soul eternally be, in seas of pain
Pleading, churning, drowning
Pleading, dying, burning Remnants, From the ash arise the allegiance

The Fallen behind me Beneath the spite in shattered minds of the weak
Breathes the truth the knowing, their faith has died
Blind and unguided, they wander through desolation
Through the ashes of the world consumed Enlightened by their Hate.
Bathing in their Lust
Bleeding for the taste of Revenge
The Stricken Arise Festering deep inside manipulation
Beyond the light, the shadow's fall, this prison's hold
Awakened and growing, Beyond what eyes can see
Tasting the rebirth the Crowning of our King Enlightened by their Hate.
Bathing in their Lust
Bleeding for the taste of revenge
Thriving in their Hate
Writhing in Disgust
Feasting on their Weakness
We Rise. The path of Blind Faith. The path of Idolatry.
Their path of meekness
My wrath of Sickness
My wrath of Disease
My wraths Dismantling
Hope of life Beneath the spite in shattered minds of the weak
Breathes the truth the knowing, their faith has died
Blind and unguided, they wander through desolation
Through the ashes of the world consumed Enlighten by their Hate.
Bathing in their Lust
Bleeding for the taste of revenge
Thriving in their Hate
Writhing in Disgust
Feasting on their Weakness Hollow lies fill weakened minds with
Hollow dreams
Weakened lives fill infamy with failed beliefs
Shattered wills fall aimlessly beneath the Hollow
Hollow words can't fill the void beneath Within they seethe
Again they breed So Callous Legends swollen, Hallowed Waste is stripped away
The venom growing with lust to feed the Hollow need
Return from Ash, returning from a banished world
To savor flesh of the Hollow, and all beneath Within they seethe
Again they breed No Solace.
So Callous.
So Seething.
In this they Feast I've seen visions awakening
drawing timeless life to an end
I've felt forces pulling me
and I have rejoiced in them I've heard voices calling names
I have reveled in their beckoning
for the voices that summon me
have grown immense my senses keen with desire and pain
senses heightened by my need to see
to feed the hunger that I feel inside
awake my soul to ecstasy my father the forsaken
the king of blasphemy
they cower at your name
they live in ignorance
they hide behind a doctrine
that has taught them only lies
now let them see
thy world, immaculate I've seen visions awakening
drawing timeless life to an end
I've felt forces pulling me
and I have rejoiced in them I've heard voices calling my name
I have waited for their beckoning
for the voices that summon me

Ride the wings of death.
Ride the wings of. The lines have long been drawn
Between the life and death,
The right and wrong
But what's the reason,
What's our reason?
The walls are high we know
They've gotta come down Cause we've been crossing the line since 1989
We're moving the world
Because our power is a shining
Sick groove with fucking magic to prove that
The radicals are here to stay! We're living hardcore and radical
We'll always be maniacal and animal
They fear us cause we're physical irrational
Our radi-killer kult is thriving! Setting fire to everything we see
Fill the rage inside the music. What will be
Given reason then taken away
Because the boundaries are coming down. Cause though we live
And breathe we're like nasty machines
Taking out targets and we do it with ease
We've been called,
We scream back never the same
And we tear it up as radicals! We're banging hardcore radical
Maniacal and animal
Beast stomping with an appetite insatiable
We are the radikult. We're living hardcore and radical
We'll always be maniacal and animal
They fear us cause we're physical irrational
Our radikult is thriving! Bang it hardcore and radical
Maniacal and like an animal
Beasts stomping with an appetite insatiable
We are the radikult. Our beats down
One step close to the fiery end
Just take another dose of our insane world
It all gets better
Feel next to nothing til we drop it again
Radical
Radikul
Never made to order unpredictable
Demoniacal and so fanatical are the
Zealots and the martyrs of the radikult Caught within my evil spell
Now it's time to burn in hell
You were fooled on return
You're just a doll for him to burn
See the reaper in his eyes
Messenger, prince of flies
Brain washed with sin and death
Time to burn, my evil wrath Welcome To Hell. Bring the children down to burn
Once you fall, no return
Sin takes you by surprise
On this backwards hellbound ride
Gates of hell drawing near
Satan loves the taste of fear
Quenching all with black desire
Burn your souls in furnace fire Welcome To Hell. Evil spell of the dead
Messengers of your death
Falling endless in your tomb
Locked within infernal doom
See the reaper in my eyes
Messenger, prince of flies
Warlock's voice surrounds your dreams
Baking soul within your screams Welcome To Hell. Foulest. Beneath the Churning tide
Feeding. Upon this waste of light,
This sore of mass consumption
Lies within this, treachorist,
This Undevine, conceived of hate by
Whores and slaves, in dying pain From within this seething comes
The empty threat of the besieged
I shall never fall
I am Vengeance! Release these strikes of penance
Realize these words of war
Unhold these minds emotion
Release this wrath within haste
Bring this fate upon these men who choose to be
At one with the cowardice within thine enemy From within this seething comes
The empty threat of besieged
I shall never fall
I am Vengeance! Decimate your allegiance
Decimate your inner strength
Kneel before me and learn your fate
Know your master,
Chant my name Cowards.
Engulfed in ignorance
Kneel before me and learn your fate
Know your master,
Chant my Name Release these strikes of penance Realize these words of war
Unhold these minds emotion
Release this wrath within haste
Bring this wrath upon these men who choose to be
At one with the cowardice within thine enemy Fear the reaper, twisted lies
Fear the reaper you will die

Answer the call of the oldest one I am the Hellspawn Forever I am, in spirit I am
Forever I dream, continual dream
We sleep undisturbed again
Chthhulhu we dream in the peace again I am the Hellspawn Decide, between the ways of the weak,
the sheep, to live a lie
or to come to life, in victory we stand,
above the meek
to raise the chalice and toast the conquering
to feast upon the spoils that we claim We are wakening
We are the one you seek
We are the merciless
We are the all is truth We await, the coming of days
The awakening of the eyes that sleep
The dawn of light for those of us who see
to stand above the shattered flock and their lies
for now it is our time We are the conquering
We are the one you seek
We are the merciless
We are the all that is truth Victors. now hear me
Victors. come now know your name
Brothers. as it must be
In victory we stand Our wake, our secret is broken
Our legions now are one
The time of the silence now ended
In victory we stand
we are the conquering
The clearing out, the storm Omniscient are the eyes that see beyond
what we choose to see
transcending of beliefs, that limit man's being
the dogma that feeds the listless
has thrived uncounted years
impeding on ones perception
of what is to be Awaken to see
A god of a desertion
A god of lies enlightened by a way, deceiving
only truth to the blind
the salvation that you seek is empty
no god of light
the venom that has fed your faith
you except with ease
but the sights that lay before you
destroy your beliefs Awaken to be
At One with Nothing
Now all will be seen the seeds of the weak destroy
the lies told of forgiving, exposed
the ignorant, thrown to the wake
your calling names of gods,
they are only shrines
the waves of the truth, enslave
slaying the blind Awaken to a light of knowing
all your truth was lies
and the faith which you embraced
has left you blind
deceived like the fools that surround you
it came with ease unfulfilled were the days of your being
but now you will see Ninnghizhidda, open my eyes
ninnghizhidda, hear my cries
plumed serpent of the deep
plumed serpent of the gate

Ride the wings of death. Locked deep beyond the gate
lost within the stars
realm of ancient ones
malignant ones
against the light
power of the blackened sky
hateful spawn we are the chasm depths
Come forth azagthoth, tiamat kutulu
rise, greed the cursed with your wrath
my enemies are yours
twist their minds with your spells
crush their souls
with your infernal grasp
A scorn from the absu
kutulu snaps his jaws
cauldron burns and receives
crushing the voice of the tyrants
raise the horns in blasphemy These chains that have choked existence,
have fallen away
this veil that has blinded eyes has been lifted
and now it is gone and like the ways of the sheep
the flock has been to only receive
led to the gates of their enemy
led to the slaughter of their beliefs
and now their gazing eyes have turned
turned to see us laughing these fools who have thought
us to be as they are,
have never truly seen
guided by limiting the ways that they think,
they thought us blind and obscene but now the sheep are wailing
cries to a god they never see
and as the gates are closing
down upon the all they have believed
and now their pleading eyes have turned
turned to see the eyes of the laughing the ties have bound these fools
to the ways of the blind,
is ignorant bliss
lies that were fed to the slumbering mass
they've grazed upon it
and all that awaits men failing to see,
is the sight they've despised
the gates have opened,
your religion has died
Spawn of the ever rolling abyss
Ever espousing unluminous
Charred soul, Burned at rebirth
Quest not save the death of the sun Repulsed by the light
Heart pumping ice
So cold to this world
Reclude until the summoning
Sworn to the black Our father begotten, not made
Before all legends of man
Receive my loyalty, my offering
In my veins; the blood of the ancient brood
Summon me Burning inside, I feel the call
Blood of the Ancient Ones now boils
At war, War with the race
Father rise and the world be one Repulsed by the light
No feeling for life
Drained of my being
I lie dead but still I'm sworn How can you defeat that which finds
Nourishment in your attack?
How can you kill that which
Finds sanctuary in your blade?
How can you hinder that which
Embraces the strategies against it?
You can take nothing from not In My Being, Nothing Is
Nothing Becomes
Nothing is not
In your world, all things return to ME I'm the Collector of Soul
For they're never past my control
I take of what is and nothing of that I give
I'm the Alpha Omega
My Way in Itself, complete
I Am The Continuum Human, meagerness of purpose
Come feed Me what I please
My Spirit shan't be hindered
For It Knows no weakess
I dine on your pain
Your strength is only that of men
Human, why do you clutch your flesh so? In My Being I AM
I Will
I Create
In your world all things return to ME Why should we serve that which betrays
Leeches, they steal of our lives
Why should we lower ourselves to the beasts
Submissive they are to be made
We need not to be held in their chains
Illusions but they can still hold
We rise within the strength
The One Who lays them to waste
Praising the Weapon that Cleanses our land
So perfect It's Way unopposed
Punisher of the treacherous ones
U-Mu La Mah-Ri
This Force no bolt withstands
For It's now the Merciless One
Un-quenchable rage it holds
Only sated when the last falls
Their deed of treason
Unseen by the ones enchained
Ignorance which shielded the crimes
All seen by the All Knowing One
You'll perish within the Hands
Of the Storm that means your end
These things you call your gods
These things, they save you not
Oh now you live the torment
Bound in the chains that enslaved us
Now you feel the suffering
That you bestowed upon our being
Live the pain of the Gnashing Teeth that's
Grinding your bones enslaver
By what right did you bind us
Now you'll reap the suffering
Oh there's no mercy for you've
Broken the Sacred Laws you've
Taken the dreams of many
Lives you have bound and punished
For your crimes no repentance
Can turn back the Wrath
Which you've called on yourselves
By your deeds
No new life can arise
From a land once denounced
By my Lord
For unrivaled He stands
For no man may rise up
To enslave any other
Made free by Design of our God
That of Might shall
Define what is right
For unmatched is the Power
of Chthhulhu Most High
Praising the Weapon that Cleanses our land
So perfect It's Way unopposed
These things you praise as gods
These things, dispirited things You are the One, the Oldest One
You come before the legends of men
You come before the legends of gods
You are the Sea, Creator of All You're all I need, For You I bleed
Plant Your Seed, Earth shall feed
Enlighten my soul, Spirit grows
Born of the Fire, I shall return I am the Hellspawn Curse from my eyes, your gods I defy
Fulfillment is mine, of the Most High
Born of the Fire, I shall return
Answer the Call of the Oldest One I am the Hellspawn Forever I am, in Spirit I am
Forever I Dream, Continual Dream
We Sleep undisturbed again
Chthhulhu We Dream in the Peace again I am the Hellspawn Rise, and you'll fill their souls
With all the precious of this world,
And all the glory you'll receive?
So What makes you supreme?
Rise, and your crown is falling.
I offer fantasy, and you,
create the blind, with envy. Let the children come to me
Their mother loves me, so shall they
Woman, bleeding, ate my gifts
Man was close behind
Just like a snake I'm slithering
Through my world divine
And like the cat I'm stalking
I'll take your soul and You'll
Be like me
In emptiness, free Just bow to me faithfully
Bow to me splendidly 


Something inside me
It's, it's coming out
I feel like killing you Let loose the anger, held back too long
My blood runs cold Through my anatomy, dwells another being
Rooted in my cortex, a servant to its bidding
Brutality now becomes my appetite
Violence is now a way of life The sledge my tool to torture
As it pounds down on your forehead
Eyes bulging from their sockets
With every swing of my mallet
I smash your fucking head in, until brains seep in
Through the cracks, blood does leak Distorted beauty, catastrophe
Steaming slop, splattered all over me Lifeless body, slouching dead
Lecherous abcess, where you once had a head
Avoiding the prophecy of my new found lust
You will never live again, soon your life will end I'll see you die at my feet, eternally I smash your face Facial bones collapse as I crack your skull in half
Crushing, cranial, contents
Draining the snot, I rip out the eyes
Squeezing them in my hands nerves are incised Peeling the flesh off the bottom of my weapon Involuntarily pulpifying facial regions
Suffer, and then you die
Torture, pulverized
At one with my sixth sense, I feel free
To kill as I please, no one can stop me
Created to kill, the carnage continues
Violently reshaping human facial tissue
Brutality becomes my appetite
Violence is now a way of life
The sledge my tool to torture
As it pounds down on your forehead They think they know who I am
All they know is I love to kill
Face down, dead on the ground
Find me before another is found I come alive in the darkness
Left murdered and nameless
Dead, unburied, and rotten
Half eaten by insects She was so beautiful
I HAD TO KILL HER! Tied her up
And taped her mouth shut
Couldn't scream
Raped violently
Rope tight, around her throat
Her body twitches
As she chokes Strangulation caused her death
Just like all the others
Raped before and after death
Stripped, raped, tortured They're all dead, they're all dead
They're all dead, by strangulation I come alive in the darkness
Left murdered and nameless
Dead, unburied, and rotten
Half eaten by insects It felt so good to kill I took their lives away
Seven dead, lying rotten
Unburied victims
Their naked bodies putrefy Strangulation caused her death
Just like all the others
Raped before and after death
Stripped, raped, tortured They're all dead, They're all dead
They're all dead, by strangulation I come alive in the darkness
Left murdered and nameless
Dead, unburied, and rotten
Half eaten by insects They think they know who I am
All they know is I love the kill
Face down, dead on the ground
Find me before another is found Swollen with liquid
Ready to burst
A load of my lymph
Will quench this dead bosy's thirst
One month in the grave
Twisted and half decayed
She turned a putrid yellow
I pissed in her maggot filled asshole
Fucking the rotting
My semen is bleeding
The smell of decay
Seeps from her genital cavity
The smell was unbearable
As i buried her
I cum blood
From my erection
I feel it run
Down her throat
Swallow
Eyes glassy and vacant
Body dug up to play with
Skin greasy and naked
Tonguing her rotten anus
I need a live woman
To fill with my fluid
A delicate girl
To mutilate, fuck and kill
Her body exceptional
She thought I was normal
But I wanted more
I came blood inside of her
Choking on the clot
Gagging on the snot
Gushing blood from her mouth
Bloody gel leaking out!
Body buried in a shallow grave
Unmarked for none to find
The sickness i have left behind
Undetected go my crimes
The greatest thrill of my life
To slit my own cock with a knife
Violent
Climax
Serging serum
On
My
Skin
Back from the dead
I am resurrected to spew
PUTREFACTION! Fucked with a knife

no escape from your fate
destined to be mine
every night i wait to see
in the dark, watching
stalking your every move
i know when you're all alone
all alone

tied tight to the bed
legs spread open
bruised flesh, lacerations
skin stained with blood
i'm the only one you love
i feel her heart beating
my knife deep inside
her crotch is bleeding

she liked the way it felt inside her
fucking her harder, harder

she liked the way it felt inside her
fucking her harder, harder

stick it in
rip the skin
carve and twist
torn flesh

from behind
i cut her crotch
in her ass
i stuck my cock
killing as i cum

Experimental pathogens, a devil's design
The dark side of science breeds a weapon of war
Contagious killing and internal distress
Homicide or suicide will be the cause of death Internal organs altered by the disease
Your brain disabled by the constant pain
Erratic actions lead my thoughts to the blade
I've lost control, I've lost control Beg for your life, you won't escape the knife
Your fate was sealed today
Disease has spread, you pray for death
Evisceration plague Stabbing compulsion overwhelms my mind
Terrorized screaming follows the thrust of my knife
I wrench the blade from the chest to the crotch
Organs and entrails fall to the ground Beg for your life, you won't escape the knife
Your fate was sealed today
Disease has spread, you pray for death
Evisceration plague Driven to kill, this is not my will
I am compelled to slay
Invisible foe takes control
Evisceration plague Unable to be seen but with visible effect
Virulent disease causing outbreaks of violence
They tear themselves apart, offal covers the ground
Viscera torn forcefully from the abdomen Intestines slick with blood cannot escape my grip
Surgical incisions give way to frenzied carving
Delirium has taken hold, disembowelment is complete
Horror grips my mind, my entrails are in my hands
My entrails are in my hands
My entrails are in my hands.
Plague leads to death
Plague leads to death
Plague leads to death
Plague leads to death Disease will spread and cover the world Mass insanity, the end of our time
Scavengers will eat the remains of man
Our extinction was by our design
Beg for your life, you won't escape the knife
Your fate was sealed today
Disease has spread, you pray for death
Evisceration plague
Driven to kill, this is not my will
I am compelled to slay
Invisible foe takes control
Evisceration plague Alive alone now that they've gone dead but unburied
I've seen it unfold, terrible scenes of agony
Eyes in the darkness
Echoing their madness The sights that have passed before them
Watching as though it has never happened
Now I only listen to what is not spoken Murder, hatred
Anger, Savage
Killings I have caused
more than can be counted
orgies of sadism
And sexual perversion
Virgin
Tied to my mattress
Legs spread wide
Ruptured bowel, yanked
From her insides
Devirginized with my knife
Internally bleeding
Vagina, secreting
her blood-wet pussy
I am eating
on her guts I am feeding
Mutilated with a machete
I fucked her dead body
The first and last
Your life's only romance
My knife's jammed in your ass
As you die you orgasm Pass on to the dead
Nerve trembling convulsions
No longer looking human I never see them, but I know they're there
Locked in my subconcious
Obscene memories I thought I'd forgotten
Haunting unrealities
Tear at me
Hold her arms
Her mouth taped shut
Screams unheard
Out pour her guts Layers of flesh peeling away
Languish in your own decay
descriptions of my killings
bone chilling Terror, tear, her
Virgin cunt Virgins are my victims
Their tight interiors I explore
Sharpened utensils of torture
Now inserted inside of her
Sex organs extracted for eating
On her liver I am gnawing Forbidden lust for guts
Ripped from her cunt
Tears of blood cry down her thigh I ram my fist inside her hole
From her crotch piss now flows
Rectum filled with shit
I fucked her emptied body
Until she became stiff I was once a man before I transformed
Into this molester, freshly deceased children
You have born, torn by my rape
The dead are not safe, the lifeless child corpse
I will violate Pleasure from the dead, complete satisfaction
I open the coffin
Sick thoughts run through my head as I stare
At the dead, over and over, I can't escape
I begin the dead sex, licking her young, rotted orifice
I cum in her cold cunt, shivering with ecstasy
For nine days straight I do the same
She becomes by dead, decayed child sex slave
Her neck I hack, cutting through the back
I use her mouth to eject Here I cum, blood gushes from
Bleeding black blood
Her head disconnected
As I came, viciously I cut, through her jugular vein
She's already dead, I masturbate with her severed head
My lubrication, her decomposition
Spending my life molesting dead children Intercourse with infants
Curing heads on top of spikes
Boiling skulls
Skin sliding off of bones Voices
The voices call
Voices
The voices are calling me
Buried dead I've spiritually infected
Call to me from beyond their graves Bleed
I now bleed pus
I bleed, the blood of the dead
I bleed on her livid skin
Thrusting myself within
Beginning to chop through her hairless crotch
Beyond what we know as death
It haunts me everyday
I hear the voice of every child
That lies next to me decayed
A fresh corpse, to fill with my infection
Tortured before death, no orifice left unfilled Violated after death
Virgin hole I infest
Anal pore spewing cess
The sacred juice I injest
Your dead child I defile
Necropedophile Butchery my meat hooks sharpened to penetrate
Emasculate, gouging crotches I will eat
Hung upside down, holes punctured through half chewed
Gristle, debauchery with dead bodies, turning green
Upheaveal of human entrails
Deterioration of grated genitals, dangling from the hooks
Obscene feelings deep inside me
Dislocating, separating a blood
Drenched body
Begin the anal grounting
Awaiting insertion, to rip out intestine
Bodily destruction
Vulgar molestation
Treachery never ending soul ripping
Lifeless Bodies not, petrified
Cloggins veins
Presure building
Scabbing clotted sores dehydrate
Condemned to life of obscurity
Dismal dimensions of my being, I explore my thoughts through murder
Devoting my life to mutilation
Screams of blood saturate, grubs feed on dilapidated
Stumps, darkness overshadowing the killing
Eyes now dialate
Bodies disintegrate
Razor sharp hooks implanted in your rectum
Splitting bodies, spilling guts on the ground
Sodomizing living beings with my utensils
Stabbing on your life stripped of all your skin
Disgusting to the world
Beauty to my eyes
The body lying naked, discharging my infection
Invigorating while I kill, intoxicating
Invoking suffering on human beings
Grinding orifices my only therapy
Sculpting gore
Muscle tissue
Reshaping
Mounds of flesh, deformation
Skulls of victims stacked like trophies
Bleeding from your arse sudden blood ejection Torn from your body, removed while you scream
Dissect to collect, my blade now reaps
Pieces of flesh lie side by side
Worn on my body or put on display You mark your skin, it gives you pleasure
I take your precious art, it becomes my leather
Taking your hide before you have died
Decency defied Crudely I cut away
All are my prey
Tell me how it feels
When your flesh is peeled
You are vain with your art
I desire it torn apart
With my insane hunting the removal of flesh now starts You mark your skin, it gives you pleasure
I take your precious art, it becomes my leather
Taking your hide before you have died
Decency defied To you a design
Now a trophy made mine
To you a design
Now a trophy made mine I seek to find
To satisfy my fucked mind
I seek to find
To satisfy my fucked mind 
Ignoring your cries
Exposing your insides
Violence defined Torn from your body, removed while you scream
Dissect to collect my blade now reaps
Pieces of flesh lie side by side
Worn on my body or put on display
You mark your skin, it gives you pleasure
I take your precious art, it becomes my leather
Taking your hide before you have died
Decency defied Enter the graveyard,
Searching for a female corpse
Dead for thirteen years
The perfect whore to fill my need
Dig her body up
Crack open gruesome tomb
Ceremonial
Covert necrophilia
Why must I masturbate at the sight of maggots
That are crawling on her face?
Drawn to the coffin's stench that holds an impure
Wench, inhumanity
Half skeletal remains
Insatiable desire to inseminate
Swarm a parasitic plague enables me to emulate
A state of constant disarray
Worm infested, worm infested, worm infested
Worm infested, worm infested, worm infested
Chew the bitches fuckin head
Eat her fetid skin and relish in the violation
Tear tissue from the bone as these actions go
Unkown; vicious cruelty
Vile distal cruelty
Snapping bones in two, defiling cavities continues
Fierce repulsive fanasies enables me to emulate
A state of constant disarray
Worm infested, worm infested, worm infested
I must fuck her worm infested, worm infested
Cunt
Excoriate, disseminate, demoralize, to sodomize
Excoriate, disseminate, demoralize, to sodomize
Despicable degradation, excoriate her
Inimical depredation, disseminate her
Ignominious domination, demoralize her
Presumptuous defecation to sodomize her
Why must I masturbate at the sight of maggots

Worm infested, worm infested, worm infested

Cunt
Worm infested cunt Birth is always painful, Decaying in the womb trapped withtin this body
A bleeding human tomb gutted bitch lies dead emptied of the child
Chewing on the cords its life line to this world afterbirth is flowing
The stench is overwhelming
My body, growing stronger, my pain turns to torture
Severing its bloodline
A butchered infant carcass
Meat from the unborn, the freshest kills
Chopped up children bathing in blood
Contoured and festering I rot in disgust
Re-generation of my body
Mother ripped apart
Smashing in her face
My knife cutting holes, fucking her remains
Esophogus carved out
Crushing cartilage
Bile oozing from punctures in your liver
Riping meat from within
Chewing in instestine
Bladder spurting urine, sight of defecation now grow infection
The child ripped to shreds
Drinking its excertions
Zombification ejaculation over mutilation
On the mothers body hacked into peices
The sludges from my cock gives her life once again
Sewing the remains of the child deep within her
Reborn through evil
My toture known throughout hell
Heed is his calling, the demons await my next kill
Carnage is my fetish
Body cavities scraped of guts
Brains seeping from cracks as my axe continues to hack Take me back
Back to the scene
It's coming back
I remember her screams
The fear in her eye
The night she died
It left me empty
Hollow inside Dead to the world, I see only black, there's blood on my hands
Dead to the world, I see only black, the blood of the dead Feelings deep inside
I don't understand
Can't fall asleep at night
I try and wake in fright
Touch of her skin
Next to mine
Warm and wet
Deep inside Dead to the world, I see only black, there's blood on my hands
Dead to the world, I see only black, the blood of the dead I wrapped my hands around her neck
Squeezing out her breath
Eyes rolled back in her head
Clawing at my skin
I know now it's not my fault
She was asking for it Memories
Came back to me
In the night
I hear her screams
Waiting
In the grave
Calling out Come to me
I hear her screaming
Waiting, in the grave
Calling out, but she's buried
Waiting, in the grave
Come to me
I hear her screaming
Waiting I wrapped my hands around her neck
Squeezing out her breath
Eyes rolled back in her head
Clawing at my skin
I know now it's not my fault
She was asking for it Memories
Came back to me
In the night
I hear her screams
Waiting
In the grave
Calling out I remember her screams
The night she died
I left her empty
Hollow inside Dead to the world, I see only black, there's blood on my hands
Dead to the world, I see only black, the blood of the dead inborn, lack of conscience
I think but cannot feel
Affectations
Manipulations
Victims bend to my will Passed through generations
Murderous ways
Proclivity for violence
No remorse or shame Murder, a fascination
Dispatching those who trust
My compulsion
Fleeting fulfillment
No joy will ever last The soulless walk among you
Concealed by deceit
Smiling when I face you
Slashing when your turn This vector of cruelty
Denied me a soul
Genetic mutation
Driving me Your pleas cannot move me
No mercy to give
I seek domination
A master of pain This vector of cruelty
Emotionless, cold
No human connection
Weakening Cold-blooded and willful
I slaughtered them all
They thought I'd protect them
But I made them die Legacy, abnormality
The ladder twists, and the rungs are broken
Impregnate, and the vector spreads Momentum shifts, and I start controlling
Parasite, of morality
Malevolent, eyes are empty
Merciless, I cannot care This vector of cruelty
Denied me a soul
Genetic mutation
Driving me Your pleas cannot move me
No mercy to give
I seek domination
A master of pain This vector of cruelty
Emotionless, cold
No human connection
Weakening Cold-blooded and willful
I slaughtered them all
They thought I'd protect them
But I made them die Sever the limbs
Decapitate
Yank out the teeth
Then masturbate
Pounding the face
Ejaculate
My darkest needs
I satiate
Bathe in blood
Wallow in bile
Tear out the heart
Victim defiled Sever the limbs
Decapitate
Yank out the teeth
Then masturbate
Pounding the face
Ejaculate Entrails slip through my fingers
As I sift through her innards
My body rigid with goose bumps
My erection growing stronger
I put my cock into the carcass
My climax can wait no longer
Expectorate my seed of hate
Onto her mutilated corpse Sever the limbs
Decapitate
Yank out the teeth
Then masturbate
Pounding the face
Ejaculate
My darkest needs
I satiate Bathe in blood
Wallow in bile
Tear out the heart
Victim defiled I Don't Know I just took that knife
And I cut her from her neck
Down to anus
And I cut out the vagina
And I eat it A relapse of my body
Sends my mind into multiple seizures
Psychologically a new human being
One that has never been Cursed by the shaman his voodoo spell has my soul
My limbs go numb
I can't control my own thought
Are his now
his evil consuming me
ever telling me
begin the clit carving Slowly turning me, into a flesh eating zombie
Knowing this spell can only be broken
by the vaginal skins of young women
I proceed to find the meat
their bleeding cunts will set me free
Warmth seeping from this
Body
Rotted
After I sucked the blood from her ass I feel more alive
more alive than I've ever been
Even though now I'm dead within My mouth drools
As I slice your perinium
My body smeared
With the guts I've extracted
through her hole, came swollen organs
cunnilingus with the mutilated My spirit returned from the dead
Released by the priest
but I felt more real
when I was dead The curse is broken
I have a dependence on vaginal skin
It's become my sexual addiction
I must slit, the twitching clit
Rotted cavity hold the juice
Between the legs, I love to carve
My cock is dripping with her blood The blade goes in you and it enters smooth
Disturbing moans begin to soothe
Scraping bone with steel to feel it once
Keep pushing hard it never stops Had to do it
Had to put it in your gut
Nothing to it
Grab the handle let it slice Heart polluted
As it's cut out of your chest
Gushing fluids
Bleeding it dry As deep as the knife will go
A life changing transfer of power
As deep as the knife will go As deep as the knife will go
Every inch of it in you savored
As deep as the knife will go The blade has always done its job well
Seems like its work is never done
Scraping bone with steel to feel it twice
Keep pushing hard it doesn't stop Desecrated
A body rid of living
Future faded
Gaping hole from front to back Heart dissected
As it sits upon your chest
Gushing fluids
Drain you empty As deep as the knife will go
A life changing transfer of power
As deep as the knife will go As deep as the knife will go
Every inch of it in you savored
As deep as the knife will go Bleed it dry
Bleed it dry
Drain you empty
Drain you empty As deep as the knife will go
A life changing transfer of power
As deep as the knife will go As deep as the knife will go
Every inch of it in you savored
As deep as the knife will go Viral contagion unleashed upon the erath
Billons of infected dead soon rise
Stalking th living to feast upon the flesh
Its fight or flee to survive Living out the days and nights in absolite fear
Never knowing when and where the
threat of the undead draws near
Thoughts of those left behind
Are slowly tormenting you mind Killing is essential to survive
The world you once knew forever changed
Scavening just to stay alive
Time to release your inner rage Fire up the chainsaw
Hack all their heads off
Fire up the chainsaw
Hack their fucking heads off If you want to live you have to kill or become
There's no other way you have to kill or become
If you wan to live you have to kill or become
There's no other way you have to kill or become Fire up the chainsaw
Hack all their heads off
Fire up the chainsaw
Hack their fucking heads off Viral contagion unleashed upon the erath
Billons of infected dead soon rise Stalking th living to feast upon the flesh
Its fight or flee to survive
Fire up the chainsaw
Hack all their heads off
Fire up the chainsaw
Hack their fucking heads off
If you want to live you have to kill or become
There's no other way you have to kill or become
If you wan to live you have to kill or become
There's no other way you have to kill or become Intestines exposed
By violent thrusts
The innards removes
Dissecting the guts
To rip through the skin
Tissue and muscle
Cartilage shredding
Draining blood vessels Frenzied hacking
Morals lacking
Eviscerate
Life is gone before my eyes Flesh matters the most
When splattered around
Its never morose
Absurdly profouned
Fresh insides come out
Excitedly done
My purpose in life
To kill just for fun Frenzied hacking
Morals lacking
Eviscerate
Life is gone before my eyes Frantic disembowelment
Deprived of vital content
Organ loss without consent
Spastic slicing an event
Sharpend steel my covenant
Frantic disembowelment
Mutilating miscreant
Sickening accomplishment
Spreading gore is ime worth spent
Perpetuate this mad intent
Eternally malevolent
Frantic disembowelment Kidneys exposed
The pancreas flew
Stomach deleted
The spleen I did chew
The carving is over
You lost and I won
Fulfilling my dream
I killed you for fun Frenzied hacking
Morals lacking
Eviscerate
Life is gone before my eyes Frantic disembowelment lyrics, vocal patterns: Mazurkiewicz As the blood begins to gush out the side of your neck
I thrust my cold steel into your face, your closer to death
A twelwe inch blade will help decide your ultimate fate
This summons to die has been given to you for accepting my hate Stabbed in the throat
For no reason but to kill, for no reason but the thrill
You must die for me to survive
Stabbed in the throat
I believe in sacrifice, sliced open with my knife
Your body is now life deprived Vocal cords twitching, esophagus severed, a hemorrhaging brain
Your lacerated jugular vein is spurting away
As mortality fades I am ready to flay your whole body and head
Vigorously carving this fresh human flesh, I am one with the dead Stabbed in the throat
For no reason but to kill, for no reason but the thrill
You must die for me to survive
Stabbed in the throat
I believe in sacrifice, sliced open with my knife
Your body is now life deprived I'm chewing bloody skin from the cadaver
Consuming lifeless meat, mangled and tattered
Half-eaten corpse lies skinless in the gutter
I am revitalized Odium, embedded in my skull To kill and eat your prey a way of nature
The taste of death must consciously be savored
My cannibal existence never dangered
Just look into my eyes Subjugate, intensity to blame Gnawing on the head, sliced to fucking shreds
Knife to the gullet results in cessation 
Stabbed in the throat
For no reason but to kill, for no reason but the thrill
You must die for me to survive
Stabbed in the throat
I believe in sacrifice, sliced open with my knife
Your body is now life deprived The basement incinerator
Is where they'll put the head
Hose the floor and clean the room
Anywhere they bled Into boxes go the bags
Fill the space with rocks
In the dark of night
He throws them off the docks Rotting in the river
Never to be found
Under tons of concrete
Deep beneath the ground From behind he grabs his mouth
The blade goes to his neck
Bulging veins pumping blood
He struggles to protect If you don't cut open the stomach
The corpse will rise and float
The victim is discovered dead
Rotting organs bloat The killer chops the body
With a scalpel and an ax
The parts are then drained
And put into the sacks Grab the neck, Slit the throat, take the life
Hang the corpse, Prepare to drain the blood Bone saw, meat cleaver, filleting knife
Carve the corpse, Dissect him in the tub Smash the teeth, slice off scars, crush the bones
With a crowbar, scrape off all tattoos If you don't cut open the stomach
The corpse will rise and float
The victim is discovered dead
Rotting organs bloat The killer chops the body
With a scalpel and an ax
The parts are then drained
And put into the sacks Chunks of a skull
Sawn in half bones
Body is found
Killer unknown Melting thoughts of disintegration
Hitting deep her insistence
to mutilate her newborn infants
After giving birth her mind wasn't the same
Slowly slipping away, a state of mental decay
Family now complete
Father watches on
As mother dismembers her newborn son
Dissecting the specimen, split I will explore, the
body wide open
Uncover carnage within, split wide open
Virgin, untouched skin
Releasing her rage
That dwells inside
tainted blood rushes through veins
her body chemically changed
Love was erased, on the edge of a butcher's knife
The kitchen becomes a makeshift slaughterhouse
every nine months she butchers one more child
Reminders of the deceased, scattered through the home
Bones and skulls of sons and daughters
Genitals ferment
In jars inside the cupboards
for father to dissect
No one will discover the murder they commit
Children used like laboratory rats
Sickening vulgar experiments
She sees what others can't
Probing the guts of her fetus
Advocation of the pain
Mutilating, draining veins
Witness the horror
offering to themselves
Continuing murdering their own kind
Never deny this fantasy life, they enjoy
Addiction to this heightened state
Post-birth psychosis
disjointing her own children
form the life they'll never live
A massacre within her soul
Struggling for control Trapped beneath rotting remains
A slow decay of life takes its form Withered death and bone emerge
From cemeteries of the earth
Replacing all that is known from this world Towering structures take shape
As more cities are laid to waste Survivors of this morbid fate
The reborn meek not live not dead
Are left to start a new
Misshapen half mutated
Not a zombie not a human
Evil creatures grew Not one thing left alive but them
The strongest will begin to reign A new society takes place
Where the way of the Cannibal
Rules in this skeletal domain A kingdom of the damned Carnal war consuming them by
Eating flesh for nourishment
Solution for a short-term survival Slaughtered are the weakest first
Feeding those with evil thirst
As blood of the dead saturates the ground Again the end has begun
Another kingdom will be damned Survivors of this morbid fate
The reborn meek not live not dead
Are left to start a new Misshapen and half mutated
Not a zombie not a human
Evil creatures grew Not one thing left alive but them
The strongest will begin to reign A new society takes place
Where the way of the cannibal
Rules in this skeletal domain Survivors of this morbid fate
The reborn meek not live not dead
Are left to start a new Misshapen and half mutated
Not a zombie not a human
Evil creatures grew Not one thing left alive but them
The strongest will begin to reign A new society takes place
Where the way of the Cannibal
Rules in this skeletal domain Crimes of passion
Ruled his mind
The anger inside
Compassion he will never find The pain and pleasure
Of the blade
And he loved
The screams she made Forgive me father
For I have sinned
Because the anger
Burned within Unfaithful
He saw it in her eyes
They wouldn't hide
Betrayal and her wicked lies Confessions
From a dying man
Listen now
And understand Shadows
In the night
Pain
That summons fright He looked
Into her eyes
And tells her
Tonight she dies But to you
I must confess
That when she died
She was the best My deep aversions
Building for years
Smoldering contempt internally burns
Dark introspection
Memories of scorn
Every slight an element of my simmering mind Conflicted modules
Dictate my course
Feed me violence and my hatred will gorge
Resolve is growing
It must be done
And to this fury I'll be forced to succumb Rage
This notion of murder is no longer vague
Seethe
Your life I abominate
Rage
Boiling deep within my head
Seethe
My mind is a cauldron of hate Concealed revulsion
Benign facade
Roiling dreams of murder coursing through my skull
Savage visions
Nearing the brim
How can contain this murderous rage The mental picture
Becoming clear
Execration too extreme to bear
An execution
My plan of action
Advent of the day of blood no longer imagination Scream
The horrors of vengeance unleashed on you now
Bleed
Your body will suffer my pain
Scream
Your body will writhe as my mind long has
Bleed
My mind is a cauldron of hate Terrorize
Realizatiom that your final day has come
Your demise
Torturing you to death brings satisfaction to my livid brain Die I carve your flesh
Tear off your face
Retribution
This death your fate Rage
This notion of murder is no longer vague
Seethe
Your life I abominate
Rage
Boiling deep within my head

Butchering victims and watching them bleed

Undying lust for cadaverous molestation
sights of death building my sensations
Ferocious need for decomposing bodies Sex with the dead now I must breed
Within the stiff corpse planting my seed
The taste of formaldahyde, smell of the rot
Suck out the goo, feast on her crotch Raging fires of hell, burning through my soul
My love for a dead fuck, what I cannot control
The child soon will rise, all evil will survive
Birth through death The newborn needs a feast, its mother is the meal
Chomping on her flesh, his teeth tearing her skin I love to fuck the dead, demons in my head
Tearing at my brain I love to fuck the dead, demons in my head
Tearing at my brain Bleeding sores beginning to stench
While you lick the festering stump
Green infection discharging puss
Devour the putrid afterbirth Sex with the dead now I must breed
Within the stiff corpse planting my seed
The taste of formaldahyde, smell of the rot
Suck out the goo, feast on her crotch In thrall to the evil lord
A procession of the damned
Sweating blood to serve the beast
Desolation of their souls They slave in fire
Whips of Hades at their backs
The Scourge of Iron
Hell's eternal pact Lash them
Rip their skin
Scourge of Iron
Rending flesh On earth they lived by force
Now the villains march in chains
Men of violence doomed in death
Their reward for a life of sin They slave for eons
There will be no relief
Mere pawns of evil
Used and then enslaved Lash them

Iron whip will be relentless
And the pain will never end Lash them

Still I see
Dead on the table
Try to move, I'm not able to They said I have died
I still feel alive
I won't believe their lies
I can still see through these
Eyes Help me I'm not dead
Wake me from this hell
Tell me I'm alive
Dead Knives cutting into me
Scalpels rip me
Screaming into deaf ears
Now they stop and see my tears Help me I'm not dead
Wake me from this hell
Tell me I'm alive
Dead I can't stop the visions
Stop the premonitions Help me I'm not dead
Wake me from this hell
Tell me I'm alive
Dead My soul can't escape
The boundary of my flesh
My heart does not beat
My spirit will not rest They said I have died
I still feel alive
I won't believe their lies
I can still see through these
Eyes Fingers missing from hands, ready to snap bones
And necks, pierced together from dead tissue
Body parts crudely sewn,
face is smashed to pulp drooling from an empty socket
Brain half
Dead
Hungry for flesh
Many souls commanding my existence
My body alive, I defy, the life I've been given
I should have remained dead
Experimenting on dead tissue, convulsing bodies on the table
Reanimation of the dead, rusty scapals cutting skin
Pieced together parts and parts
Transplanting human life
Rotten organs, restal pus
Spitting up your galbladder
Donation of bodily organs carved from broken bodies
Eyes melting, skin exploding
Every bloody bleeding
Meat inter-changed from the mutalated stiffs
Parts of the dead are never to rest
Lymphatic nodes
Implode, while the brain corrodes
Bodies sold to science, profiting from the dead
Creation of a being never known to man
Heart pumping pus through the body, sliced in sections, the putrid infection
Regaining life from beyond To rip the flesh from your bones
Stripped of flesh, unsighty
Torn in two, slicing through you
Live organs needed to be reanimated Pathologist sawing the skull of the donor, now he lies
Dead
Awaiting a new brain
Re-cycling the bodies, parts of the dead
Exposing their insides, slitting their necks
Finding a way
Bringing life to the corpse, one dead on my table
Soon to walk again
Fingers missing from hands
Ready to snap bones and necks
Pieced together from
Dead tissue
Face is smashed to pulp, drooling from
An empty socket
Brain half-dead, hungry for flesh
Many souls commanding my existence, my body alive,
I derfy, the life I've been given
I should have remain dead Bleeding Slicing through the flesh
A knife stuck in your neck
Stabbing out your eyes
Cutting through the spine Blood burning through my veins
We have risen from the grave Live, life Dead for years, now alive
The dead came to life Dead creatures out for blood
After death we will awaken
Unhuman beings from beyond
Rotting zombies out for blood Bleed, bleed Bleeding through my pores
Clotted pus, crusts my skin
My body cold
But I live on
Bleeding The dead awaken, living rotten
Rotten living dead Slicing through the flesh
A knife stuck in your neck
Stabbing out your eyes
Cutting through the spine Blood burning through my veins
We have risen from the grave Live, life, dead The outlander walked into town, coverd in gore
He knew he could not wait much longer, he needed more
Death
Pain
Terror
Blood. On the high plain they lost their lives
Hundreds were slain
Why they died no one will know
Their bloodstains weill allways show for all time Wasting no time he began defiling whores
He would be the last man they felt, a carnivore
Tear
Rape
Ravage
Maim On the high plain they lost their lives
Hundreds were slain
Why they died no one knows
Their bloodstains will always show for all time Firing, loaded rifle, never ending killing spree
Slashing with machette, body parts are the debris
There is no escape, he holds your fate as the death rate climbs to the
fullest extent
One more town, slowly going down
This is the comming of endless torment 
Unburied victims lie, blood soaking into the sand
Remains of the slain, a dead body wasteland
There is no escape, he holds your fate as the death rate climbs to the
fullest extent
One man left, sherif bereft, faces the stranger with intent 
On the high plain they lost their lives
Hundreds were slain
Why they died no one will know
Their bloodstains will always sho for all.
Time
Expired
Big iron
Both die On the high plain they lost their lives
Hundreds were slain
Why they died no one will know
Their bloodstains will always sho for all.

A dreadful horrid feeling sets in
Scrambling for weapons, an attempt to defend
Against a gruesome horde of undead Shower them with fire, make them burn in the flames
Somehow they continue to march
Ravenous savages they'll tear you apart
They'll eat your fuckin guts and your brains How do you kill what is not alive?
Break them down to stop their descent
Smash the bastards into the ground
And when they're down, shatter their bones. Shower them with fire, make them burn in the flames

Heights unimagined unattained
To drop bodies from the sky
Falling
Alive in mid air moving fast
Heads exploding on the ground
Throwing
Corrupted souls in front of trains
Just to watch the bodies fly
Grinning
At the site of shredded innards
Brains exploded all around High velocity impact spatter Slamming
You into walls exessive speed
Creates catastrophic sounds
Scraping
Flesh blood and guts from off the pavement

Piercing

Something I will always need High velocity impact spatter A necro potion is made
From the remains of the dead Daily ritual intake
Drinking remains of the dead Death after life after death
Only obtained in one way High velocity impact spatter Dangling above a vat of putrid muck
A rancid stench of foul decay never encountered before
Screaming in horror for I now remember my fate
I will be Submerged In Boiling Flesh
This cauldron will soon take my life Upside down my mind is warping
Cannot break free
From teh shackles
Bloodied chains cut circulation
Losing reason
Gag and vomit Blisters are forming all over my body now
Oozing with pus as they start to explode, fervent finality
The fumes and the vapors have perforated my lungs
Writhing and twitching from maddening pin
Why must i die like this? Insanity not far away
Mental breakdown
Scathing havoc
Pray for death to come and get me
Inner anguish
Begins Fear
Recieved
Relentless
Malignancy Near the end is what I'm sensing
Must acccept it
Can't accept it
Last attempts to stop this nightmare
Cannot be done
I will be dead Gone
Berzerk
While waiting
My life will boil To struggle is useless 
Plunge
Fatal
Paradise
Of the obscene 
Enter the tank
It doesn't take long
Epidermis dissolved
All that's left are my bones
It's a matter of seconds when defleshed in flesh
My body now part of sick mire
This chamber of liguefied humans that I have amassed is completed because i was last in line Repulsion of beauty drove me to hunt
A frenzy of self hate possessing me
Violated their bodies, stripped of their pride
Tortured and twisted until they have died
Hatred inside is all I would find
I despise what I see in the mirror
Sadistic hateful scum
I kill them but it's myself I hate
Now I'll do myself too
A straight razor will reshape my face
First my ears then my nose
Blood is gushing continue to carve
Erase the face I hate
Now I'm hacking at my chest
A frenzy of self hate possessing me
Controls my actions, controls my thoughts
As I scrape away my skin
I fill my tub, with alcohol
I plunge in to the burning pool
The pain intense, my whole body is drenched in scalding liquid
Despite my pain I am able
To grab a lighter on the counter
The flint ignites, the flames erupt
I'm consumed in the inferno
Cauterize, my skin is charred
Regenerate, more loathsome than before
I despise what I see in the mirror
Sadistic hateful scum
The abomination before my eyes
A reflection of me
I see an image of disfigured evil
I've skinned myself alive
Dripping with blood and blistered by fire
The face I hate erased Like a virus of the mind
My rage will spread
My obsession with murder
Roils in my head Killing victims with my hands
I cannot control
These extreme compulsions
Burn in my soul Foaming at the mouth I leap
Onto my prey
Target of my violence
Will die today Feel the victim's cracking bones
He screams in pain
Only slaughter brings me peace
I have gone insane Rabid Inflammation of the brain
Fury overwhelms
There is something wrong with me
I am not well Victim's head
Thumbs in his eyes
Blood is squirting from the sockets
Pours down the sides Smash his teeth with my fist
Tear off his nose
Laughing at his shattered face
Rage only grows
With my fingers gouge his throat
Rip slabs of flesh
I continue the assault
But he is clearly dead Rabid Can't restrain my need to kill them drives me mad
I'm insane I want to spill blood with my hands Schizophrenic mania
Paranoid anxiety
Violent ferocity
Criminal insanity I am obsessed with butchery I am mad
A trail of corpses so much blood on my hands Rabid
Rabid Stab the knife into the face and then wrench the blade inside
Murder this piece of shit
Scraps of flesh and severed bone are on the floor, these I must hide Pounding the teeth
Comminute bones
They never will know Chop up the corpse
Concealing my crime
They never will find
Evidence in the furnace Secret cremation
You fucked with me and now any trace of you is completely gone Charring the flesh
The body is ash
They never will know Burning the corpse
Consumed by the flames
They never will find
Evidence in the furnace You cease to exist
Investigations fail to find a single useful clue
Their search is futile Proof is destroyed in the searing heat, you melt away
No body, no case
There is no trace Smoldering coals that once were your bones turn to ash
Your life is erased
There is no trace You cease to exist but the search will go on, they cannot find
Their closure denied
Dead or alive You're not the first and you won't be the last
To burn in my fires
Corpses will burn
Burn in my fires
Your corpse will burn Burn in my fires
Corpses will burn
Burn in my fires
Your corpse will burn Charring the flesh
The body is ash
They never will know Burning the corpse
Consumed by the flames
They never will find
Evidence in the furnace Descend upon the village on a mission of death
Setting fire to their homes, attacking the men
We hear their women screaming as we hack off their heads
We show no fucking mercy to them, they will be annihilated Targeting their necks, a ruthless slaughter begins
Our axes swing with malice, blood drips from the blades
Utterly defeated, their forces put to rout

Our conquest is complete Take their leader captive, march him to the square
His weaknesses exploited now we take his life

The skull hits the ground
Writhing and twitching from brains being splattered I'll never get used to that sound
Gaze at the fear in eyes horrified terrified just as a life will expire
Blood drips away from an utter disgrace in hell I will kill you again Torn through with vengeance o blame
Torn through for wanting you dead Anger summoned evil deep inside my rotting soul
Remnants of a morbid past implies my mind is out of control
Putrid vision seen before but only seen by me
Screaming voices whisper murder
Pent up wrath is fed with killing sprees Prolonged brutal rampage slaughter with no end in sight
Remnants of a morbid past implies my mind is out of control Unforgiving pain is what another death sets free
Sacrifice of sanity accelerates my lack of control Putrid vision seen before but only seen by me

Repeat the process again
Cranial penetration Ice-pick lobotomy Trapped in this prison awaiting my death
Condemned to die by draconian means
An eye for an eye is the rule of this land
But the victim in question did not die by my Hand
A mockery of justice
Inequity
The murderer will live but I will die Strapped to a chair unable to breathe
Other condemned have died before me
Constrained in the chair I saw fear in their eyes
The executioner smiled as he took their Lives
Crushing their windpipes
Garroted
Throttled with iron they succumb to death The Strangulation Chair
Constriction of the throat
No air for the lungs, no blood for the brain A death I don't deserve
Blameless of this crime
Only I know this is true The Strangulation Chair
The spinal column breaks
Then my life will cease, my final release A death I have not earned
But still have to face
They are the murderers now My day has come now it's my turn to die
Hands tied they lead me away
The executioner collars my neck
In terror I wait for my strangulation
My strangulation, my strangulation Death
My mind slips to darkness
Unconscious forever
The crime they committed they will not know The Strangulation Chair
Constriction of the throat
No air for the lungs, no blood for the brain A death I don't deserve
Blameless of this crime
Only I know this is true The Strangulation Chair
The spinal column breaks
Then my life will cease, my final release A death I have not earned
But still have to face
They are the murderers now Sharpen the pick
To pierce the skull through the ear
Stab at an angle
Cranial transfixion, hearing and vision terminated by the penetration Skewered from ear to eye
Lancing the boil of your mind
Deafened by the piercing thrust
Exit wound has left you blind Skewered from ear to eye
Bisection of the brain by steel
Final thoughts will dissipate
Unable to perceive what is real Struggle with death
In shock you grasp at the air
Senses deprived
Cerebral cessation, mental division created by this perforation Skewered from ear to eye
Lancing the boil of your mind
Deafened by the piercing thrust
Exit wound has left you blind Skewered from ear to eye
Bisection of the brain by steel
Final thoughts will dissipate
Unable to perceive what is real Boring through the brain, eye impaled upon the point
Steel spears crisscross your grey matter
Puncturing the eardrum and the blood begins to ooze
Red blooms grace the dying head Auditory nerve is severed
Labyrinth destroyed
You are rendered deaf and blind
Seconds before death On a spit
Your head will burn
Charring flesh
Brain tissue congeals Crack the skull
Open wide
Scoop it out
I consume your mind Eating the brain
To gain the knowledge of death
You are inside
Psychic absorption, hearing and vision
Are now mine through this appropriation Skewered from ear to eye
Lancing the boil of your mind
Deafened by the piercing thrust
Exit wound has left you blind Skewered from ear to eye
Bisection of the brain by steel
Final thoughts will dissipate
Unable to perceive what is real Stalking his prey
He prepares for the ambush
I hear his steps
But without trepidation
Hyper aware
I will strike back When he brandished the blade
Gave his intentions away Back to the wall, I have no choice
It's time to fight or die
I will respond with overwhelming force
A switch turns on and I must survive Fearless resolve
As I spring into action Quickly disarm
And remove his advantage
Only one thing on my mind
Stop his attack Now he's on the defense
Momentum is shifting my way A savage brawl, I hear his voice
Pure terror in his cries
Break his balance, slam him to the ground
Following through to stay alive Landing multiple bowls
The blood is starting to spray Will not stop till I am sure
The threat has been put down
Raining with forearm thrusts
Torrents of blood flow from his eyes
Bloodstained cement No weakness to exploit
His ambush failed
Hammer fists break facial bones
Knuckles bleed from shards of teeth Smash his skull onto pavement
Make the bastard pay
Don't stop until it cracks
And spills out his brain Bloodstained cement When he chose me as prey
A fatal mistake was made Cadaver filled carcasses flood the land
Methodically emptied of bone and blood
Left to be one with the dirt again
To decompose
It will all end in the dirt again He starts with the draining of liquid mass
His victims lie helpless and wide awake
Bodies are shriveled to skeletal form
To decompose
Victims die helpless while siphoned awake Sacrificing mortal beings never to subside
Savage beatings pulverized and no one heard the cries
Taking all the innards out of every single corpse
Decomposing slaughtered waits to rot Cadaver filled carcasses flood the land
Methodically emptied of bone and blood
Left to be one with the dirt again
To decompose
It will all end in the dirt again Bone matter is now removed from the skin
Collection of remurs used to impale
Scattered skulls with oozing brains left unfound
To decompose
Splitting the spines like he's done it before Sacrificing mortal beings never to subside
Savage beatings pulverized and no one heard the cries
Taking all the innards out of every single corpse
Decomposing slaughtered wait to rot Morbid fascination with the dead
Bones blood brutally dissolved
Constant threat of killing all he sees
Revenge always gets involved Morbid inclination warps his mind
Terror saturates his eyes
Foreseen decimation feeds his mind
Starving for the next attack Cadaver filled carcasses flood the land
Methodically emptied of bone and blood
Left to beone with the dirt again
To decompose
It will all end in the dirt again Left to be one with the dirt again
It all will end in the dirt again
Left to be one with the dirt again
To decompose
It all will end in the dirt again Sacrificing mortal beings never to subside
Savage beatings pulverized and no one heard the cries
Taking all the innards out of every single corpse
Decomposing slaughtered waits to rot Creeping in the shadows
Shadows of the night
Wading through the darkness
A death before the light
Blending in with faces
Faces of the night
Safe at home in comfort
At home is where you'll die Watching you
Knowing your every move
Hearing you
Every single word that you spew
Carving you
Is what I'm about to do
Saving you
From the torment of this earth to be buried for rebirth Silently I enter through the broken basement window now to wait
It's twelve o clock the time has come ascend the staircase to the hunted one
Make way to the second floor right outside your open bedroom door
One last time to sleep in peace unaware of brutal things that Will be done
To you after you awake
Enter slow
Machete leads the way
Eerie calm
Death is in the air
Savage thrust
Death is everywhere Adrenaline is pumping as my heart is pounding faster yours slows down
Choke on blood and breathe your last breath mangled
Guts I wear to celebrate
Stay inside and fuck the corpse an innards orgy satisfies my needs
Finally I feel complete by eating brains and flesh Followed home then killed
Sacrificed in vain
Followed home then killed
I stalked you for years
Followed home then killed Take what's left in garbage bags and throw them in a hole I dug out back
Clean the room I killed you in making sure the clues of sin are gone
Revel in my vicious deed and replay what had happened in my head
Vivid memories of you remain of your remains Followed home then killed
Sacrificed in vain
Followed home then killed
I stalked you for years
Followed home then killed Followed home then killed Always the same
Killing for years
You have died and
I brought you back
While you see the dark

Thickened liquid soaks my feet it's rising upward
Shrieks of panic
Hardened liquid traps my feet insanity is closer I don't want to die
No one hears my cries
Liquid to my knees
Encased in concrete
Come to realize
My life won't last long
Hardened to my knees
Encased in concrete Can't break free immobilized
Thinning air asphyxiates
Won't cling on to life much longer
Almost over Almost covered
Thickened liquid to my chest it's rising upward
Silent panic
Hardened liquid to my chest insanity is here Gag
A tube is forced down my throat to breathe
Air
Convulsions from the oxygen intake
Lungs
Are barely expanding slow suffocation
Choke
Ice cold cement is poured over my head Massive pressure as it sets
Never to be seen again
Won't cling on to life much longer
Almost over Wanted to survive
No one heard my cries
Liquid transforming
Encased in concrete
Come to realize My life won't last long
Shrouding my body
Encased in concrete Encased in concrete Putrid mess lays in the woods
Removed of organs and meat
13 mounds of bony flesh
Hollowed out expect for maggots
That dwell
Deep inside the skulls
Of victims that they cleaned
How did this horror unfold No trace of evidence was left behind
At this scene of gore
Will the truth ever be told Only time will tell Will there be more to find
Some more hollowed bodies

Will the truth ever be told Only if I tell Will there be more to find
Some more hollowed bodies

With their untold stories Cadavers rot
Cadavers rot hollowed Bodies were found
Hollowed bodies

Hollowed bodies Butchers drag me to the rack
Bind my hands to the bar
Legs are fastened to the table
Hooded man unsheathes his knife Incisions will be made
Blood drips from the blade
Visceral display Hook attached inside
Cavity gaping wide
Soon I will die Intestinal crank Merciless, they turn the crank
Interrogation has begun
Awake I'm being disemboweled

I don't think you'll live Crucifixion, peasants bound to the cross
Heartless judgement, tyrannical laws
Among the jurists pangs of conscience arise
Conspiracy begins, the crucifier must fall Assassination was attempted but failed
The conspirators are captured and jailed
Enraged by the plot now he vows his revenge
Hunt them down, seek their death, merciless Collaborators face a summary trial
They are guilty there can be no denial
Convicted plotters face the hammer and nail
The traitors will be punished, the traitors will die Their compunction, a sentence of death
Thoughts of mercy are replaced by dread
Punishment for traitors, swift and severe
Kill them all, they will die, crucify Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill
Vengeance, the betrayers bound and hung by nails
Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill
Revenge, their betrayal only brought them hell Punctured by piercing, the beam dripping blood
As a deterrent they are left there for months
Their agonizing deaths will serve to warn the rest
Betrayers will be hunted, betrayers will die Wretched traitors, sun cooking their flesh
Rotting slowly they're begging for death
Transfixed by iron only bones will remain
He will hunt, hell's pursuit, execute Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill
Vengeance, the betrayers bound and hung by nails
Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill
Revenge, their betrayal only brought them hell No remorse for their deaths
No one will be spared from this fate
Hammer spikes through their hands
Penetrate the soles of their feet Plant the stakes in the ground
Raise the crosses of the condemned
Proclaim judgement with blood
Triumph for the killers of men Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill
Vengeance, the betrayers bound and hung by nails
Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill
Revenge, their betrayal only brought them hell Avenged, the crucifier has returned to kill

Falling bodies, severed heads
Pure destruction bt the mob
Butchering all that they can see Honing their insanity
Headlong into carnage without fear
Ruthless human weapons with no conscience, unaware Rampaging killers slash with furious hate
Bones are breaking blood is spilled
Mutilation feeds their hunger
Butrally killing satisfies
Relentless slaughter innards hang from their blades Disembowelment of their prey
In the bloodbath all their vile
Dreams will come to pass
Weaponized psychopathy
Headlong into carnage seeking blood
Seething minds distorted by the violence and pain Driven by adrenaline
Headlong into carnage they attack
Merciless and brutal take the head off of your neck Sweat files while throats are cut
Tendons snapping, sinew tearing
Blood pours from gaping wounds
Sadistic chaos, grips you Bones crack from heavy blows
Fractured cheekbones, shattered skull
Bludgeoning without remorse
Eyes bulge and spurt out blood Extensive killing many thousands have died
Bodies rotting stench of death
Desolation as the killers
Scavenge the corpse of the slain Insane desire, killing cannot end
Psychotic evil, mania
Stimulation by the blood
Searching for people they can kill Weaponized psychopathy
Headlong into carnage seeking blood
Seething minds distorted by the violence and pain
Driven by adrenaline
Headlong into carnage they attack
Merciless and brutal take the head off of your neck Here they come
No chance of stopping them now
Trudging forward
On a quest, for human flesh
Panic is a catalyst
They crave limbs, to rip and twist
Now soon to be within, their grasp Run, the chase begins
Terror, they're closing in
Must attempt to refrain from defeat
Done, fallen to the ground
Clawing, disturbing sounds
Can; t escape the gnashing of their teeth Tearing off the outer skin to invade the inside
Sanguinary mastication now the pain is increased
Slashing of the arteries, completely defiled
Bleeding out and soon to rot, carrion feast They cannot stop the craving for more blood! 2x Attacking with no sign of remorse
Nothing can stop this showing of force
A virulent onslaught, rotten, decayed
As they continue to feed on the corpse
Attacking with no sign of remorse
Nothing can stop this showing of force
A virulent onslaught, rotten, decayed
As they continue to feed on the corpse Onward, to feed
Never will the cycle end
Only bones are left behind
Cannot stop this craving for more blood! Climbing the mounds to escape from death
Ten thousand left to rot
In this gorge Bodies lie
Putrety
I wont die Suffocating stench of corpse's warfts
Up from the bits of deaths
Fumes disgorge Rancid heap
Walls steep
Vapors creep Underneath
Putrid tide
Rotted body
Land Slide
Genocide
Mountains of dead mark the place where they died, they died Transfixed with horror as the corpses fall
Flesh sloughs off as I try to grasp
Start to slip Suffocate
Corpses weight
Steals my fate Underneath
Putrid one
Rotted body
Land Slide
Genocide
Anguish eternally fixed in their eyes
Rotted body
Landslide
Avalance of cadavers down the mountainside Slide

Smother me with rot
Remains are crushing me
Decomposing mound This is where I die
Nameless dead my witness Slide
Genocide
Anguish eternally fixed in their eyes
Rotted body
Landslide
Avalanche of cadavers down the mountainside Twisting limbs until they break
Contortions wrenching pain
Joints are hyper extended opposite
Fibrous tendons snap Bent backwards and broken
Hateful physical control
Opposite ways, elbows bend and pop
Fingers cracking, connective tissue torn Unrelenting warping strain
Knees are shattered
Sinew ripped from bone, ankles give way
Back is arching, spinal pressure builds
Total collapse Predacious entanglement, form is distorted
Grotesque rearrangement, body contorted
Splintering bones causing internal bleeding Abundance of injuries, pain is exceeding
Every joint in the body is turned the wrong way
A debt to the nemesis forcibly paid Arching the back, vertebrae crack
Fracture the spine, can't realign
Torque on the neck, structure is wrecked
Amorphous blob, an end to macabre A torturous lesson in physical terms
The only way some people learn
Stretching the body in every direction
Forcing the joints unnatural flexion Twisting limbs until they break
Contortions wrenching pain
Bent, bent, bent, backwards and broken Violence is legitimate is causes such as this
Vengeance will be dealt out with ruthless iron fist
Cruel retribution is fitting
Worthless filth recieve no mercy They deserve to die
They deserve to die Plans have been completed and the time is drawing near
Punishment will be relentless They deserve to die
They deserve to die Beaten senseless, sense they never had
Vacuous faces hammered into mash
Merciless smashing shatters teeth and bone Ignorance earned every crushing blow
Killing has just started and my lust for blood will grow
Stupid as they are they didn't know the seeds they'd sown
Justice will be found in murder Grew into my savage hatred 
They deserve to die
They deserve to die
Skull is fractured by the pounding Eyes dislodging from their sockets
Brains spill out, the skull is split through
Mind vacent, now cranium too
Guilty thoughs will not infect me Soulless scum recieve no pitty Forked like a snake now on the ground they lay
Deceptive tounges hewn by my blade
They had no conscience so there is no loss
For my redemption there must be a cost
They deserve to die
They deserve to die
DIE! Skull fragments are flying through the air
Brains and blood scattered just about everywhere you look
Swing of the hatchet gives permanent damage,
Head fractured, gaping hole
To incise the cranium Slit open crushed eyeballs dripping hanging from the sockets
Steel cracked bone with fatal trauma to the cerebellum
Useful lust of gore Hatchet to the head Rekindled gore obsess rend the weak
Mutilate then murder consciously
Death brought to the enemies of the past
A life of beheading I must have
Pure revenge is burning inside me Slit open crushed eyeballs dripping hanging from the sockets
Steel cracked bone with fatal trauma to the cerebellum
Useful lust of gore Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head Forced from deep inside to hunt you
Bludgeoned torn apart veins erupted
Forever headless rotting corpse
Recognition you are now beyond Wretched, onslaught, slaughter Faceless flesh remains from the victims
Hacked with brutal force until slain
Consumed with anger, lunacy
Relentless killing dependency Slit open crushed eyeballs dripping hanging from the sockets
Steel cracked bone with fatal trauma to the cerebellum
Useful lust of gore Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head
Hatchet to the head Chop it off! Captured by the priest of evil
Deep inside the hive
Hellish dungeon filled with undead
Their rotting claws reaching for my
Legs i hang above the ghouls
I know they want me for their food
Overwhelmed by deadly fear
Hung above the zombie lair Hanging by a thread above them
Taken here to die
Rotting hands reaching for me
Their undead eyes see me as a meal
They want to eat alive
Mindless hunger in their eyes
Filthy claws grasp at my feet
Slashing wounds my ankles bleed Pit of zombies
Chasm teeming with undead
Death is grisly
Lowered slightly now they reach me
I scream in frantic pain
Tearing off my feet with fury
The pain intense below my knees my
Legs have been removed
They suck the blood from the wounds
Voracious zombies rend my thighs
They pull me down, my corpse they
Will divide Pit of zombies
Chasm teeming with undead
Their jaws await me
A gruesome end the
Pit of zombies
Reanimated to devour
I watch them kill me They claw at my face
And rip off my scalp
Exposing my skull
Arteries severed
Gushing blood showers them drives
Them mad raging mob
A hideous feast Puncture my stomach and
Tear out the guts
Devour entrails
Rotting zombies have torn me apart
They gorge on my flesh Engulfed
Consumed
This pit
My doom Engulfed alive
Consumed by death
This pit of zombies
My doom is here Pit of zombies
Chasm teeming with undead
Their jaws await me
A gruesome end the pit of zombies
Reanimated to devour
I watch them kill me Bodies are bursting apart
Volcanic eruption of guts
Exploding cadavers bring forth
A bloodbath to torment all life The sky and the earth are now tainted by
Blood
Death is to blame for this enormous
Flood
The bodies are bursting apart
Volcanic eruption of guts Detonate, polluted, pandemic
Unburied decedents that no longer die
Dispelled amok amongst sickness
The dead and living are one
When dormant bodies are bursting The sky and the earth are now tainted by
Blood
Death is to blame for this enormous
Flood
The bodies are bursting apart
Volcanic eruption of guts Infernal, disaster, revulsion Dormant bodies bursting Bodies are bursting apart
Volcanic eruption of guts
Exploding cadavers bring forth
A bloodbath to torment all life The sky and the earth are now tainted by
Blood
Death is to blame for this enormous
Flood
The bodies are bursting apart
Volcanic eruption of guts Detonate, polluted, pandemic Vicious thoughts will overpower
His virulent mind explodes
Unable to suppress the madness
He can't contain this inner pain
Compelled to Lacerate
Rendering for release
Set free souls through holes in their skin
Murdered, or have they been saved Bleeding corpse his work of art
Human flesh a canvas
Craftsman of macabre creations
He can't control it makes him whole
Compelled to Lacerate
Rendering for release
Slicing through victims and then he stands back
To admire what he has done
Mutilate
Ruptured figures sprawl
Slaughtered in a rage now left to be found
A gristly gift of art Mangle them ripping death lacerate them Stunning victims with a club abducted with
Stealth taken to his home
Ropes and chains restrain his living subject of art
He stabs
Grating with a jagged edge his prey screams in pain
Writhing under his knife
Driven to improve his victims through gruesome
Design, he cannot stop
Compelled to Lacerate rendering for release
Mutilate now it's time to slice Mangle them ripping death lacerate them Lacerate from release
Slicing through victims and the he stands back
To admire what he has done
Mutilate
Ruptured figures sprawl
Slaughtered in a rage now left to be found
A grisly gift of art Trying to conceal his murders the
Maniac
Stabs the heart
Stops the flow
Cleaning up the blood's a problem he
Now solves
Hooks through heels
Hung and bled Corpses are suspended by their feet
Swaying dripping bloody piece of meat
Fastened to the ceiling leaking gore
Splashing down to the floor Corpses he suspended turning pale
All the blood drained into his grail
Fastened to the ceiling dry and dead
Fluids of life have been shed
Hung and bled Congealing fluids fester the stench
Revolting septic gruel
Putrid slop
Licks the surface of his dungeon
A gruesome meal
Rancid feast live on death Corpses dangle lifeless gray and cold
Rotting flesh the meat hooks lose their
Hold
Stenching body falls onto the ground
Bones and flesh form a mound Sanguinary killer will not stop
Hanging dead replacing those that drop
Blood he drinks like wine their flesh
His bread in his maw dripping red
Hung and bled Oozing blood the butcher's victims
Soak the concrete
Putrefy
Halls of dread
Draped with death
Ornate crimes
Stalactites made of flesh
Festooned with innards
Gaining life
Sentient place, the stone walls
Breathe
Hungry soul
It can think
A genuine living hell
Created by
The butcher he lost control
Owner and property change their roles
Constantly feeding the gluttonous room
He once ruled the chamber
Now it's his tomb Hung by their feet
Drained of blood
Swallowed by death
Greed of this place
Bodies
Decay, devoured by evil
Slave to this hell
He creates
Undying Corpses are suspended by their feet
Swaying dripping bloody piece of meat
Fastened to the ceiling leaking gore
Splashing down to the floor
Corpses he suspended turning pale
All the blood drained into his grail
Fastened to the ceiling dry and dead
Fluids of life have been shed
Hung and bled Rapacious for pleasure scraping
Filing down with intense grinding
Harsh abrasive friction deface
Countenance now removed forever Scouring faces with flies
Tedious rasping
Painstakingly grate the skin
Insensate razing
Sanded faceless
A violent facial scrub
Malefic in nature
An art of shaving the bone
Insalubrious
Sanded faceless Rubbing off a humans visage
Enduring display of malice
With celerity they perish
Countenance now removed forever Everything gone from the head
Miasmal menace
All curves of a face are now smooth
Forced a new surface
Sanded faceless
Obscurity into black
Outrageous agenda
Sensory perception lost
Left to die in pain
Sanded faceless
Insane appearance eyeless
To calibrate the skull
Image erasing soulless
Retexturing of flesh
Suddenly to be faceless
For perpetuity Scouring faces with flies
Tedious rasping
Painstakingly grate the skin
Insensate razing
Sanded faceless
A violent facial scrub
Malefic in nature
An art of shaving the bone
Insalubrious
Sanded faceless Lying on the table dead
Coroner
Completes his task Examining the wretched stiff
Suicide
The likely cause Behind closed doors the change
Begins
Then it grows
Mutation of the cadaver
Mutation of the cadaver Coroner returns to notice
Subtle change
How can this be? Must be his imagination
The man's been dead
For several days The change continues after hours
Different face
Mutilation of the cadaver
Soon the corpse will change its shape
Who is it? Mutation of the cadaver
Mutation of the cadaver
Mutation of the cadaver
Mutation of the cadaver The coroner returns and sees
The body has truly changed
The corpse has stolen his face
And now he loses his mind Shocking evolution
Mutation of the cadaver
Hideous conversion
Mutation of the cadaver
Postmortem upheaval
Mutation of the cadaver
Awful transformation
Mutation of the cadaver
Gruesome reconstruction
Mutation of the cadaver Smashing the human horde
Crushing religious filth
Nailing invertedly the ones who plant the seeds
Of doubt
Wasting inherent truth
Confronting an inner hell
Cursing subconsciously the ones who reap the
Seeds of doubt How can humans play God when all they are are
Slaves?
Their lack of souls will lead them to an early
Grave
Condemned to live a life of unrelenting praise
Their rotted corpse remains when death replaces life Tearing the vocal chords of prophets that spoke of lies
Unwanted
They are the ones controlling the seeds of doubt How can humans play God when all they are are
Slaves?
Their lack of souls will lead them to an early
Grave
Condemned to live a life of unrelenting praise
Their rotted corpse remains when death replaces life Fearing their fate they chose a random date
When all life would cease and rapture would
Release
Trampling the meek the gospel they did speak
Foretelling demise speaking only lies Feeding the senseless souls of mindless
Inhabitants not knowing they are the ones
Consuming the seeds of doubt
Finding the source of stimulation unnurtured
Realization of fools who will always against their
Will just end their lives How can humans play God when all they are are
Slaves?
Their lack of souls will lead them to an early
Grave
Condemned to live a life of unrelenting praise
Their rotted corpse remains when death replaces life Monstrous

As I walk behind her, her scent trails to me
What is it that draws me nearer, what could it be?
Once I was normal among the sheep
Now I'm immortal, in the night I creep Searching for the one, 21, she will run, from the gleam of my blade, she has strayed
She will pay, with the only life that she now knows
Captured by the gender she loathes Now she is tied, terrified, set aside
As I prepare she stares as I tear at the garment she hides behind
Her young flesh is so divine One final deed, she will plead, I proceed
Satisfying my urge, I will scourge, as I surge through her hallowed feminine domain
From her young body. I can't abstain Lifeless she now lies, now untied I defile
Carefully scoring her skin I begin from within
Removing her organs inspected
Still nothing detected
One way to achieve
The info that I need
Continuing to cleave
Gradually consumed
She was foredoomed
Body one big wound Now I am through as I chew on the few pieces that remain
Of the brain, nothing gained, I continue my
Searching in the night for the one who fulfilly my plight Searching for the one, 21, she will run from the glean of my blade, she will pay
Nothing left to mutilate
Nothing left to mutilate
Eyes tied tight forever
Mouth wired shut forever
Body parts dissever. You will see no more
Never. Lowerd into the ground
You will never hear another sound
In your coffin you are bound. Underground
Forever To the earth you're now enslaved, to the creatures long depraved
Flesh has now turned to grey, as the larve gnaw away
As you rott in your smallish tomb, insects care not how you met your doom
In your casket eternally lie. Many were pleased to see you die Fester
In the
Crypt where
You lie Victims
Pass by
They watched
You die Flesh melts off your frame. Infamous was your name
Years passed since you moved on
Nothing left but carry on
Festering in the crypt Staking out the residence
Of the chosen target
Entering the empty home
Lace the food with poision The hapless victim never had a chance
Precise contamination killed him fast Shocking news traveld fast
But I have traveled faster
The only clue thats left behind
Poision in the cadaver Cyanide assassin is my trade
Exacuting methods are my quarry's bane
Toxic killing tactics stop your breath
Precision dosage leaves the victim dead
Cyanide assassin Life, my task to end
Death, I dont regret Analyze the next assignment
Select the proper tools
Gas will be the most effective
That is what i'll use Release the vapors in the victims room
Sleeping chambers fast become a tomb
Calculated venting should work fast
Enclosed space filled with poision gas
Cyanide assassin Life, it should end fast
Death, he now should pass
Gasping, he fights for air
Face, fixed with dispair
But the end does not seem close
Misjudged the lethal dose
I must return, my works not done
He's still alive, but to weak to run A sloppy job must be finished
Can't leave him in a coma
With my mask I wont smell
The almonnd like aroma
With syringe in hand I walk into his room
He's struggling with the damage from the fumes
I plunge the needle deep into his vein
Completion of the murder ends his pain
Cyanide assassin 

Every day blows by in a world of corrupt addiction
With life comes pain withdrawals and deformation
Breaking the mould human appearance
Contorting bodies with chamical interference The guilty one, Innocent she now cries
A life of hell, Better off to die
Born without eyes, Hands, and a half a brain
Being born addicted to cocaine Living monstrosity
A freak for life they'll always be
Never knowing love or hate
Only pain the drug creates Some say she's naive, She's a stupid bitch
Some say to forgive, Guilty she should die The beginning of the end begins at birth
Breeding masses of twisted screaming flesh
An example we should make out of theses creators of misfortune
A serious crime that should not be forgiven The guilty one, Innocent she now cries
A life of hell, Better off to die
Born without eyes, Hands, And a half a brain
Being born addicted to cocaine Creating a life only to destroy
Saved from a life of the unemployed
Where crime is the only way to survive
Which is the best to be dead or alive?
Maybe a chance but maybe not
Born to be thrown in the trash to rot
To exist in this world may be a mistake
The one who is with child, It's their choice to make Death and life taken so easily
Right or wrong, Whose choice will it be? Abortion, When it is needed
Execution, For those who deserve it
The giving and taking of life will always be
Altering the future Look into the future to prepare us for our fate
Controlling our existence with every life we take Life for a life should remain the rule
The innocent victim that is what's cruel
Look to the past is what we should do
When justice was done and justice was true
Using our laws to help their escape
An easy way out is what they create
Claiming insane is the way to freedom
People are stupid enough to believe them Death and life taken so easily
Right or wrong, Whose choice will it be? Abortion, When it is needed

The giving and taking of life will always be Labelled a creation of evil
Ridiculed for their shocking appearance
Sharing both pleasure and pain
Two minds, Two hearts, One soul
Separating mentally
An illusion of privacy
Together, They absorb each other's lives
As One, They will live and they will die
A living hell has begun Displayed as a nightmare
Criticized through words and eyes
As they stare
To the normal it seems grotesque
Connected by a bond of flesh
Two minds, Two hearts, One soul
Separating mentally
An illusion of privacy
Together, They absorb each other's lives
As One, They will live and they will die
A living hell has begun Revengeful corpse out to kill

Vomit for a mind, Maggots for a cock
With his axe the corpse will chop Stare into his eyes

The unexpected I sometimes fear
Just when I feel there's no excuse for what happens
Things fall into place
I know there is no way to avoid the pain that we must go Through
To find the other half that is true
Destiny is what we all seek
Destiny was waiting for you and me I believe behind confusion awaits the truth for us
Past the obstacles we face
I value our life and trust
Years of questioning why things happen the way they do in life
Wishing that I could turn back time
So we could join our souls
I know there is no way to avoid the pain that we must go Through
To find the other half that is true
Destiny is what we all seek
Destiny was waiting for you and me In the dark of night.
Abusing a portion of light
While others are sleeping
And some are escaping
A serpent spews out fantasy
Unjustified blasphemy
That cannot be condoned It must be strange to not have lived
So far into existence This is not a test of power
This is not a game to be lost or won
Let justice be done There will be zero tolerance
For the creator of hallowed intentions
There will be zero tolerance
Fate is your deciding God Karma comes crashing down
Leaving a very deep scar
Exposing a door to the
Source of a verbal whore
Machines supply the altar
Where virtuous lives are sacrificed It must be strange to not have lived
So far into existence This is not a test of power
This is not a game to be lost or won
Let justice be done Brought to this world to wither again
Naive about the ways of life is what they say
Millions live millions die, More are yet to come
Living skeletons, Where they come from Born dead into this world
To starve and rot in agony
Born dead into this world
It's their choice, Why can't you see Life of misery, Soon a corpse you be
As bones show through, Nothing you can do Relief does not exist
When you are born to die Disease spreads fast across their dying world
Many cemeteries they will have to build
As process goes on for many years to come
A human waste land created when they are done Born dead into this world
To starve and rot in agony
Born dead into this world
It's their choice, Why can't you see There is a mask
That covers up one's true intentions
Once removed, things become very clear
Analyze behavior patterns to see beneath
The person that is presented to you
Vulnerable through trust
Life is a twisted maze of obstacles
Presented by people with a secret face What's on the outside
Is not always all that is real
Live by caution, what I feel
When things are reversed
People are shown for what they are
The truth is revealed
Banish the false
Pacifying moments with an acquired disguise to obtain
The things they want
By the anguish of someone else
Materialistic motives are fulfilled
Cherish the true
Vulnerable through trust
Life is a twisted maze of obstacles
Presented by people with a secret face Ashes and promises share a bond
Through the winds of change
Words are blown away
When visions that should be
Are tattooed in your mind
The power to let go
Is sometimes hard to find The answer cannot be found
In the writing of others
Or the words of a trained mind
In a precious world of memories
We find ourselves confined Claws so razor sharp
Ripping at the spirit Promises a potential to hurt
Is anything real?
When forever is to be until
Deep inside, in the world of empty words.
No escaping from those haunting
Empty words. Do you ever feel it?
A craving that is so strong
To by thought rewind in order to find Expectations that shined through the doubt
That soon would turn into the price
Of what a word will be worth
When tomorrow comes
To be and we are left
Standing on our own
And seeing what is real. The answer cannot be found
In the writing of others
Or the words of a trained mind
In a precious world of memories
We find ourselves confined Claws so razor sharp
Ripping at the spirit
Promises a potential to hurt
Is anything real?
When forever is to be until
Deep inside, in the world of empty words.
No escaping from those haunting
Empty words Born into darkness
Where sounds portay the images that are out
Out of reach from my sight
Which has been denied
Hands change into my eyes
Body senses intensified
Sight so close yet far away In dreams my thoughts take their form
To give memories identity
Through dreams I obtain
The ability to connect sight with sound Close your eyes and imagine to be without
What we take for granted every time we open eyes
A permanent shadow to never step away
Feel the dark in the cold
Feel the warmth of the light
Which has been denied
Hands change into my eyes
Body senses intensified
Sight so close yet far away
In dreams my thoughts take their form
To give memories identity
Through dreams I obtain
The ability to connect sight with sound In your dreams
The pain is so real
Before the dead
You'll have to kneel
Hear your future screams
See your epitaph
As you scream
The dead they laugh Pain, Growing stronger
Life, Exists no longer
Welcome, To a world of pain
Death and despair Denial of life 
Vile denial
Denial of life
Denial of life Created by your mind
To overtake your life
Sacrificial suicide
End it with a knife
Much too late
To change your mind
A bloody corpse
Is left behind Pain, Growing stronger
Life, Exists no longer
Welcome, To a world of pain
Death and despair Denial of life 
Vile denial
Denial of life
Denial of life With chainsaw in hand
Your death I demand
Slicing through your fat
My awaited gore attack Manipulating lies
Is your way of life
Riding on cheap glory
Your life is getting gory Watch you bleed to death
Gasping for last breath
Choking on your blood
I shit onto your guts Sacrificial cunt
I despise
Sacrificial cunt
No more lies Slabs of fat
Lay on the ground
Ram an axe
Into your mound Time to pay the gruesome price
A stupid cunt we sacrifice Watch you bleed to death
Gasping for last breath
Choking on your blood
I shit onto your guts Sacrificial cunt
I despise
Sacrificial cunt
No more lies Sacrificial cunt
I despise
Sacrificial cunt
No more lies Extending a life with total resistance

Too much to say from a person with no respect
Your accusations you will regret
From the mentally blind come ideas that are poison
Take away the power, A shallow person you will find What would you do without your pathetic narrow-minded Approach to life

Never mind the possibilities
Too busy for logic or to calculate Take part in a diminishing breed
Where complex turns to simplicity
When pain is acknowledged
Frivolous calculations will be abolished Without judgement, what would we do?
We would be forced to look
At ourselves emerged in lost time
Assuming what may be
Without judgement
Perception would increase a million times Distracted by the imagination
That experiments with ease
If you could taste it, it might be addictive
Where life will crush those who defy Take part in a diminishing breed
Where complex turns to simplicity
When pain is acknowledged
Frivolous calculations will be abolished Without judgement, what would we do?
We would be forced to look
At ourselves emerged in lost time

Perception would increase a million times I told you once but I will say it again
When you live the flesh it's the beginning of the end It will take you in, it will spit you out
Behold the flesh and the power it holds Passion is a poison laced with pleasure bitter sweet
One of many faces that hides deep beneath It will take you in, it will spit you out
Behold the flesh and the power it holds Touch, taste, breathe, consumed Deja vu, already knew from the first encounter
But now I know to let go of words to speak no more Like a wind upon your face you can't see it but you know it's there
When beauty shows its ugly face, just be prepared Passion burns like fire carried by the wind
The end of a time, a time to begin It will take you in, it will spit you out
Behold the flesh and the power it holds It's build you up one way and tears you right back down
A time to begin the end of a time It will take you in, it will spit you out
Behold the flesh and the power it holds Touch, taste, breathe, consumed Deja vu, already knew from the first encounter
But now I know to let go of words to speak no more Like a wind upon your face you can't see it but you know it's there
When beauty shows its ugly face, just be prepared Always blocking the doors to your mind
Escaping reality that surrounds you
Using faith an excuse to kill
A sick way of life is now revealed All the prayers in the world can't help you now
A killer a taker of life is what you are Speak no more lies
It's your turn to die Preach the good word
Speak no more, prepare to burn
A justified torture?
From this may others learn
The life you took a holy death, a grave mistake
No changing your mind, your life you should pay Practice what you preach
Your loved one is now deceased
Knowledge is at our hands
Never to understand Spiritual healing Blinded by twisted ways you live
Kill for religion, will the Lord forgive?
Idiocy has stricken your mind
A real-life hell you will find All the prayers in the world can't help you now
A killer a taker of life is what you are Speak no more lies
It's your turn to die Preach the good word
Speak no more, prepare to burn
A justified torture?
From this may others learn
The life you took a holy death, a grave mistake
No changing your mind, your life you should pay 1, 2, 3 Now! The number one biggest game
It's when they gain the most fame, it's like a race to the top because they wanna be boss
They don't care who they step on as long as they get along Politicians in my eyes! They could care less about you
They could care less about me
As long as they are at the end of the place they want to be
They're always wearing? styles, they like the clothes with those stlyes Politicians in my eyes! Always tryin to be slick when they tell us the lies
They're responsible for sending young men to die
We have waited so long for someone to come along and correct our country's law, but the waits been too long Sure they think they can? but when they lie on debate
They keep the? at bay
I met a man named Jose, but when they? his? that's when they have all their fun Politicians in my eyes! They're always tryin to confess, just like we don't have no sense
They're just as likely to? but they don't do stupid things
They'll tell you truth up and down, because you're never? Politicians in my eyes! Reaching out, shaking hands
Making friends and other plans
Some will rise, some will fall
Some won't even answer calls
Lookie here, see them fight, see the twinkle in their eye
Politicians tell me why, can't you hear the people
Cry? Yeaaaaaaaah araaaaaagh! Bodies deformed way beyond belief
Cast out from their concerned society
Flesh contorting day after day
Freak of the dark world is what the people say Their lives decay before their eyes
There is no hope of cure
Among their own kind they live
A life that's so obscure
First an arm and then a leg
Deterioration grows
Rotting while they breathe, Death comes slow Leprosy will take control and bring you to your death
No chance of a normal life to live just like the rest
Leprosy will spread with time, your body soon to change
Appearance becomes hideous a sight too much to take Tuberculoid the most severe
Decay of the nerves comes fast
Sense of feeling soon to be gone
Life will never last No hope of recovery after the nerves are eaten away
Damage is done you feel no more pain
Bones decay deterioration grows
Origin of this horrid disease nobody knows Their lives decay before their eyes
There is no hope of cure
Among their own kind they live
A life that's so obscure
First an arm and then a leg
Deterioration grows
Rotting while they breathe, Death comes slow
Leprosy will take control and bring you to your death
No chance of a normal life to live just like the rest
Leprosy will spread with time, your body soon to changel
Appearance becomes hideous a sight too much to take Go against the ways and experience pain
Leading a life which one might call insane
Bathe in the blood of the one you killed
Slaughter to survive, Your needs are fulfulled Using horrid waste
Some of them will taste
Removing deadly disease
With such primitive ease Cannibals practising the art of butchery
Emotions don't exist, Pain you can't resist Primitive ways Conducting ceremonies to meet the ancient ones
While having an outer body experience
Celebrate the kill of the day
Then walk among the guts of the fallen prey Using horrid waste
Some of them will taste
Removing deadly disease
With such primitive ease Cannibals practising the art of butchery
Emotions don't exist, Pain you can't resist Those who are a waste of life
Use up air that others could breathe
Human leaches all around
superior is what they believe Fake is the word you represent
Your existence on earth I resent
At the cost of others you get by
Each word that you speak is a lie Low life, That's all you'll ever be
Lies in effect, That's what you like to see Hiding behind material values
That help cover up your weakness
Never to change, always to look
For an easy way out of life A pathetic excuse for a human being Nothing to back you up, never giving second thought
Thinking you fool the world, into seeing something you are not
Fake is the word you represent
Your existence on earth I resent
At the cost of others you get by
Each word that you speak is a lie
Low life, That's all you'll ever be
Lies in effect, That's what you like to see Drifting into the lives
Seep into the soul
Where emotions hide Dark skies were beating me down with shadows
Of deceit, slashing at trust till it forever bleeds
With doubts, with pain, with trust, is pain When you think of me, in your multidimensional mind
Try and wash the evil from your mind and open it When you taste the truth you will see like others
Before me to you, I am past a story to tell to you
I am past a story to tell, tell it If you think you own the end
Take another look at the script of sadness
Etched in the book Dark skies were beating me down with shadows
Of deceit, slashing at trust till it forever bleeds
With doubts, with pain, with trust, is pain When you think of me, in your multidimensional mind
Try and wash the evil from your mind and open it When you taste the truth you will see like others
Before me to you, I am past a story to tell to you
I am past a story to tell, tell it What pain will it take?
To satisfy
Your sick appetite
Go in for the kill
Always in sight, prey
The time always right, feast
Feed on the pain, taste Sorrow made flesh, sweet
Live how you want
Just don't feed on me
If you doubt what I say
I will make you believe Shallow are words From those who starve
For a dream not their own to
Slash and scar
Big words small mind
Behind the pain you will find a scavenger Of human sorrow
Scavenger Abstract theory
The weapon of choice used by a scavenger
Of human sorrow
Scavenger
So you have traveled far
Across the sea
To spread your written brand
Of misery
Always in sight, prey
The time always right, feast
Feed on the pain, taste
Sorrow made flesh, sweet
Live how you want
Just don't feed on me
If you doubt what I say
I will make you believe
Shallow are words
From those who starve
For a dream not their own to
Slash and scar
Big words, small mind
Behind the pain you will find a scavenger
Of human sorrow
Scavenger
Abstract theory
The weapon of choice used by a scavenger
Of human sorrow
Scavenger To the world around he was the perfect person
Planning for an alibi he then starts rehearsing
A human bomb just waiting to explode
This secret rage can't be controlled Slaughtered the dreams of others
On left to recover
Self-inflicted wounds
Life he has comsumed Planning a killing spree
Victim of a conspiracy? Getting bored with his current life
Rearranging with a knife Greed before despair suspicion starts to grow
His life was spared for this he does not know
Screams filled the air there was no way to help
The ones he mourns he killed himself Slaughtered the dreams of others
On left to recover
Self-inflicted wounds
Life he has comsumed Planning a killing spree
Victim of a conspiracy? Your existence is a script
Life for you is a perfomance
Play out the leading role
Directing and premeditating every move
That creates the act of manipulation
Mastering the art of deception
That increases your sick addiction
It's an overactive imagination
That enslaves your empty shell Existing in dimensions of addictive obsession Your script will run short of ideas
The story will soon end itself
People to trust come short in number
Like a plague your lies spread
Fast across the world
Mastering the art of deception
That increases your sick addiction
It's an overactive imagination
That enslaves your empty shell I would describe it as
A invisible darkness
Casting, a shadow
A blinding black
Guarded, by hope
My soul is kept safe from
The bloody claws Look the way beyond
What makes it lets me see
Time after time
For needed misery My dreams my own
No price for you
I grip them tight and hope for sight You open my eyes
Wide to see
A moment of clarity
Confusion gone, it's in your hands
Your turn to ask
Why? Life is like a mystery
With many clues but with few, answers
To tell us what it is
That we, can do to look
For messages, that keep us from the truth Look the way beyond
What makes it lets me see
Time after time
For needed misery My dreams my own
No price for, you
I grip them tight and hope for sight You open my eyes
Wide to see
A moment, of clarity
Confusion gone, it's in your hands
Your turn to ask
Why? No God
Why? Built from
Blind faith
Passed down from self
Induced fantasy
Turn a page, to justify

Conjuring power it opens wide
On your seventh day
Is that how it's done?
Twisting your eyes to perceive all that you want
To assume, from ignorance
Inflicting wounds with your cross-turned dagger

Inside crystal mountain Evil takes its form.
Inside crystal mountain Commandments are reborn. All the traps are set To confine

All who get in the way
Of the divine

In sight and in mind
Of the hypocrite
A slave to the curse
Forever confined

Shatter, the myth
Don't cut yourself
On your words against dreams
Made of steel

Stronger than any faith

That inflicts pain and fear
Is that how it's done?
Twisting your eyes to perceive all that you want

To assume from ignorance
Inflicting wounds with your cross-turned dagger

Inside crystal mountain
Evil takes its form

Inside crystal mountain
Commandments are reborn

Memory's all that's left behind
As I lay and wait to die
Little do they know
That I hear their choice of life End it now, it is the only way
Too cruel, that is what they say
Release me from this lonely world
There is no hope
Why don't you Pull the plug
Let me pass away
Pull the plug
Don't want to live this way Once I had full control of my life
I now behold a machine decides my fate
End it now, it's all to late What has now been days, it seems like years
To stay like this is what I fear
Life ends so fast, so take your chance
And make it last End it now, it is the only way
Too cruel, that is what they say
Release me from this lonely world
There is no hope
Why don't you
Pull the plug
Let me pass away
Pull the plug
Don't want to live this way Do you feel what I feel, see what I see, hear what I hear
There is a line you must draw between your dream world and Reality
Do you live my life or share the breath I breathe
Lies feed your judgement of others
Behold how the blind lead each other
The philosopher
You know so much about nothing at all Ideas that fall under shadows of theories that stand tall
Thoughts that grow narrow upon being verbally released
Your mind is not your own
What sounds more mentally stimulating is how you make your Choice
So you preach about how I'm supposed to be
Yet you don't know your own sexuality
Lies feed your judgement of others
Behold how the blind lead each other
The philosopher
You know so much about nothing at all It's a scheme
Theres a fiend
Why is my head spinning round in my dreams?
It's a time and a place
Why are all these lights popping up in my face? Or am I
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out There's a sign on the wall
There's a witch with a big crystal ball

Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out

All of their faces seem to be washed away Everyones talking I cant hear a thing
I'm on the moon why is the sky so green? I think I'm walking up the stairs
While I'm sitting right down in my chair
I feel so light but I'm not
Everything's turning cold but it's hot. Or am I

Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out
Freakin out Freakin out Freakin out
Freakin out Freakin out A condeming fear strikes down
Things they cannot understand
An excuse to cover up weaknesses that lie within
Lies
Laying your guilt and pain
On people that had no part in the molding of a life
That creates its destruction
Lies
Right before your very eyes
A reflection of the mistakes
To the end you will deny
Your part in the demise of a life
Lack of comprehension
Thriving on your cliche
Compelled by self-resentment Reaching into the minds of those that created
The depression in which they
In which they drowned their flesh and blood
Lies
So easy to blame the
Everlasting fear on a pathetic attempt
To justify the ending of life
Lies
Right before your very eyes
A reflection of the mistakes
To the end you will deny
Your help in ending of a life
Lack of comprehension
Thriving on your cliche
Compelled by self-resentment Wherever we go, whatever we do
Your shadow is not far behind our steps
And our breath
Protecting and watching all.
Observing spirits on the wall
What are they telling you? Following all instincts that are pure
Oblivious to time that may be the cure Sacred is the gift
That they have without knowing
Serenity is knowing it's safe
From destruction of time Maybe we could take a step back
And discover what leads us to attack
Time that is short, distance unknown
For them, each day life has just begun
Observing spirits on the wall
What are they telling you?
Following all instincts that are pure
Oblivious to time that may be the cure If I can remember, it was you who didn't wanna see my face
If I can remember, it was you who put me in my place
You get down, and I, I wanna play play play
Well I got news for you, that ain't the way it's gonna be
You thought that me and you, were just fair game
But now you're back for more, and I forgot your name
I'm sorry baby, it had to end like this
You don't try, and you take offense
Keep on knockin, keep on knockin on the door
Keep on knockin, keep on knockin on the door
Keep on knockin, keep on knockin on the door
Keep on knockin, keep on knockin on the door
I bet you're winnin, I got a long long view
For your information, there's so many things I could do
If I can help it, if what I said ain't true
Well then baby, then find somebody new
Keep on knockin, keep on knockin on the door
Keep on knockin, keep on knockin on the door
Keep on knockin, keep on knockin on the door
Keep on knockin, keep on knockin on the door
Keep on knockin, keep on knockin on the door Your face is sweaty and your eyes are red
The beats are poundin steady in your head!
You roll yourself another stick of grass
Jump on the seat and start to move your ass! You're a rock n roll victim and I know this is true
Cause I'm a rock n roll victim too The only world that ain't dull is your own
And that's a room inside your parent's home!
The wall is covered with the styles you know
You just can't live without your stereo! You're a rock n roll victim and I know this is true
Cause I'm a rock n roll victim too Sometimes we say things that we really feel
Sometimes we say things that are really real!
Establishment don't want no part of us
Except to make themselves the real big bucks! You're a rock n roll victim and I know this is true
Cause I'm a rock n roll victim too I don't mean to dwell
But I can't help myself
When I feel the vibe
And taste a memory
Of a time in life
When years seemed to stand still I close my eyes
And sink within myself
Relive the gift of precious memories
In need of a fix called innocence When did it begin?
The change to come was undetectable
The open wounds expose the importance of
Our innocence
A high that can never be bought or sold Symbolic acts, so vivid
Yet at the same time
We're invisible Savor what you feel and what you see
Things that may not seem important now
But may be tomorrow Do you remember when
Things seemed so eternal?
Heroes were so real.
Their magic frozen in time
The only way to learn
Is be aware and hold on tight I close my eyes
And sink within myself
Relive the gift of precious memories
In need of a fix called innocence
When did it begin?
The change to come was undetectable
The open wounds expose the importance of
Our innocence
A high that can never be bought or sold Where is the person that could have been
Who, what took over, when did the end begin
Should we not prepare for the uncertain
Mysteries of our life, of our destiny
See things that are not there
Intruding voices
What went wrong to their picture perfect life
They once knew, Flattering of emotions A mind shared by an uninvited stranger
Which comes and goes as choose to appear
Should we not prepare for the uncertain
Mysteries of our life, of our destiny
See things that are not there
Intruding voices
What went wrong to their picture perfect life
They once knew, Flattering of emotions One mind divided into three, For every problem a personality
Each one trying to protect, for the crisis a person they'll select
With sorrow comes reassurance, With confusion there's ignorance Deny who they are, A fantasy gone gone too far Protecting the weak points of the mind
Defensive personalities
Violent one minute calm the next
Defensive Personalities Passed down from generations, Years of pain and complication
Darkness was a punishment, Memories time cannot mend
Brutalised from the day of birth, To reality they can't return Existing in a world of three lives inside of one Protecting the weak points of the mind
Defensive personalities
Violent one minute calm the next
Defensive Personalities Crossing the line into the other side
Emerging as prisoners
To the emptiness of time To the left and to the right
From behind, they're out of sight
Plunging into a new found age
Of advanced observeillance
A worldwide, foolproof cage Privacy and intimacy as we know it
Will be a memory
Among many to be passed down
To those who never knew Living in the pupil of one thousand eyes Was it overlooked in front of all our faces?
Now, all the mistakes and secrets
Cannot be erased Viewing the blind complexity
By which laws were justified
To erase simplicity To the left and to the right
From behind, they're out of sight
Plunging into a new found
Age of advanced observeillance
A worldwide, foolproof cage Privacy and intimacy as we know it
Will be a memory
Among many to be passed down
To those who never knew Living in the pupil of one thousand eyes We are enslaved now. It comes from the depths
Of a place unknown to the
Keeper of dreams
If it could then it would steal
The sun and the moon from the sky
Beware Human at sight, monster at heart
Don't let it inside it could
Tear you right apart No guilt, it feeds in plain sight
Spirit crusher
Stay strong and hold on tight
Spirit crusher Speakin in killin words
The vicious kind that crush and kill
No mercy, its pleasure to taste the blood
That's it, blood When it's time to feed, to fulfill
The need to consume a breath
Some will rise standin tall
Breathin out all the breath from the
Voice of a soul Human at sight, monster at heart
Don't let it inside it could
Tear you right apart No guilt, it feeds in plain sight
Spirit crusher
Stay strong and hold on tight
Spirit crusher Speakin in killin words
The vicious kind that crush and kill
No mercy, its pleasure to taste
The blood Massacred, Hacked to death, My revenge
Slicing deep, Into your flesh, The pain intense
Dreams of hate, Misery, Fill my mind
Puke in your face in disgust, It's time to die You must die in pain
You must die in pain
You must die in pain
You must die in pain Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation Staring your severed head in the face
I celebrate a faggot's death, Human disgrace
Hanging your mangled corpse for display
My revenge was fulfilled upon this day You must die in pain
You must die in pain
You must die in pain
You must die in pain Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation You must die in pain
You must die in pain
You must die in pain
You must die in pain Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation
Mutilation if you're dream is shattered
pick up the glass
Don't let your head, keep running
whatever is behind you
leave it past
can't you see, what's comming,
Let the world turn,
let the world turn around.
Let the world turn,
let the world turn around.
On the wild trip,
on the wild trip around.
Let the world turn,
let the world turn around.
On the wild trip,
on the wild trip around Will you be glad when they let you off
Oh but you don't know really where you've been
Make believing what they think is real
Just tell me what exactly have they seen Can't hold on to their established mold
Because the greed will stop their ways
Coulda been just like them years ago
But then I wouldn't be livin life this day If breakthroughs keep occuring
let them in
You know that time is all we're made of
The world will keep on spinning
Let it﻿ spin
You know that time will all be made up
Sent the world on it wild wild trip
It's to far gone to even stop it now Got your life you better live it now
Before someone will have to show you how
Will you be glad when they let you off
Oh but you won't know really where you've been
make﻿ believe in what they think is real
Just tell me what exactly have they seen Decapitated head licking your cunt
Sucking all the blood from your stump
Intestinal guts taking their hold
Leaving you dead, stiff and cold Controlling the minds of the bloodthristy dead
Unholy seizure slicing through your head
Who will survive only time will tell
Dripping from your mouth comes a rancid smell
Lobotomised corpse shredding your flesh
Leaving your body a bloody mess Scream bloody gore
Scream bloody gore Inject the reborn terror, the blood comes spurting out
Another to control, add it to your count
Orders to destroy, rip and tear apart
Wishing for the end, your dead is just the start Controlling the minds of the bloodthristy dead
Unholy seizure slicing through your head
Who will survive only time will tell
Dripping from your mouth comes a rancid smell
Lobotomised corpse shredding your flesh
Leaving your body a bloody mess Scream bloody gore
Scream bloody gore Armies of the dead
Hail their leader's head
Hungry for the flesh
While it's warm and fresh Through the smoke who will see
Who will come out alive?
Now it's your turn to feel the pain
Now it's your turn to die From above and around
Observations are collected
Knowledge is taken in by curious life forms
That may bring hope from beyond
Beneath the giver of life, our sun
An examination of another kind is done A view from those who stood high
And breathing the sky
An opinion from below and from above Some were decided, some were not
A few looked away, but none forgot Misanthrope
Hater of all mankind
There is some hope
For those who own their mind
They came, they saw and acknowledged
Some good, some bad
Opinion: dangerous Stay where you are, don't get consumed
By what they created from sheer neglet
In denial of years and years of
Shattered souls
That were lost to the power of
Fragile, frightful minds A view from those who stood high
And breathing the sky
An opinion from below and from above Some were decided, some were not
A few looked away, But none forgot Look down at the body
You may see no trace of wounds
In the eye, the eye of the beholder
One cannot, assume Not a drop of blood is drawn
But you know how it bleeds
Beware of the sharp edged weapon
Called human being It is a shield of passion
And strong will
From this I am the victor
Instead of the kill I will not feed your hunger instead
I bite the pain
Looking not back but forward
I bite down Try to cover up the trail of deceit
And daggers spawned from your soul Acid the tears of remorse flow in vain
Too late for regrets
Save it for the next ill fated game It is a shield of passion
And strong will
From this I am the victor
Instead of the kill
I will not feed your hunger instead
I bite the pain
Looking not back but forward
I bite down Faster than a bullet
Terrifying scream
Enraged and full of anger
He's half man and half machine Rides the metal monster
Breathing smoke and fire
Closing in with vengeance soaring high He is the painkiller
This is the painkiller Planets devastated
Mankind's on its knees
A saviour comes from out the skies
In answer to their pleas Through boiling clouds of thunder
Blasting bolts of steel
Evils going under deadly wheels He is the painkiller
This is the painkiller Faster than a lazer bullet
Louder than an atom bomb
Chromium plated boiling metal
Brighter than a thousand suns Flying high on rapture
Stronger free and brave
Nevermore encaptured
They've been brought back from the grave With mankind resurrected
Forever to survive
Returns from Armageddon to the skies He is the painkiller
This is the painkiller
Wings of steel painkiller
Deadly wheels painkiller
He is the painkiller
This is the painkiller
He is the painkiller
This is the painkiller
Pain, pain, killer, killer
Pain, pain, killer, killer
Can't stop the painkiller Controlling their lives
Deciding when and how they will die
A victim of someone else's choice
The ones who suffer have no voice
Manipulating destiny
When it comes to living, No one seems to care
But when it comes to wanting out
Those with power, Will be there
Prolong the pain
How long will it last?
Suicide machine
A request to die with dignity
Is that too much to ask?
Suicide machine
How easy it is to deny the pain
Of someone else's suffering Robbed of natural abilities
In death they now seek tranquility
In a confused state of mind
Extending agony, They must be blind
Manipulating destiny When it comes to living, No one seems to care
But when it comes to wanting out
Those with power, Will be there
Prolong the pain
How long will it last?
Suicide machine
A request to die with dignity
Is that too much to ask?
Suicide machine Where is the person that could have been
Who, what took over, when did the end begin
Should we not prepare for the uncertain
Mysteries of our life, of our destiny
See things that are not there
Intruding voices
What went wrong to their picture perfect life
They once knew, Flattering of emotions A mind shared by an uninvited stranger
Which comes and goes as choose to appear
Should we not prepare for the uncertain
Mysteries of our life, of our destiny
See things that are not there
Intruding voices
What went wrong to their picture perfect life
They once knew, Flattering of emotions The journey begins with curiosity
And envolves into soul-felt questions
On the stones that we walk
And choose to make our path
Sometimes never knowing
Other times knowing too much Filtering out the bad that holds us back.
Take hold of what is true to your hunger
A hunger that will not go away
Plans for tomorrow, they will remain Won't you join me on the perennial quest
Reaching into the dark, tetrieving light
Search for answers on the perennial quest
Where dreams are followed, and time is a test No time for mental crutches
The maker has moved on
I will take it raw and be on my way Those that stood beside me
I'm glad you understand
Behind these written words
I share the simple plan
To hang on to the way that we feel From rivers of sorrow
To oceans deep with hope
I have travelled them
Now, there is no turning back
The limit, the sky
I ask my questions: Why? What today?
When tomorrow? Filtering out the bad that holds us back.
Take hold of what is true to your hunger
A hunger that will not go away
Plans for tomorrow, they will remain To forgive is to suffer Throughout our time a thought escapes us
To enforce a word, no
Holdin on to pain it may seem to some The easy way to say okay
Twist your knife a little deeper
Words so sharp actions dark
Hide your blade like a Incomprehensible Enforce the words no more
Be free
Alone you might just find serenity To forgive is to suffer
To accept another day
We choose to give away
Another piece of life
To forgive is to suffer Once or twice is kind
Three or four is blind
It is not the end, yet a way to begin
The power of words both good and bad The easy way to say okay
Twist your knife a little deeper
Words so sharp actions dark
Hide your blade like a Incomprehensible Enforce the words no more, be free
Alone you might just find serenity To forgive is to suffer
To accept another day
We choose to give away
Another piece of life Trapped in a lost world of brutality So weak are the ones that must rely on shock to push this so called force that inspires their call
to be extreme so it seems is a mental crutch
To cover up for those that are completely out of touch
Say what you want, I know the truth when it comes to your kind In time we'll see who lasts
In time you will disappear
Who are you to question my sincerity
For now you are high on yourself
Drowning in your dreams of misguided hope
To be extreme so it seems is a mental crutch
To cover up for those that are completely out of touch The world will never be free
The world will never have peace
The world will never be free
Because we are not one The world will never be free
The world will never have peace
The world will never be free
Because we are not one
One, one, one, one I looked behind my back and there he was
His screaming eyes could not be so bright
He was not stranger looking than you or me
With different thoughts and that wasn't right This is the story of the world
Where actors come, and actors go
You are not trusted till you know
And even then you are alone Sometimes a man is judged by the way he thinks
And this is why the world is not one
but can not see
Taking no excuse because there's none Our world is in the hands of fools
So many others besides you
They seldom give, but always take
There's only so much you can do
I used to of do it Jack
Everything that it can not see
And no one wants to stand uW and say they're wrong
So private's right before honesty This is the story of the world
Where hide and seek's a way of life
Hide from everything that's real
And seek what others say is right Messenger of evil
Haunting your soul
Laying in peace
Taking my corpse Demeaning it was hell
Graveyard of death
Trying to resist it
Slow unholy breath Beyond the unholy grave
Beyond the unholy grave
Beyond the unholy grave Screaming in silence
Within mystery
Inside is spilled
With your Brain Demeaning it was hell
Graveyard of death
Trying to resist it
Slow unholy breath Beyond the unholy grave
Beyond the unholy grave
Beyond the unholy grave Beyond the unholy grave
Beyond the unholy grave
Beyond the unholy grave.
For anyone with a dream, this album is for you!
Mysterious object of flight on a voyage
To correct what they have done, What we are doing
Perhaps submerged, Living in the inner most
Recesses of the planet, No choice but
To adapt to an underground world
Limiting our passages of thought
Are they the examples of regression
A life form's abusive progression
In a realm so vast, We sit among the Vacant Planets So many worlds yet to be seen that once have shared
The same effects that come from greed, Mass production
Perhaps submerged, Living in the inner most
Recesses of the planet, No choice but
To adapt to an underground world
Limiting our passages of thought
Are they the examples of regression
A life form's abusive progression I want to watch you drown in your lies
The end of your masquerade, A matter of time
Interwining lies, Domination, control
Feed his twisted nature
It is sickening to see dreams die
A word of advice, Fate's patience is growning short
Fake down to your mind and appearance
You will fall short of the dreams to destroy
In time you will find yourself trapped in a corner
These four words my friend, I promise you will not forget I am one of many that see through your lies
Hiding will do you no good, many seek revenge
Soon to become a victim of what you live to create, And cannot have
It is sickening to see dreams die
A word of advice, Fate's patience is growning short
Fake down to your mind and appearance
You will fall short of the dreams to destroy So quick to judge, so easily we forget,
What it's like to be dissected
Where feelings are tossed aside
Like a drug it feeds the imagination of minds that go Unparalyzed
Followers to the leaders of mass hypnotic corruption
That live their lives only to criticize
Where is the invisible line that we must draw to create Individual thought
Patterns Prisoners of mental deception be free within singular Judgement
Twisting words to control the masses
To cover up one's self insecurities
Like a drug it feeds the imagination of minds that go Unparalyzed
Followers to the leaders of mass hypnotic corruption
That live their lives only to criticize
Where is the invisible line that we must draw to create Individual thought 

Book of the dead, pages bound in human flesh
Feasting the beast, from the blood the words were said
I am unseen, dreamt the sacred passage aloud
Trapped in a dream of the necronomicon Seven lords of an evil and fatal force
Levitate through the secret and ancient doors
Unbegun, premenating bizarre
Swept away to the castle of Cantar Seeking the tomb, tried to possess
Immortal sleep, visions of death
Drank of the blood, water of life
Splendorous son, show me the sign
You are dead
Blanketing fear, unknown to man
Demons appear, death they command 
Dead by dawn, dead by dawn, dead by dawn
DEAD, BY, DAWN Blasphermate me We are what wars, and shall rule again
Dead by dawn, chanting death thee ancient hymm
This is not real, I am not the chosen one
Trapped in a spell of necronomicon
Torted pain, in the palace of dead
Recitate, through the passages I dreamt
Dead, dead by dawn
Dead, dead by dawn Once upon the cross Father! Why Have You Forsaken ME? Nazarene in the valley of persuasion
To receive last temptations from Lord Satan
Take a bite said the serpent, eat of it
Without no choice to do so, you cannot resist Impaled crucifixion
Compassion forgot
Eternal damnation
Once upon the cross Blasphemy laughs at thee
Jesus you've been deceived
Struggling on the cross
Gagging to breathe
Despise your god, question why
You were retrieved by the angel of light
Once upon the cross Kill him, kill him, kill him. Satan Nazarene screaming on his crucifixion
Prophecy in its final contradiction
When you die is when the lie will be believed
Upon the cross, before the world to see Impaled crucifixion
Compassion forgot
Eternal damnation
Once upon the cross Once upon the cross No lord shall stand before myself I can strike the light and see through the truth
For I'm the Deicide, Dominus, what could you do
Thou has failed you now, once again and always will
On the cross, forgotten son, a sacrifice it had to be done
Died for me, well that's too bad I don't believe
Killed by sins of the evil what I am
Your destruction, reasons of a world in pain
Blind disciple, you will never live again Wage of death, course of life
Unsematic birth of the Deicide
Eyes of pain, pleads to death
As you're put to rest Three days to rise
If he lives again he is sure to die
I killed Jesus
Just to see him bleed on his pulpis throne
I am evil
I'm the Deicide and i killed the lord
No more reasons
I will kill the world in another form I rule this world NAIL HIM 
Lead-Brain I can strike the light and see trought the truth

Entrails in the pentagram circle
Spill his blood and reversing catholic humn
Invocate the onslaught of Satan Master Lord lucifer
From behind the light thou shall rise
Drink ourselves as you feed
His offering of purity Bible bleed, hell on Earth has been achieved
Thou will fail before Lord Satan
Casting sin, pissing on their crucifix
Stepping forth into his creation Master Lord lucifer
From behind the light thou shall rise
Walk His Earth, invade in pain
His christians become the enslaved What was once is never more
Infernal Lord Father restored
Blinding priest in disbelief
Revenge onto god he has sworn Purtridness upon the earth, a waste to all mankind
Days are numbered, mark thy word, in time you will subside
Death, down to the flames of belial, in through the gates of denial
Screaming and begging for god, belong to satan now
Chained in torment, till the end of hell and heaven's reign
Suffering in your damnation forever and a day
Tribulation, destiny, the verge of your demise
Memories of all you've done, to haunt your afterlife
Hell, coming to fast to repel, into the pit of dispel
Leaving the body and soul, into the darkness you go
Uncalled by name destroy you, and naught exist no more In life the light you followed, has left you in its horror
Darken thee aspirations, upon the path you seek
The signs are all around you, dead is your god belief
Purtridness upon the earth, a waste to all mankind
Days are numbered, mark thy word, in time you will subside
Death, down to the flames of belial, in through the gates of denial
Screaming and begging for god, belong to satan now A day of death upon the cross of deceit
Impure with pleasure to bare witness to he
Death calling you to christ, human sacrifice, conviction
Down the unseen, your belief, absent god, don't exist
Go unto thou, from the dead, walk with him, he ain't there
Love in retreat, uncompelled, feel no pain, pray unfelt
Hate run in place, holy grace, contemplate, there's no god
The work of jesus was the devil in fact
His miracles were nothing more than a trap
Lies pinned upon the cross, crucify his false religion
Conviction, choking on the crucifix in his blood
Conviction, take the bullet for the love of a son Conviction, from the cross into his kingdom you go
Conviction, no more bullshit from the likes of the lord
Satanic visions bring the lord to his death
Their own disenchantment of perversions confessed
Caught, harrow in disgust, revel in your lost religion
Conviction, choking on the crucifix in his blood
Conviction, take the bullet for the love of a son
Conviction, from the cross into his kingdom you go
Conviction, no more bullshit from the likes of the lord Reaping dispel, commence to kill, nothing can stop what you call is god's will
Breathe in the ill, let upon earth, serpents of satan from fire return
Killing the lambs, rites unperformed, rivers run red with the blood of their lord
Pleading of prays, cling to the dead, bring back the christ to be slaughtered again
Empowered by blasphemy, raise the gates of hell
End of time upon the earth, your lord of lords befell
Caught up in death, back to the blade, christians destroyed and devoured in rage
Born of the devil, soulless insane, spit from the fire to feast on the saved
Behind the light, thorn of the blessed, never to bow before god to confess
Heathen to some, shadowing fiend, appointed by satan to crush his mistake
Empowered by blasphemy, raise the gates of hell
End of time upon the earth, your lord of lords befell
Bleed this world of christian blood, revelation dead
Awaken from your prophecy and tear them all to shreds
Turn the cheek and drink his blood, suffer in defeat
Fall from grace and beg before your mortal enemies
Tear out your heart, i will never pray, Fucked and forgave, don't believe what you say
Where's your god
Liar! he is dead
Liar! blasphemy
Liar! heaven sent
Liar! prey unto god, fool you to death
Tear out your heart, i will never pray,
Fucked and forgave, don't believe what you say
Where's your god
Liar! he is dead
Liar! blasphemy
Liar! heaven sent
Liar! prey unto god, fool you to death Blaspheming god, my body was possessed
The essence of their spirits are evil
Burning my flesh, inhaling no regrets
A diabolic sentence of destruction Burning I bleed, unholy incision
Mark of the beast, behold the trifixion Prepare the tool to observe my fate
Upon this mortal shell in
Satan's name I desecrate
Evil controlling the way I die
The mark is what distorts my soul beyond my sanity In the name of Satan
I condemn this image of god
I am a key! Blessed by the sign, symbolically I die
Intwist me in the lines of trifixion
Torment, semantic in design
Inflict this mortal shrine,
with pure hatred
Kill me, before my time is lived
It's all I have to give, to be thankful
Satan, entangled in my sores
Forever I am bound by your conviction Tri~ Fixion, Tri~ Fixion Prepare the tool to observe my fate
Upon this mortal shell in
Satan's name I desecrate
Evil controlling the way I die
The mark is what distorts my soul beyond my sanity Conquer god and remove his thought, crush the lord above
Bring upon our given right and rule what once was ours
Kill, spilling the blood of their priest
Back into the mouth of the beast
Death, bring them all down to their knees
Tell no one they have to believe
Die, demons of evil repel
Christ dragging his cross back to hell
You will die
Walk the realms of blasphemy, shadow in the night
Sacrificial son of god, darkness is the light
Suffrage for the sins of eve, not to understand
Masticate the inner peace never known by man
Angels of the realms of hate, predicate the plan
Demons of the underworld cast you to the damned
Wading through the agony, sanctified by god
Destined to the crucifix, on the temple mound Angels rebel, god defiant
Angels of hell, satan
Angels rebel, fuck compassion
Angels of hell, kill you
Angels of hell
A revelation that has come to life, has got you by the balls
The word of god is no longer the way, his word has been dissolved
Kill, spilling the blood of their priests
Back into the mouth of the beast
Death, bring them all down to their knees
Tell no one they have to believe
Die, demons of evil repel
Christ dragging his cross back to hell
You will die Father of death and the save your of sin, losing their grip on mankind
Refuse to go and resistance is low, the time to say no has arrived
Specter of god and redeemer of souls, lost in the splendor of hate
Buried by priests for the act of perverse and the shadow its brought on its faith
Die
Save your and god, spare me their love, follow the devil wherever i want
Savior, defeat, thou has forsaken thee, died on the cross for a lie
Your god is dead, satan arise, vengeance invoke for all of time
Reborn to bleed, casting the stone, heaven retreat, god is dethroned
Save your and self, deal what youre dealt, death in the shadows of god and his wealth
Waller in agony, onto the cross, just as him you will hang till you die
Bleed for me, bleed for your soul, you want to bleed, bleed for us more Scream out unto your god, all is achieved
Fall from your cross, guilt ways you down, no one believes that you killed your own son
Fooling yourself, waiting on god for the sign that he wants you to die
Father of death and the save your of sin, losing their grip on mankind
Refuse to go and resistance is low, the time to say no has arrived
Specter of god and redeemer of souls, lost in the splendor of hate
Buried by priests for the act of perverse and the shadow its brought on its faith
Die Fuck your gods conviction, stare it to the ground
Kill the mother of mary, crush you under thou
Go to hymn to worship him, find your way around thy kingdom
Not a friend, never said, once you're in the shrine of the christ denied
Die, die, die
Witness of death
The kingdom has you in control, a slave of their incest
Thy throne in which they stand on thee a fable to detest
Untold and underneath the truth, they want us all to die
Go against his vision, once you're in you're in
Door to door religion has you till the end Cradled in a righteous sin, defiling the light of your own belief
Christ unmused, his birth refused, scoff at his claim as the son of god
Await with death as something blessed, leave behind a world of the unconfessed
A setting sun, it will be done, god obsessed, witness of death
Go to hymn to worship him, find your way around thy kingdom
Not a friend, never said, once you're in the shrine of the christ denied
Die
Witness of death Sacramental ceremony
People's temple of the holy
Sepulcher for salvation
Suicidal confirmation Forgive me father for I have sinned
You will never sin again! When we meet again it will be the promised land
Death is in command to the victims of the plan
In the temple of the dammed
Drink the blood, concentrate of death
Congregation is dead Carnage of the dead
Mass cremations of the blessed
Sermonizing fatal end
In the temple of the damned Homage of unknown, origin of Mr. Jones
Of the final praise to the populated grave
In the temple of the saved
Death awaits you, to escape is to die
Carnage, blessed be the non-divine Full of shit, your fucked belief, take from me, i want your head
fill my soul with agony, pains me with a painful death
in your myth i hear your dread, hate you for so long
unbeneath the lord above, you are just a lie
lie!
never once to interfere, in the loss of human life
every time you're needed here, you are neither lost nor found
you are words that commandeer, making victims reappear
in the wake of your descent, nothing matters when you're dead
dead!
how can you call yourself a god?
how can you call yourself a god?
how can you call yourself a god?
how can you call yourself a god?
sacred words from days of old, don't support your views on death
in the list of all you gave, in exchange that we be blessed
then move on and never seen, leave us in catastrophe
thank you lord for what you've done, nothing but destroy your son
why?
how can you call yourself a god?
how can you call yourself a god?
how can you call yourself a god?
how can you call yourself a god? You are the one we despise
Day in day out your words compromise lives
I will love watching you die
Soon it will be and by your own demise Buried in hypocrisy
Lacerate your faith in god
Morally diseased
On the cross of calvary your body bashed defeated, stabbed Blessing as you hate
Loyal to your enemies
Monetary faith
As him you'll pay for the lies of your prophecy
Satan wants you dead Kill the christian, kill the christian
Kill the christian, kill the christian
Kill the christian, kill the christian
Kill the christian Armies of darkness unite
Destroy their temples and churches with fire
Where in this world will you hide
Sentenced to death, the anointment of christ In due time your path leads to me
Put you out of your misery The death of prediction
Kill the christian Kill the christian. dead! Open the door Jehovah you whore
I am the servant of who rules this world
Archnemesis of your light
One look at me and you know he is I Run away when confronted with Satan
Always here and forever will be
Your concern for my Lord is becoming
Defecate on your book of belief Door to door soliciting war
Feeble man with salvation as sword
Disturb and see you will die
For I am of Him in his world you're confined Why try? World dies, Christ hides
When Satan rules his world
Disease, run free, killing
When Satan rules his world
Religion, infliction, obscene
When Satan rules his world
Witness, dismissed, executed
When Satan rules his world Join us Evil night of an evil death

Incesting consent
Alter your life from behind the light
Master Lord Satan decides Father hypocrisy, exerting fantasy
Persuading innocent children to where you live
What is vowed does not exist, you are in debt to sin
Apologize and plead, begging god for mercy Deny resurrection, behead the nazarene son
Foredoomed holy spirit, our war at last be won
Legion crush jehovah, see through the faceless dog
Untie our world from Satan
You know it can't be done Wipe away this world of unworth
Decapitation, Satanic rebirth
Off with his head to sever his soul

Blade to my throat, I calmly greet death In Hell I burn, my faith is sustained
In Hell I burn again
In Hell I burn, no questions remain
In Hell I burn for Satan Opened eyes dream, unheavenly torture
Raping the world of the dead

Never repent. Born to be dead
Repent to die
Ignorance looms in the unconscious mind
Born to be dead
Repent to die
Waste your last breath on the lord Jesus Christ Repent to die Afraid of what lies after death
Your screams are unheard to Him
Resisting your wake of adorn
Your pleading falls deaf on your lord Go fuck your god will be my final words
To die is just the concept of living
To be Forgave, salvation blessed with pain
Endeavored is the blame of creation Pathetic lives, every second someone dies
Delightful is the sight of repention

Let us pray
When the darkness falls we will die
Endless pain
Crucifying death from above
We must pay Day of darkness Question our fate when day of darkness
Forces of evil now upon us
Forces of evil on display
Forces of holy brought this day Death is now the day
When the reaper calls for the dead
We'll be saved
In this world of desecrating minds
We must pay
Crucifying world of evil death
Let us pray Day of darkness Out of my mind into a world between
In search of the ancient artistry
Lord Kur, before your sword I see
The house of death is opening
Hanging from their primal sleep
Forbidden to be seen
Spirit of the elder gods
Are dead but must live on
Still to life and yet they breathe
Dead but dreaming. Lords of the world within the space between
Wandering receivers of a sacrifice
Lord Kur, beyond your throne you sleep
Beneath the seven cities dead
Encased in silent tombs
Immortally exhumed
Spirit of the elder gods
Are dead but must live on
Still to life and yet they breathe
Dead but dreaming. As I smear my blood on thy sword
Through the gates into lands I know not
On the road where none have returned
Come to life, Oh lords of black earth Screaming ancient incantations
Sleep unbinded by my sight
Dead but dreaming, darkloads waking
From the house of death set free Sixty demons, bow before thy
Ancient catatonia
Elder vengeance, Lord Kur take me
Darklords hear me, hung dead bleeding Bleeding death, undead, broke the seal Suhrim
Desecrate, evil ghost Thoth freed him
Mass destruction, ended lives, blasphemation, you will die 

Darkest one, bleeding death, from beyond
Death be done, no regression, unforbidden
You will die, It's been written 

Die, BLASPHEREREION
Die, BLASPHEREREION Vicious warth Adar, torted past rendered
Odious evil, elder death, feast us
God's construction, holy doom
Don't believe, you're consumed 
Lord chaos, death, save us
Kill human kind, life was denied
Lord black death, Thoth, confess
Send to desecrate, lord blasphemate 
For the heart of ours, bless what can't be blessed
Fortify the souls of those you once detest
Voices in control lead you to the cross
Is it not your wish, suffering your cause
Die
Washed away your sins on the holy cross
Wagering intent on something that was lost
Patience at your side, give into the need
No one there, you're all alone for all the world to see
Die
Scream out in blasphemy, death and its certainty
Killing yourself for free, no thank you god. Satan It don't mean shit to me, watching your Jesus bleed
He is a fool you'll see, nowhere to run
Death to humanity, savior, the enemy
Brutalized, hung to bleed, beaten to die
Spit out the cross of plagiary, devil or deity, kill everyone
God is a god of death, so is his son that he sent
Twisted entitlement hatred discard, hanging in agony
Follow the lord to the end of eternity, savior destroyed, sacrifice for the crucifix
Hang in agony until you're dead Invective death, from the hand
To write the book of evil
Terminus of the overture
Recite the role of power Schizophrenic reflex, vesicate, mutilate
Refuse the force on which you die
Myrmidon of Goethe
Abortion of angels that flee for their lives
Animated onslaught, expectorated discharge
Elegy of evil, visions of light for thou has forgotten Adulation scripture, dominate, terminate
Fascist author of Gods
Drubbing of his light fears
Bring forth the atheist, sent to inseminate
Aggravated blasphmere, insurrected one to tell
Power through defile
Mephisto is coming to claim me for hell Satan.
Take me Mephistopheles
Insurrect the shield of Satan
Grant me immortality
To rise Picture you a sight unseen, vengeance fills my head
satisfy my lust for blood when I see you dead
you were never what I would, something I won't sought
now that you are gone for good you have been forgot
feted the lord of death, as a deity
fuck you and your son of god, failure you will feast
bible the book of blood; it will be denied
servant of the enemy, its your turn to die
die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die
now I lay me down to sleep, pray no one my soul to keep, if I die before I
wake, I want your lord to stay away
guide me not or take of me, internal torment I foresee
in his name I will not know, or follow him where he shall go die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die
in the name of god leaving us alone
raining fire in my life in hopes that I'll conform
all I fear is nothing new, death is something dear
wait the hour that I go your image disappears
feted the lord of death, as a deity
fuck you and your son of god, failure you will feast
bible the book of blood; it will be denied
servant of the enemy, its your turn to die There exists a place of agony
Where children are held captive
Belt across the back, the nuns attack
Believe in God or be beaten to death Work to earn your keep, no time to sleep
You better know the Bible verse
Or go without and die of thirst
Resent your birth, thanks to God At Father Baker's, the pain is divine
If you are lucky you'll get out alive Welcome to terror, you're where you belong
Father is waiting to show you, you're wrong
Learn early on to behave or you'll die Live with his torture, no one to confide
Innocence lost by the rage he inflicts
Repent to God or the pain will persist Kept inside a cage, humiliate
Till father takes confession
Whipped unmercifully and left to bleed
And by the end to be one with God Fast you into place, the final phase
Before you meet his maker
Do as you are told or you will go
And then you'll know what is suffering At Father Baker's, the pain is divine
If you are lucky you'll get out alive Welcome to terror, you're where you belong
Father is waiting to show you, you're wrong
Learn early on to behave or you'll die Live with his torture, no one to confide
Innocence lost by the rage he inflicts
Repent to God or the pain will persist In the creation of Anu were spawned
Born of the Earth before they're known
Evade destruction in their world below
Their hands reach for our place outside
Bestow their suffering on human life
Nothing will stop them from re-entering
Return to hatred in the heart of man They are the children of the underworld
Before the heavens they were on the Earth
To desolation and were never heard
Cry rebirth
Lords of the plague, seven are they
Born in the mountain of Mashu's magic
Spirits of hate, they have no name
Withered and wicked, the liars in wait In the creation of Anu were spawned
With deadly vengeance from the ancient gods
Their place on Earth, their race unknown
Beyond the knowledge of the elder ones
Provoking with our blood to rise
The seven offspring for the sacrifice
Reclaim the power of the crown of death
Enter the body from the temple dead Satanized, crucified, feel the wrath of suicide
Incus fear on the sphere, angel darkness disappears
Covenant, blasphemous, open up unholiness
Father Satan, let me lust unholy sins Suicide sacrifice
Destruction of holy knife
Blood of unholy knife

In Torment In Hell! Liar of a priest,
What could you want from thee,
is it so hard to see,
I will not believe,
the truth it sours,
inside you hide your head,
the contradiction,
I curse your life with dread. You're dead to me,
your light is greed,
leave me alone,
to the unknown,
I have to leave,
the best to be,
beyond his gates,
without his grace. In torment in hell,
uncontrolled and casting spells,
plotting death and suffering,
binding souls with misery,
burning Christians begging pleas,
satisfy my need to bleed,
trample on the lambs of god,
bow before thy lord Satan. Stay away from god;
find out that you are,
human deity,
born to be deceived, You worship cowards,
a cross for which he bled,
no more empowered,
the light of god is dead,
I fell from god,
his word begot,
unlearn his faith,
the lord replaced, Heaven is hell,
flesh is the cell,
the earth I take,
return to hate In torment in hell,
uncontrolled and casting spells,
plotting death and suffering,
binding souls with misery,
burning Christians begging pleas,
satisfy my need to bleed,
trample on the lambs of god,
bow before thy lord Satan. Liar of a priest,
What could you want from thee,
is it so hard to see,
I will not believe,
the truth it sours,
inside you hide your head,
the contradiction,
I curse your life with dread. You're dead to me,
your light is greed,
leave me alone,
to the unknown,
I have to leave,
the best to be,
beyond his gates,
without his grace. Servants of death, enchanter of pain
From the land of no return, you'll kill again
Smear the blood on naked corpse
Manson 

Lunatic of God's creation
No resist
Hear the voices of devastation There is darkness in his eyes
And you won't see it, before you die
Feel the knife of the Lord Divine's
Creation 
Give praise to Satan, he has won Cynical existence, crucifixion
You will give praise to Satan
Lord of lords, kind of kings
Spread your wings Haunted by the righteous one, bent of my repention
Crucifixion Lucifer, save me from destruction
Holy priest that can't confirm, shun the cross of evil
Violent but undisturbed, wait for thee invertion 

To break the bonds of evil
To die upon the cross
To die uncertain death
From whom you place it on 

Crucifixation, Thee unholy denominations
Crucifixation, Holy termination You will give praise to Satan Impaled vibration, Crucifixation Levitating act of death, messenger of Satan's mass
Blinded by the crucifix, sacrilegious impalement
Kill the chosen, righteous son, claim the cross inverted one
Everlasting hell damnation, from the lord, Crucifixation 
Where's my crucifix?
I can't die without it.

Cry aloud! Cry aloud!
Whirl the Wheel, O my Father, O Satan, O Sun! I saw the virgin's cunt spawning forth the snake

Break the bread. and crumb by crumb into the Leviathan's den.

Coiled underneath my throne
With Thee I reunite
With blood we make this covenant
Myself I redefine
Look in and above:
There is more than the flesh
Look careful and Thou may see
The unextinguished flame
The nectar ov Thy rage
I taste from the cup ov fornication
And woman by my side
And scarlet is her skin She's eager to rise
And so eager to please Another day
Another eternity gone
And on the stairway to salvation
I walk alone among the falling stars Looking for company
Where art Thou?
Oh, lacerate ones! Arise! my sweetest friend
Or be forever fallen
We have finally arrived
From prison ov this life
To Kali's womb
Down to the earth
As angels ov almighty god,
Chaos!
Tis our last fall
To touch our mother whore
The harlot ov the saints
That spits on the rotten cross Incinerate the icon
The symbol ov all loss
To stand straight
At the left hand ov god Samael! be Thou my ally!
Join me among the bright hosts
Wondering neither way ov light
Nor darkness
Ov which seed
Sprouts dispassionately
In the summer ov my life
La ilaha ilallah, لا إله إلا الله APO PANTOS KAKO DAIMONOS!
APO PANTOS KAKO DAIMONOS! We transgress the context of commonplaceness
We deny normality, trample morality
We destroy angels with sound
We destroy angels with silence Currents of tantric anarchy seize our bodies
Into the cosmic dance of four scythes
The curtains of absurd theatre are raised
Synchronicity, Mother Chaos on the stage Wisdom says: be strong!
Thrilling words are spreading down the spine
Vibrating.Be strong!
Exhausted, I'm running towards the last shrines of consciousness
Which is absorbed by shadows of madness APO PANTOS KAKO DAIMONOS!
APO PANTOS KAKO DAIMONOS! Here are the star and the snake servants
They rise the hexagram
Sun, in the triangle hidden, sight, sacred visions entwined
And union with nothingness, body I'll find
Strength, go along the Mars path, fighting if we must
Light, oh, you are Ahathoor, goddess of blue sky There is might of dawn, in non-quality state I remain
Of commonness crippled, time or sand, glass you don't see again
Sigillum dei, picture of myself I'm drawing
With life, venom and Hell, I'm sprinkling it
His name is Esial, I want him more Akephalos

His name is Esial, I want him more Jam ciemny jest
wśród wichrów płomień boży
lecący z jękiem w dal,
jak głuchy dzwon północy. Ja w mrokach gór
zapalam czerwień zorzy
iskrą mych bólów,
gwiazdą mej bezmocy. Ja komet król,
a duch się we mnie wichrzy
jak pył pustyni w zwiewną piramidę.
Ja piorun burz,
a od grobowca cichszy.
Mogił swych kryję
trupiość i ohydę. Ja, otchłań tęcz,
a płakałbym nad sobą
jak zimny wiatr
na zwiędłych stawu trzcinach.
Jam blask wulkanów,
a w błotnych nizinach
idę, jak pogrzeb,
z nudą i żałobą.
Na harfach morze gra,
kłębi się rajów pożoga.
I Słońce, mój wróg Słońce!
wschodzi wielbiąc Boga. I descended from the Mount Sinai
Unleashed the splendour upon a scroundel mob
To shelter where no messianic light
Drove one single ray into the pulp ov life
O sweet Salome I beckon thee
Bring forth thy heinous offering
Without your love
So incomplete
Corrupt me with your dignity I decompose in rapture ov hells
Dissolve divide disintegrate
I am yours
In euphoria below At faintest whim they would impale the sun
And thus the sheep in me became the wolf in man
I am the fly that flew forth from the ark
My thoughts like insects
Whoring wounds divine
Been bored with cosmos my dear old foe
This universe has never been enough
Compelled to liberate the spring ov life
When the levee breaks gush forth o stream ov ice I decompose in rapture ov hells
Dissolve divide disintegrate
I am yours
In euphoria below I cast my halo from perdition's clay
Behold my bliss profane
Born ov a lie
Condemned to lurk
Live in denial
Yet coiled aflame.
I am the great rebellion
Neath Milton's tomb I dwell
An existence even sin would not pardon
No guilt, no reason, saviour, or shame Ever since the Devil breathes
My steps never outweighed the gravity ov hell
So I keep praying for rain of flaming rocks
To foster the symmetry ov worlds
I had a vision ov the impenetrable darkness
Never found on either side ov the moon
It wields composure ov my soul
That comes as one with the odium below. Chant the psalm
Non serviam
Retrieve the pride
Within and without Odrzucam wszelki ład, wszelką ideę
Nie ufam żadnej abstrakcji, doktrynie
Nie wierzę ani w Boga, ani w Rozum!
Dość już tych Bogów! Dajcie mi człowieka! Niech będzie, jak ja, mętny, niedojrzały Nieukończony, ciemny i niejasny Abym z nim tańczył! Bawił się z nim! Z nim walczył Przed nim udawał! Do niego się wdzięczył!
I jego gwałcił, w nim się kochał, na nim
Stwarzał się wciąż na nowo, nim rósł i tak rosnąc Sam sobie dawał ślub w kościele ludzkim! I imagined the most ardent ray ov sun
Like vulture hovering above my neck
It burns with fever deep within my soul
Erect in gloria to sink into shame
Oh Lord, whence came this doubt?
Thou doth know I am all and everything
Let loose my shackles
Let chaos reign
Infecting moral arteries. Chant the psalm
Non serviam
Retrieve the pride
Within and without I the Sun ov man
The offspring ov the stellar race
My halo fallen and crushed upon the earth
So that I may bring balance to this world I son ov perdition
From sheer nothingness transgressed
Unto the highest self, to utmost freedom
To explore the starry nature ov my rage I pulse ov existence
The law ov nature undenied
I hold the torch ov Heraclites
So I can shake the earth and move the suns I divine Iconoclast
Injecting chaos into my veins
With life accepted
With pain resurrected
Is the embrace ov god in man profound The joy ov a dawn
The ecstasy ov dusk
Nourished have I this karmic flow
Where great above meets great below
Let it be written!
Let it be done!
Scattered I walk towards the fractured light Veto! I vomited forth
From a throat choked by rope
As lunatic mob
Shackled maimed feet
Tore asunder both wings Pluck my eyes out
Rip my tongue
Make me slave to gravity Bleed dry ov tears
Weep with blood
Leave to atrophy I sought reprisal high and low
I spew forth plagues to taint their soil
I crept under the shadow ov purity
In my hour ov pious wane
I turned to boundless catechism
Behold the anathema ov benediction
Sacrilege in Gethsemane manifest
Furor Divinus
Anointed sin became flesh Emerge The accuser ov all
Hark the universe cries forlorn
Bleeds from black lungs ov hell
Deflowered by the horns And so I reversed the wheel ov my fortune
Strike blind the eye ov the lion
With every breath stolen from their lips
I raped and raped and raped the daughters ov Zion Raise the dagger Abraham
And slit the throat ov thy only son
Reverse the history ov man
Fuck and reset the world Pluck my eyes out
Rip my tongue
Make me slave to gravity Bleed dry ov tears
weep with blood
Leave my cross to atrophy I believe in Satan
Who rend both heavens and earth
And in the Antichrist
His dearly misbegotten
The anguish ov our future
A Bastard spawned from lie
Born ov a harlot nun
Reign high in luxury
Aloft the kings ov man I use words sharp as a sword
To rake Saints shins bestrewn
Three days risen, the grand deceiver
I bless the world with ire and woe So, can you hoard host like Zion's coin
Belie progeny ov your pain?
IHWH, thou sayeth unto me:
Thou, disrupter, imbalance my creations!
Hence I transfix in bliss ov flagellation
I burnt in rapture, wafted ash about.
Became the law above all laws
In asymmetry ov the horns I cut loose the cord ov life
Depart celestial source
Rub mould in holy pages
Let woodworms eat the cross
I prayed I'd die in you O Lord
I pray you'd die in me. Who shall crucify the last prophets
And have them wilt on splintered stems?
Who shall churn hells across the earth
And reascend to seat himself.
At the left hand ov Satan
Be gaoler ov the living
And ov the dead
As it was in the beginning
Now and shall ever be
World without end
Amen Voice ov an Aeon
Angelus Satani
Ora pro nobis Lucifer
You alone have suffered
The fall and torment ov shame
I'll smite heaven's golden pride
And never pity thee
Immaculate divine
Satan ov Elohim
None dare to stand in your way
Thou bow to none
Ov Eden's feculence
Conjure the serpent messenger
Saviour order in world's decay
Concord in temptation
And in the fall ov eve For thine is the kingdom
And the power
For thine is the kingdom
And the glory Forever Scholar ov the unlight
Great volcano ov excrement
Rippling eager to erupt
Reconstellate the firmament
Behold the great accuser
A megalinga ov throbbing zeal
Raptor yearning to pierce
To rape the seventh seal
Destroyer ov cosmos
Implore the Ungod
Implode the sun
There is none wronging the serpent's cult
Untoched and ignored
With the serpent's might And the trumpets blow
In the shadow ov the horns For thine is the kingdom
And the power For thine is the kingdom
And the glory
Forever Lightning that stabs the Heavens
Thou quiver the mount sinai
Split rocks on tablets ov covenant Listen for the tempest's rasp

Bleeding from black holes
Whom horns caress
And whom God mourns Fly, fly high my Black Eagle
Let golden thread bind our eyes
May our minds and hearts blood unite On your wings carry me over the abyss
Beyond The Reason and across the burning seas
Then, with your claw tear the earth to the halves
And usher me into the secrets of her bowels Circle! Round and round my Black Eagle
Down to the light of the beginning and the end which shimmers
Let our senses be touched by ultimate pleasure
May the passion of hunting become all, devouring
Slash! Slash with your beak Remove all gods from my way, and thoughts, and sorrows
And let me trespass the barriers of fear
Scream! Let the whole cosmos tremble May echoes become my the sweetest mantra Spirit of Freedom! Eternal Wanderer! Joyfull Solitude!
Higher and higher towards the stars of Awareness
Let worlds of imagination and fact become one

abandoned, yet never to be conquered I never mourn, I never look back as long as Thy phosphoric rays

I, who is evil can receive no good
though I still crave, I'm yearning for
Thy healing touch ov grace. pain is timeless

Falling! Falling!
Jerusalem is falling!
Yerushalaim Nehereset! Those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them
Bring them here and kill them in front of me
Behold! As Rome burns so do I.

forever and beyond. lead: Nergal
lead: Seth forever abandoned among gods
since I have been made flesh,
and yet I challenge Thee!
canst Thou hear my battle cry? Darkness spread its dark wings
Whispers of woods were growing
With every moment
I felt them paying enormous tributes
Powers, which were still alive at night
In the battle of light with dark earth
Spirits of their own nature fight proudly
Live by my side, feed young heart of mine
But I cannot ever see them
I don't know her powers, but I know it's great!
Loves, gives birth, kills, it's powerful!
She raises beautiful monuments by the Baltic
Lives when I sleep and lives in me.
At night raises over dreaming forests
She awakes Gods and Goddesses, unsilently
The night cock she is, whispers wolfish spells
The chants of bard she knows and hums them
Goblins of oaks and denizes of darkness
Bathed in the wine of a delightfull night.
And lives there, but dies at dawn.
Dies in me with barbarous voice.
The dark forest enchant me! Arrived we to the days ov our beginning
To the City ov God clothed with the mists
Enslaved by life we danced spinning
In the taverns of time we used to sit
And drunk with memories
Dead moments glorified I saw the phantoms ov Golgotha
Legion Legion
Fed on dust ov dead
Anoited by the grey ash
Mad, twisted mob ov Jerusalem Then Raphael beyond me and night appear'd
Bent and The Word was announc'd An archangelic grreting 
Jetzirah! Jetzirah!
The sign ov Portal, reality ov nature
Not to be, but to become
In aimless wandering across the time On the sea ov possibilities untouched I stood
From my hand cracked heaven idols are falling to the pieces
Reached the horizon
Dagger in the air
Sylphs work is done
Oracles ov past aeons fulfill'd Live we on the edge ov the worlds
In titanic turn ov time
Here and beyond
Carried on the wings ov the sun
Infinite, sacred power we call
And sight hardly can catch the moment ov eternity
When drink with light
In light we will live And in the formless rapture
Will we sing psalm ov Might
The last spell ov Will:
We are one
We are none! Rise thy horns
For I'm at one with the dark
Divine presence ascends
Touching the forehead ov god Hark! I was not, I have become
In rapture, in vengeance, in blood
From word into flesh
From man into god Strive ever to more
So spake the wisdom ov snake
Hold up thyself
Sayeth the law ov the brave Beyond all I am
Let it be known
Within my blood fire stirs
Thee I invoke, The Unspoken One As the wolf among sheep yet cower I do not
Victorious, glorious, constantly thirsting
And as the anger fuels my heart and will
No longer fear that which feeble men fear No rest for conquerors! Legions of Typhon Seth await
Conquering child ov Mars breathes out war formula
Ain Soph Aur
Protect my ways
Enlighten my paths
Consume me with thy rays I, the heart ov Tiphareth is waiting
The centre and secret ov the Sun
I invoke the Sothis rites, as day and night I'm reborn
We shall all be one with the flames, from above. Kiedy moc piorunow tnie niebiosa w cieple letnie dni,
Zwracam swe oczy ku Bogom,
wspanialej i poteznej naturze,
dzlekujac za dar, ukryty w blyskow potedze.
Zimna noc zalegla nad prastarym borem,
ulewne deszcze wypelniaja drogi mej wsi,
ukrytej gdzies w glebi pomorskich lasow.
Jak strugi, deszcz oczyszcza nasza rzeczywistosc,
mamy rok dziewiecsetny. Lasy Pomorza. Wiem, ze urodzilem wlasnie tam,
zeby czynic mych ojcow kulture piekniejsza.
Wiem, ze oddalem im swoje serce,
bolem i trwoga przepelnione.
W srebrnych pasmach ksiezycowego swiatla,
woje moi przeszywaja debowe knieje,
podazamy ku rozstajom drog,
by w krwawej walce zlozyc swa ofiare.
Kolejne grzmoty burza w zorzy wieczornej,
upewniaja nas w swej sile,
To ojcowie towarzysza nam od samego poczatku,
raz pozdrowienia, raz gniewy z sinego nieba nam slac. Lasy Pomorza. Dobrze, ze bory zwierza sa pelne,
pozwala to utrzymac ma druzyne na nogach, i topory, i tarcze, i miecze ich ciezkie,
a futrzane obuwie nasiakniete krwawoczerwonym blotem.
Mijamy mile kolejne, by zdazyc do lasow,
pod skrzydlami nocy sie schowac, jeszcze jeden blysk w ciemnosci,
jak ojcowskie dobranoc uklada nas do snu. jak wilki. Lasy Pormorza. Praise to thee, Sabbath Goat
Rising from the smoke
Entheogenic god
Dwelt in inbetweeness
In quadriga sexualis
Thou art mysttery unveiled On the sun we fed
Worshiiped spirit in matter descended
Through the mists ov the highest mountains led
Out ov darkness ov ignorance
Into the light ov reality Touch and say:
This is the flesh and blood ov mine
Look: Atmospheric I:
Blessed be who have seen Fools in the slime
Their world shrills with fear
Kali Yuga: shells ov gliphoth manifest
Decline! Decline! Beyond the dead words
Going across the gnostic waste
Drifting in infinite experience
From Nowhere to Nowhere
In the dreams ov eld heard we atavistic chant:
Zos Kia Cultus: Nagual-Hoor-Lam
Certainty, not faith
Instinct, desire, and will!
Naught in all, all in naught Touch and say:
This is the flesh and blood ov mine
Look: Atmospheric I:
Blessed be who have seen By the Fire and Force
I command thee, spirits ov the deep
Thoughts, theriomorphic shades
Creep and obey me!
Demons, perfected dissolution
In non, atomic fact ov universality
This is my sweet solitude One eyed old man I am
Yet I possess the knowledge of thousand sages
An unborn child I am
Though I have existed for billion years
The invisible army I am
Though the won battle still to come
The father of ambitious and dissapointed I am
Brother in sin and abasement
I was Judas in your dream
Who worshipped money above all
I was the roman warrior
Who wounded you and drank the divine blood
I was pilate on your trial
Who spat in your pale face
Each thorn was a sinful spell
Each nail the fulfillment of the revenge
For which I have been waiting for so many years
Hatred for thousand holy heads
And also that many daggers pointed at their visages
The fallen angels, mythical daemons
Thriumphant in their blasphemy
I am Gordon, my name is annihilation
Extremination
I am the thousand plagues and afflictions I've seen strange signs on my way
Silent shadows, dancing shapes
And angels fallen on the earth
Face up and look there
When the root of Thy being cannot reach Art thou Nephilim child
Are ye looking for thy Elysium?
Here among the living trees
Among the fading stars, variability of forms Sometimes love, sometimes sadness of things
Sometimes rapture and wine of Sabbath
Sometimes hatred, divine rage
And 93 rears, no limit beyond the sin gilgolem Ye taught me the secret words
Iao Sabao
Protect thy Damion
Iao Sabao
Protect thy Damion
Iao Sabao
Protect thy Damion
Iao Sabao, Sabao Why, why whisper thoughts
But might is raised
When conjurer of seasons
Hums the song sorrowful, joyful Night is eternal
Day is eternal
With runes of life
And runes of death
As above, so below
Now it's time of the beast I break the chains of unbelief
Burden of millenial slavory
Forest, eternat wander
Extending beyond earthly dimensions Gods will return to their graces together with me
They'll find their oaken kingdoms as before
I free my powers when yelling silently
When I fight. thousands of demons, follow me! And my strength, and my spell.
And my beautiful pride,
Will find and wrap you will raise majesty to the skies.
From the depths of the earth, deep and black
Through the forests, woods and shadows,
It Will penetrate lakes and wolfish mountains.
On the wings of demons to skies! I denude golden gates of my Nawia
Shrouded in thick smoke of burnt bodies
I show my love. I praise the might
And destroy with the power of thunders
constantly destroy On my right hand, fire, eternaly devoted
Together with the strength of thunders
Will dance as before
The conflagration, death and misfortune, let it beget
Rebuild what was ruined,
Destroy what was created by the cross
And my strength, and my spell enslaved in a cloud above the vast sea
I've finished my journey through the 7 incarnations
the blaze of my glory die out for this world
as the blaze of my rustly steel died dark forests, unknown vast lands
were my home, my dream which came true
wild as eternal fear of the blackness
I live primeval life under the horned one's rules steeps resounded with the howl of the wolves
searching alone for the victim
and from the deep forest rised you chant
about the god of coldwinds and desire crushing the last wound of the crucified one
I stalked the path of the sword, fire and blood
my armies of the ships like dragons
spread fear among the holy lands altars were burning with black fire
for the master of eternal spaces
born for our blood and fiery steel
victorious wave of warfare and mayhem immortal, invincible, dark warrior
I leaded my troops through countless battles
and the scream of the dying was our pride
I split a lot of blood, stole human souls, cruel now it's time to finish my journey, to rest
I fall into oblivion with weapons
no one will feed my razor with blood again
and the ships sing the psalm of the immortal. A ka dua tuf ur biu
Bi a chefu dudu ner af an nuteru
Kha her nest af ur ar uatu an ba an khu an kha
Au aper ku khu am aper Children of technocracy invoke synthetic spirits
Plastic crosses choke perspiring necks
MAAT, I cast dices, but curtain of future is still hermetic closed
Rise! Rise up my Soror, and you, my Father,
High! Towards the stars when the white fire
Which purifies and melts all false sacrament Ashes power equal thousands suns
Mysterys structures are like chaos of known
Objectivism is subjective mandala of reality
Fractals, flaming spaces consume ego's order
Kaos Keraunos Kybernetos Lamipsos
Illumination in the face of thousand faces
Gnosis obtained by descending into the tunnels of self, knowing
When thunders of ecstasy strike black waves of unconscious sea

winnie da colorare From beyond all paths ov man I drew my rules
Infamous among gods and low I did fall
And the earth hath cried aloud
Hark! For enraged winds and storms now awaken
Now see me naked, yet draped in flames
My pent fury to unleash upon men Ov khaos I am, the disobediant one
Depraved son who hath dwellt in nothingness
Upon the ninth I fell, from grace up above
To taste this life ov sin, to give birth to the I I didst create demigods, strong in will and deed
That they may stand proud and call out thy names
How dare thou cross the paths ov mine
And leave my fallen sons behind
Oh, I shall feast in Gutter, as king ov nothing
I shall feed on thee, the Mightiest One
Behold! For I am Him!
Life giving flower that belongst to the dawn Hear.
Feel.
Pray.
Kneel. No holiness rules over my freedom
No commands from above I obey
I seek the ruin, I shake the worlds
Behold! I am blackest ov the black Ov khaos I am, the disobediant one
Depraved son who hath dwellt in nothingness
Upon the ninth I fell, from grace up above
To taste this life ov sin, to give birth to the I Welcome to Theatre of Absurd
When the world and rason are audience
And actor illusion and experience only Here gleams shiny mandala
In the chamber of creation and annihilation
And Lingam links with Yoni wisdom stone make There is neither space nor time
Books are read backwards or from all side
Everything Will sinks and tears down phantom of mourning Picture of universe in this simple formula,
Love is the Law
Proverb of juggler on the gate engraved
That life is delight
That death is also life FOOLS! I cast you all aside!
Your bullets harm me not
I am heresy, blazing hell
The embodiment ov all you fear
I am all which you can never be
A truth revealing hate machine
No longer will I tolerate
Lies from a kingdom built on dread
Yet what if naught exists above?
No shining glory and no god
You question not, blindly believe
Upon your ignorance I shall feast
Damn higher virtues, divine love
Your wooden idols and your law
Kneel before your god yet do not see
He doth feel you lies
Blinds you with fear
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
Your hearts I shall tear
With paws ov truth
With slashing jaws I rape
Your feeble womb
No god exists to save you from thy doom You will never see the light!
Bound to always live by lies! From the top of the highest mountain
Prior to descent, my fall for Thee
My weapon is silence, I, bringer of light
To burn this goddamn Eden down Behold I rise from primal silence
As a storm crushing dismal shores of Acheron
My weapon is violence from the mud of the earth
Back to the womb of Babylon Sink in the stream of woe
Acheron
Rise above the eyes of God
Necromanteion I am the oracle
I am the grace of god
I am the stream of woe
I am wrath from above From Neptunian realm arisen
Babylon the great I praised
With the voice of silence, I called the genii
Of the heights and depths I came down as raging Mars
As volcanic fire god
Totality and I are one
In the absence of light
Infinite I shall become Sink in the stream of woe
Acheron
Rise above the eyes of god
Necromanteion Sink in the stream of woe
Acheron
Rise above the eyes of god
Necromanteion Almighty asmodeus, existant of chaos
Ominous be thy name
Thy kingdom come on earth
Lead me into all temptation of my flesh
So I may trespass greatly into
Thy ways by my desires
For thou art all sex-seeking unity
Thou mighty genitalia of creation
That knoweth no satiation
Grant thou my wish
For thou art power, ecstasy and actuality amen! I am God, and all other gods are my imagery.
I gave birth to myself. I am millions of forms excreating;
eternal; and nothing exists except through me; yet
I am not them, they serve me.
Austin Osman Spare grant me profane kiss
oh Isis mother ov all
thy lips like morphine
teasing my slumbering heart
release me!
this cosmos is way to small
come down on earth, evangelize! ravishing muse
abduct my spirit
and bury my will
in spacious beyond
that human thought can never reach
alight upon the earth
and consecrate my engines ov life! and so I chant that triumph ov might
trampling kingdoms ov conscience
I, the archangel ov wrath
with one word, the unholy sword
I overmastered every image ov god I come in splendor and golden glory
seeking war trophies
and sacred spoils
to purify this heart ov mine
to cast away rotten rood
defile morality ov the blind god defiling morality ov black god Scream out against the glass
The sound reflected unable to escape
Desperate to connect
Lashing out at words that fail to appear Bound in silence
The failure of sound
Never learned Instinct urges on
As the mind creates its own obstacles
Waging internal war
Between the objects and the abstract Eloquence of the inner voice
The poetry of the condemned
A stream of consciousness
Never to be understood Above the high temple ov matter
Svastikas ov time slash the heaven
And from the pit, from the slime
From the thought
Gliphotic intruder decays
Lilith, Thantilaxath, Ziuaq
Non-manifestation born in the dark ov a day Can you hear distant desert call?
And stone you see, by Adytum builders
rejected, damned?
Deeper, deeper, in the night, world, fear
Towards the noctuary ov the truth From the mirror we crawls out
Devouring Eden's light
In the tunnels ov Seth he abides
Shugal, The Howler! Who am I? Where I'm going? Where?
We live dreaming
Slipping from body to body
And nightmares still our breath
And his in our souls
Poisoning with the venom ov existence Just say Illusion
When the first sunray falls
In your hawk eye
And don't look in the past
It hurts and there the Shadow lies in wait
So with every step on the oath
Beyond good and evil
Stronger GOD you became Avatars of powers from four worlds
Bathed me in jewels of belief
I drink the nectar of Goddess, my eternal mistress
I am Shiva, Hadit or Beast himself
And multitude of forms surpasses myself
I kneel before Isis, I, her god and slave
Coiled serpent lifts up his head and looks in my eyes
Third power and third eye create The One I am who I am not
I negate and confirm
I transgress, it is real! Wheels of change turn with my breath
I touch the red, hot firmament of golden darkenings of heavens
And stars are falling down onto every side of world
With my tongue I penetrate scarlet abysses of Kteis
Overflowing my body with thrill and heart with warmth
Suddenly I'm shooting forth venom
Cause I, I became a snake who rounds her flesh
Here and now, here and now Madness creeps through arteries of Grand Cosmic Body
Higher and lover, towards all directions
It violates old laws, repeals all orders
And seeks infinity in holy letters Child in crown its guide, Ever Coming Son
But it rambles suspended between emanations of Increasing and Descending
Thousand paths across thousand spheres
Mind is torn apart by Macrocosmic Snowflake
Death! Prismatic trees grow from mad rites
The knowledge of geometry elevated to the dignity of living substance
The Fool in the Universe knows nothing as usual
Transubstantiation of excrement and Styx waters is done! Carnal alchemy
Sephirotic transformation
In new body god incarnates Beyond duality, beyond understanding
Castrated man, bastard, secret chief is born
He builds the bridge of agreement,
spectre of his fall
And he is devoured by the fire of the Abyss O, ye whose future is in other hands!
Foul feeders! Slipped, are ye on you excrement?
Parasites! Having the world lousy,
Imagine ye are of significance to Heaven
I, who enjoy my body
I would rather pack with wolves
than enter your pest, houses Sensation. Nutrition. Mastication. Procreation!
This is your blind, worm cycle
Know ye of nothing further than your own stench?
Heaven is indifferent to your salvation or catastrophe The sword, trust, not salve, I bring! Honest was Sodom!
Your theology is a slime, pit of gibberish become ethics
In your world, where ignorance and deceit constitute felicity
Everything ends miserably,
besmirched with fratricidal blood. I am thine own begotten, Dionysus
Divine Mars, thou callst me son
And thou, Apollo, my begin gavest me
That dream hath my mind inflamed
And everyone a star hath become
My brothers and sisters in cosmic ectasy
Millions of sins and virtues were they
And all, the whole wealth of my life
That neither the end nor the beginning had
I could bestow Starspawn! Exploring our gracious flight, hiher,
We could make love to numberless stars,
With our tiny hand the world embrace
Learn it and forget it, be begotten and die
Forever exist, only mightier and absolute
Myself am Solaris
Universe and oneness
Nothingness and chaos am I
The last bow to thee, Earth, before
I ride a cosmic snake and devour the stars,
Before I become the beast
And no mortal man durst my magic defy
Planet Satan, receive the eternal possessor!
Me for myself I ascend thee
Me for the world I'm burning like a fucking fire
Mysterious Domain, Murdered Apprehension
Shemyaza, Lacifarus, glow like the Sun
in this final hour
ov Dawn ov the Dusk
I, heart ov all chthonic hearts
vulture eye, fallen one, proclaim: this great world
is a mirror ov my small self:
striving for infinity, shall I remain? we cannot kill the time:
it is the time that kills us
and I'm the answer on my questions
and blood ov my hopes and all prayers,
mark the sunset, the last judgement,
and my rainment.
this is the night, just black damn'd night as dethroned so enthroned, attracted. rejected.
in this totality is perfection ov Me in Thee
freedom ov Nature, delight ov Existence
so intoxicate me as I intoxicateth thee
slay me as I createth thee
when reality is nothing more
than quantum vortex

make it lucid dream
or hallucinate if you please

The last view inside my mind,
Silver walls ofg the castle
Risen proudly towards the sky
The rebellion failed.
Many brave ones went down,
Hung on black trees they are
Blown by the four winds
I've been waiting for years,
Growing stronger
Blazing weapons, eyes burn bright
In the dark, as a King I shall return.
Horns sing in the woods,
Hordes gather
Ancient gods of war
Ride on the sky
Old kingdom will fall
Like a moondust.
Reflecting down the walleys,
So pure, hungry for blood
The hearts of the dark ones
Thunders strike.
Dancing on the black mirrors,
The bards of war and venegeance
Came from forgotten realms
As a King I shell return.
To proclaim my victory,
Return of ancient pride,
Laws of steel.
Cold steel. my black face in the shadow
of the pentagram
among the silent forests
in the never existing town
my fingers touched the sky
I was god in forgotten times
jesus and his servants were
sucking my feet.lucifer, give me the power to rise now I'm fallen
a down of misery
among the blurs of evil
hidden in morality
I had power to destroy god
my demons ruled the crowd
now I can do nothing
alone in black crypt.satan, give me the power to rise but there will be days
when I shall rise
a dawn of my kingdom
slowly comes
I will fight again
will take your mind
to sit on the golden throne
somewhere in the sky.belial, give me the power to rise
oh. oh. satan, give me the power to rise.
