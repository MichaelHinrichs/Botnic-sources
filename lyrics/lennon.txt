that you,
would love me more than her If I trust in you oh please, don't run and hide

would be sad if our new love,
was in vain

when she learns we are two.

And I do appreciate you being round
Help me, get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me And now my life has changed in oh so many ways

Help me, get my feet back on the ground

Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright, very bright

Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl Well, you know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life tryin
Just to make you toe the line You'd better run for your life if you can, little girl

Na-na-naa
Na-na-naa
Na-na-naa
Na-na-naa I once had a girl
Or should I say she once had me
She showed me her room
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair I sat on the rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
It's time for bed She told me she worked
In the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good Norwegian wood? He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to Isn't he a bit like you and me? Nowhere man, please listen 
aaah-ah-la-la-la
You don't know what you're missing 
aaah-ah-la-la-la
Nowhere man 
aaah-ah-la-la-la
The world is at your command 
aaah-aah-lala-lala-la
He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere man, can you see me at all?

She's the kind of girl you want so much it makes you sorry
Still you don't regret a single day
Ah, girl
Shhhh
Girl, girl When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the earth to me and I believe her
After all this time I don't know why Ah, girl

Girl, girl She's the king of girl who puts you down 
Tit-tit-tit-tit tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tit

Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure? Will she still believe it when he's dead?
Ah, girl
Shhhh
Girl, girl

Ah, girl
Shhhh
Girl, girl Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream
It is not dying
It is not dying
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void It is shining
It is shining
That you may see the meaning of within
It is being It is being
That love is all, that love is everyone
It is knowing
It is knowing That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing
It is believing
But listen to the colour of your dream It is not living
It is not living
All play the game, existence to the end

And your bird can sing
But you don't get me

You'll say you've seen seven wonders
And your bird is green
But you can't see me You can't see
Me
When your prized possessions
Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction I'll be round
I'll be round When your bird is broken
Will it bring you down? You may be awoken
I'll be round
I'll be round
You tell me that you heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you can't hear me
You can't hear
Me When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream 
float up stream
Please don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need 
there's no need
Please don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling
Please don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream 
float up stream
Please don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping She said,
I know what it's like to be dead.
I know what it is to be sad.
And she's making me feel like
I've never been born. I said,
Who put all those things in your head?
Things that make me feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like
I've never been born. She said, You don't understand what I've said.
I said, No, no, no. You're wrong.
When I was a boy,
Everything was right.
Everything was right. I said,
Even though you know what you know,
I know that I'm ready to leave
Because you're making me feel like
I've never been born. She said, You don't understand what I've said.
I said, No, no, no. You're wrong.
When I was a boy,

Good morning, ah
Going to work don't want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing Everything is closed it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own you're in the street
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing is changed it's still the same I've got nothing to say but it's OK
Good morning
Good morning
Good morning, ah 
People running round it's five o clock
Everywhere in town is getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life It's time for tea and meet the wife
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear
Go to a show you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say but it's OK

And you're gone Lucy in the sky with diamonds

Shaves in the dark
Trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops
She's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Well you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes the News of the World

Aah-a-a-a-ah-aaaaah Words are flowing out
Like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass
They slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my open mind
Possessing and caressing me Jai Guru Deva, om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Images of broken light
Which dance before me like a million eyes They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind
Inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai Guru Deva, om
Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Sounds of laughter shades of earth
Are ringing through my open views
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love
Which shines around me like a million suns It calls me on and on across the universe
Jai Guru Deva, om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Jai Guru Deva Jai Guru Deva

Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said
You've got to go back
You know, they didn't even give us a chance
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna to crucify me
Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say
You can make it okay
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna to crucify me
So from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The news people said
Say, what you doing in bed?
I said, We're only trying to get us some peace
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna to crucify me
Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said
Oh boy, when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you but your soul
Think!
Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
Newspapers said
She's gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna to crucify me
Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press
Said, We wish you success
It's good to have the both of you back
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna to crucify me
The way things are going
They're gonna to crucify me
