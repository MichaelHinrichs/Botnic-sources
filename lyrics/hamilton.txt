How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten
Spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?


The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter


And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter


Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain


Well, the word got around, they said, "This kid is insane, man"
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
"Get your education, don't forget from whence you came, and
The world's gonna know your name. What's your name, man?"


Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait


When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin in their own sick, the scent thick


And Alex got better but his mother went quick


Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying
"Alex, you gotta fend for yourself."
He started retreatin and readin every treatise on the shelf


There would have been nothin left to do
For someone less astute
He woulda been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin for his late mother's landlord
Tradin sugar cane and rum and all the things he can't afford
Scammin for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin for the future see him now as he stands on ooh
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man


In New York you can be a new man Just you wait
In New York you can be a new man Just you wait
In New York you can be a new man
In New York, New York
Just you wait!


Alexander Hamilton Alexander Hamilton
We are waiting in the wings for you waiting in the wings for you
You could never back down
You never learned to take your time!
Oh, Alexander Hamilton Alexander Hamilton
When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh


The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him
Just you wait
Another immigrant
Comin up from the bottom
Just you wait
His enemies destroyed his rep
America forgot him


We fought with him


Me? I died for him


Me? I trusted him


Me? I loved him


And me? I'm the damn fool that shot him


There's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait!


What's your name, man?


Alexander Hamilton!



I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm a get a scholarship to King's College
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Ev'ry burden, every disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the


ALEXANDER

we are meant to be
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!


He says in parentheses


Don't be shocked when your hist'ry book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy


And I am not throwing away
My shot my shot
I am not throwing away
My shot my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
And I'm not throwing away my shot


I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!


I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to onarchy?
Onarchy? How you say, how you say, anarchy?'
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my


Shot!


Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion cuz I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin some pants!
I'm gonna take a


Shot!


But we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
You and I. Do or die. Wait till I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another


Shot!


Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!


Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin the pot
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!

Oh, am I talkin too loud?
Sometimes I get over excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud


Let's get this guy in front of a crowd


I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot


Everybody sing:
Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa, whoa, whoa
Hey!
Whoa Whoa
Wooh!!
Whoa! Whoa
Said let em hear ya! Yea
Let's go!


Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
I said shout it to the rooftops!
Whoa!
Said, to the rooftops!
Whoa!
Come on!
Yea
Come on, let's go!


Rise up!
When you're living on your knees, you rise up
Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up


When are these colonies gonna rise up?
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
Whoa
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
Whoa
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
Whoa
Rise up! Rise up!


I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty

Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with
Something to prove went?
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
Is that a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin n fightin'
I've been readin n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'
I'm passionately smashin every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin past tomorrow


And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot


We're gonna rise up! Time to take a shot!
Not throwing away my shot
We're gonna rise up! Time to take a shot!
Not throwing away my shot
We're gonna
We're gonna


Time to take a shot! Rise up



Time to take a shot! Rise up
Time to take a shot! Rise up
Take a shot! Ri ri ri
Shot!
Shot!
A-yo it's
Time to take a shot! Time to take a shot!
Time to take a shot! Time to take a shot!
And I am And I am


Not throwin away my


Not throwin away my shot!



1776. New York City


Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?


That depends. Who's asking?


Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you


I'm getting nervous


Sir
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?


You punched the bursar


Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid

So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?


It was my parents dying wish before they passed


You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for


Can I buy you a drink?


That would be nice


While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less


What?


Smile more


Ha


Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for


You can't be serious


You wanna get ahead?


Yes


Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead


Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?


Show time!


Like I said


Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
Two pints o Sam Adams, but I'm workin on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
Cuz I will pop chick-a pop these cops till I'm free!


Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!


Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin it, yes I heard ya mother said "Come again?"


Ayyyyy


Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets


Wow


No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more


To the revolution!


Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!


Aaron Burr!


Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!


Good luck with that: you're takin a stand
You spit. I'm a sit. We'll see where we land


Boooo!


Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?


If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?


Ooh
Who you?
Who you?
Who are you?


Ooh, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?



Ladies and gentlemen, you coulda been anywhere in the world tonight, but you're here with us in New York City. Are you ready for a cabinet meeting???

The issue on the table: Secretary Hamilton's plan to assume state debt and establish a national bank. Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir


Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
We fought for these ideals, we shouldn't settle for less
These are wise words, enterprising men quote em
Don't act surprised, you guys, cuz I wrote em


Oww


But Hamilton forgets
His plan would have the government assume state's debts
Now, place your bets as to who that benefits:
The very seat of government where Hamilton sits


Not true!


Ooh, if the shoe fits, wear it
If New York's in debt
Why should Virginia bear it? Uh! Our debts are paid, I'm afraid
Don't tax the South cuz we got it made in the shade
In Virginia, we plant seeds in the ground
We create. You just wanna move our money around
This financial plan is an outrageous demand
And it's too many damn pages for any man to understand
Stand with me in the land of the free
And pray to God we never see Hamilton's candidacy
Look, when Britain taxed our tea, we got frisky
Imagine what gon happen when you try to tax our whisky


Thank you, Secretary Jefferson
That's my alcohol!
Secretary Hamilton, your response


Thomas. That was a real nice declaration
Welcome to the present, we're running a real nation
Would you like to join us, or stay mellow
Doin whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello?
If we assume the debts, the union gets
A new line of credit, a financial diuretic
How do you not get it? If we're aggressive and competitive
The union gets a boost. You'd rather give it a sedative?
A civics lesson from a slaver. Hey neighbor
Your debts are paid cuz you don't pay for labor
"We plant seeds in the South. We create."
Yeah, keep ranting
We know who's really doing the planting
And another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment
Don't lecture me about the war, you didn't fight in it
You think I'm frightened of you, man?
We almost died in the trench
While you were off getting high with the French
Thomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the President
Reticentthere isn't a plan he doesn't jettison
Madison, you're mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine
Damn, you're in worse shape than the national debt is in
Sittin there useless as two shits
Hey, turn around, bend over, I'll show you
Where my shoe fits


Excuse me? Madison, Jefferson, take a walk! Hamilton, take a walk! We'll reconvene after a brief recess. Hamilton!


Sir!


A word


You don't have the votes


You don't have the votes


Aha-ha-ha ha!


You're gonna need congressional approval and you don't have the votes


Such a blunder sometimes it makes me wonder why I even bring the thunder


Why he even brings the thunder


You wanna pull yourself together?


I'm sorry, these Virginians are birds of a feather


Young man, I'm from Virginia, so watch your mouth


So we let Congress get held hostage by the South?


You need the votes


No, we need bold strokes. We need this plan


No, you need to convince more folks


James Madison won't talk to me, that's a nonstarter


Winning was easy, young man. Governing's harder


They're being intransigent


You have to find a compromise


But they don't have a plan, they just hate mine!


Convince them otherwise


What happens if I don't get congressional approval?


I imagine they'll call for your removal


Sir


Figure it out, Alexander. That's an order from your commander



After the war I went back to New York


A-After the war I went back to New York


I finished up my studies and I practiced law


I practiced law, Burr worked next door


Even though we started at the very same time
Alexander Hamilton began to climb
How to account for his rise to the top?
Maaaaan, the man is


Non-stop!


Gentlemen of the jury, I'm curious, bear with me
Are you aware that we're making hist'ry?
This is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation
The liberty behind
Deliberation


Non-stop!


I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
With my assistant counsel


Co-counsel
Hamilton, sit down
Our client Levi Weeks is innocent. Call your first witness
That's all you had to say!


Okay!
One more thing


Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom!


Awwww!


Why do you write like you're running out of time?
Write day and night like you're running out of time?
Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time
Keep on fighting. In the meantime


Non-stop!


Corruption's such an old song that we can sing along in harmony
And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany
This colony's economy's increasingly stalling and


Honestly, that's why public service
Seems to be calling me
He's just non-stop!


I practiced the law, I practic'ly perfected it
I've seen injustice in the world and I've corrected it
Now for a strong central democracy
If not, then I'll be Socrates
Throwing verbal rocks at these mediocrities


Awww!


Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention:


I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention!


There as a New York junior delegate:


Now what I'm going to say may sound indelicate Awwww


Goes and proposes his own form of government! What?
His own plan for a new form of government! What?


Talks for six hours! The convention is listless!


Bright young man


Yo, who the f is this?


Why do you always say what you believe?
Why do you always say what you believe?
Ev'ry proclamation guarantees free ammunition for your enemies!


Awww!


Why do you write like it's
Going out of style?
Write day and night like it's
Going out of style?


Ev'ry day you fight like it's
Going out of style
Do what you do


Alexander?


Aaron Burr, sir


It's the middle of the night


Can we confer, sir?


Is this a legal matter?


Yes, and it's important to me


What do you need?


Burr, you're a better lawyer than me


Okay


I know I talk too much, I'm abrasive
You're incredible in court. You're succinct, persuasive
My client needs a strong defense. You're the solution


Who's your client?


The new U.S. Constitution?


No


Hear me out


No way!


A series of essays, anonymously published
Defending the document to the public


No one will read it


I disagree


And if it fails?


Burr, that's why we need it


The constitution's a mess


So it needs amendments


It's full of contradictions


So is independence
We have to start somewhere


No. No way


You're making a mistake


Good night


Hey
What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for?


What?


We won the war
What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?


Of course


Then defend it


And what if you're backing the wrong horse?


Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
For the notion of a nation we now get to build
For once in your life, take a stand with pride
I don't understand how you stand to the side


I'll keep all my plans close to my chest
Wait for it, wait for it, wait
I'll wait here and see which way the wind will blow
I'm taking my time watching the afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow


I am sailing off to London
I'm accompanied by someone who always pays
I have found a wealthy husband
Who will keep me in comfort for all my days
He is not a lot of fun, but there's no one
Who can match you for turn of phrase
My Alexander


Angelica


Don't forget to write


Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if your wife could share a fraction of your time
If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?


Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one!


How do you write like you're running out of time?
Write day and night like you're running out of time?


Ev'ry day you fight like you're running out of time
Like you're running out of time
Are you running out of time?
Awwww!


How do you write like tomorrow won't arrive?
How do you write like you need it to survive?
How do you write every second you're alive?
Ev'ry second you're alive? Ev'ry second you're alive?


They are asking me to lead
I am doing the best I can
To get the people that I need
I'm asking you to be my right hand man


Treasury or State?


I know it's a lot to ask


Treasury or State?


To leave behind the world you know


Sir, do you want me to run the Treasury or State department?


Treasury


Let's go


Alexander


I have to leave


Alexander


Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now


Helpless


They are asking me to lead


Look around, isn't this enough?


He will never be satisfied
What would be enough?
He will never be satisfied to be satisfied
Satisfied, satisfied


History has its eyes
Look around, look around!
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
On you
Isn't this enough?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room? Non-stop
What would be enough?


He will never be satisfied
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room? Non-stop
Satisfied, satisfied


History has its eyes
Soon that attitude's gonna be your doom! Non-stop
On you
Why do you fight like you're running out of time? Non-stop


Why do you fight like


History has its eyes on you


I am not throwin away my shot! Just you wait!


I am not throwin away my shot! Just you wait!


I am Alexander Hamilton!


Hamilton, just you wait!


I am not throwin away my shot!



The battle of Yorktown. 1781


Monsieur Hamilton


Monsieur Lafayette


In command where you belong


How you say, no sweat
We're finally on the field. We've had quite a run


Immigrants:


We get the job done


So what happens if we win?


I go back to France
I bring freedom to my people if I'm given the chance


We'll be with you when you do


Go lead your men


See you on the other side


Til we meet again, let's go!


I am not throwin away my shot!
I am not throwin away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwin away my shot!
I am not throwin away my shot!


Til the world turns upside down


Til the world turns upside down!


I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
This is where it gets me: on my feet
The enemy ahead of me
If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me
Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me
Then I remember my Eliza's expecting me
Not only that, my Eliza's expecting
We gotta go, gotta get the job done
Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!
Take the bullets out your gun!


What?


The bullets out your gun!


What?


We move under cover and we move as one
Through the night, we have one shot to live another day
We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it
It's either that or meet the business end of a bayonet
The code word is Rochambeau, dig me?


Rochambeau!


You have your orders now, go, man, go!
And so the American experiment begins
With my friends all scattered to the winds
Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav'ry


We'll never be free until we end slavery!


When we finally drive the British away
Lafayette is there waiting


In Chesapeake Bay!


How did we know that this plan would work?
We had a spy on the inside. That's right


Hercules Mulligan!


A tailor spyin on the British government!
I take their measurements, information and then I smuggle it


Up


To my brother's revolutionary covenant
I'm runnin with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin it!
See, that's what happens when you up against the ruffians
We in the shit now, somebody gotta shovel it!
Hercules Mulligan, I need no introduction
When you knock me down I get the fuck back up again!


Left! Right! Hold!
Go!
What! What! What!


After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet


We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief


And just like that, it's over. We tend to our wounded, we count our dead


Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom


Not. Yet


We negotiate the terms of surrender
I see George Washington smile
We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing
And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song they're singing


The world turned upside down


The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
Down
Down, down, down


Freedom for America, freedom for France!


Down, down, down


Gotta start a new nation
Gotta meet my son


Down, down, down


We won!


We won!


We won!


We won!


The world turned upside down!



One two three four five six seven eight nine!


My dearest, Angelica
"Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day"
I trust you'll understand the reference to
Another Scottish tragedy without my having to name the play
They think me Macbeth, and ambition is my folly
I'm a polymath, a pain in the ass, a massive pain
Madison is Banquo, Jefferson's Macduff
And Birnam Wood is Congress on its way to Dunsinane


And there you are, an ocean away
Do you have to live an ocean away?
Thoughts of you subside
Then I get another letter
I cannot put the notion away


Take a break


I am on my way


There's a little surprise before supper
And it cannot wait


I'll be there in just a minute, save my plate


Alexander


Okay, okay


Your son is nine years old today
And he has something that he'd like to say
He's been practicing all day
Philip, take it away


Daddy, daddy, look
My name is Philip
I am a poet
I wrote this poem just
To show it
And I just turned nine
You can write rhymes
But you can't write mine
What!
I practice French
And play piano with my mother Uh-huh!
I have a sister
But I want a little brother Okay!
My daddy's trying to start America's bank
Un deux trois quatre cinq! Bravo!


Take a break


Hey, our kid is pretty great


Run away with us for the summer
Let's go upstate


Eliza, I've got so much on my plate


We can all go stay with my father
There's a lake I know


I know


In a nearby park


I'd love to go


You and I can go when the night gets dark


I will try to get away


My dearest Alexander
You must get through to Jefferson
Sit down with him and compromise
Don't stop til you agree
Your fav'rite older sister
Angelica, reminds you
There's someone in your corner all the way across the sea

In a letter I received from you two weeks ago
I noticed a comma in the middle of a phrase
It changed the meaning. Did you intend this?
One stroke and you've consumed my waking days
It says:


"My dearest Angelica"


With a comma after "dearest." You've written


"My dearest, Angelica."


Anyway, all this to say
I'm coming home this summer
At my sister's invitation
I'll be there with your fam'ly
If you make your way upstate
I know you're very busy
I know your work's important
But I'm crossing the ocean and I just can't wait


You won't be an ocean away
You will only be a moment away


Alexander, come downstairs. Angelica's arriving today!


Angelica!


Eliza!


The Schuyler sisters!


Alexander


Hi


It's good to see your face


Angelica, tell this man John Adams spends the summer with his family


Angelica, tell my wife John Adams doesn't have a real job anyway


you're not joining us? Wait


I'm afraid I cannot join you upstate


Alexander, I came all this way


She came all this way


All this way


Take a break


You know I have to get my plan through Congress


Run away with us for the summer
Let's go upstate


I lose my job if we don't get this plan through Congress


We can all go stay with our father


There's a lake I know
I know I'll miss your face
In a nearby park
Screw your courage to the sticking place
You and I can go
Eliza's right
Take a break and get away Take a break
Run away with us for the summer
Let's go upstate Let's go upstate
Where we can stay
We can all go stay with our father
If you take your time
Look around, look around
At how lucky we are to be alive right now You will make your mark
Close your eyes and dream
We can go
When the night gets dark When the night gets dark
Take a break Take a break


I have to get my plan through Congress
I can't stop until I get this plan through Congress



There's nothing like summer in the city
Someone under stress meets someone looking pretty
There's trouble in the air, you can smell it
And Alexander's by himself. I'll let him tell it


I hadn't slept in a week
I was weak, I was awake
You never seen a bastard orphan
More in need of a break
Longing for Angelica
Missing my wife
That's when Miss Maria Reynolds walked into my life, she said:


I know you are a man of honor
I'm so sorry to bother you at home
But I don't know where to go, and I came here all alone


She said:


My husband's doin me wrong
Beatin me, cheatin me, mistreatin me
Suddenly he's up and gone
I don't have the means to go on


So I offered her a loan, I offered to walk her home, she said


You're too kind, sir


I gave her thirty bucks that I had socked away
She lived a block away, she said:


This one's mine, sir


Then I said, "well, I should head back home,"
She turned red, she led me to her bed
Let her legs spread and said:


Stay?


Hey


Hey


That's when I began to pray:
Lord, show me how to
Say no to this
I don't know how to
Say no to this

But my God, she looks so helpless
And her body's saying, "hell, yes"


Whoa


Nooo, show me how to


Say no to this


I don't know how to


Say no to this


In my mind, I'm tryin to go


Go! Go! Go!


Then her mouth is on mine, and I don't say


No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!


I wish I could say that was the last time
I said that last time. It became a pastime
A month into this endeavor I received a letter
From a Mr. James Reynolds, even better, it said:


Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me: down on their luck
You see, that was my wife who you decided to


Fuuuu


Uh-oh! You made the wrong sucker a cuckold
So time to pay the piper for the pants you unbuckled
And hey, you can keep seein my whore wife
If the price is right: if not I'm telling your wife


I hid the letter and I raced to her place
Screamed "How could you?!" in her face
She said:


No, sir!


Half dressed, apologetic. A mess, she looked
Pathetic, she cried:


Please don't go, sir!


So was your whole story a setup?


I don't know about any letter!


Stop crying
Goddamnit, get up!


I didn't know any better


I am ruined


Please don't leave me with him helpless I am helplesshow could I do this?
Just give him what he wants and you can have me
I don't want you
Whatever you want I don't want you


If you pay I don't
You can stay
Lord, show me how to
Say no to this Say no to this!
Tonight I don't know how to
Say no to this!
Say no to this
Cause the situation's helpless Helpless
And her body's screaming, "Hell, yes" Whoa!
How can you No, show me how to
Say no to this!
Say no to this? Say no to this
Say no to this!
How can I say no to this?
There is nowhere I can go Go! Go! Go!
When her body's on mine I do not say No!


Yes Yes!
Say no to this!
No!
Yes Yes!
Say no to this!
No!
Yes Yes!
Say no to this!
No!
Yes Yes!
Say no to this!
Say no to this
I don't say no to this Don't say no to this
There is nowhere I can go.
Go go go


So?


Nobody needs to know



There are moments that the words don't reach
There is suffering too terrible to name
You hold your child as tight as you can
And push away the unimaginable
The moments when you're in so deep
It feels easier to just swim down


The Hamiltons move uptown
And learn to live with the unimaginable


I spend hours in the garden
I walk alone to the store
And it's quiet uptown
I never liked the quiet before
I take the children to church on Sunday
A sign of the cross at the door
And I pray
That never used to happen before


If you see him in the street, walking by
Himself, talking to himself, have pity


Philip, you would like it uptown
It's quiet uptown


He is working through the unimaginable


His hair has gone grey. He passes every day
They say he walks the length of the city


You knock me out, I fall apart


Can you imagine?


Look at where we are
Look at where we started
I know I don't deserve you, Eliza
But hear me out. That would be enough

If I could spare his life
If I could trade his life for mine
He'd be standing here right now
And you would smile, and that would be enough
I don't pretend to know
The challenges we're facing
I know there's no replacing what we've lost
And you need time
But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
Just let me stay here by your side
That would be enough


If you see him in the street, walking by her
Side, talking by her side, have pity


Eliza, do you like it uptown? It's quiet uptown


He is trying to do the unimaginable
See them walking in the park, long after dark
Taking in the sights of the city


Look around, look around, Eliza


They are trying to do the unimaginable


There are moments that the words don't reach
There is a grace too powerful to name
We push away what we can never understand
We push away the unimaginable
They are standing in the garden
Alexander by Eliza's side
She takes his hand


It's quiet uptown


Forgiveness. Can you imagine?
Forgiveness. Can you imagine?
If you see him in the street, walking by her
Side, talking by her side, have pity
They are going through the unimaginable



The issue on the table: France is on the verge of war with England
And do we provide aid and our troops to our French allies or do we stay out of it?
Remember, my decision on this matter is not subject to congressional approval
The only person you have to convince is me
Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir


When we were on death's door, when we were needy
We made a promise, we signed a treaty
We needed money and guns and half a chance
Who provided those funds?


France


In return, they didn't ask for land
Only a promise that we'd lend a hand
And stand with them if they fought against oppressors
And revolution is messy but now is the time to stand
Stand with our brothers as they fight against tyranny
I know that Alexander Hamilton is here and he
Would rather not have this debate
I'll remind you that he is not Secretary of State
He knows nothing of loyalty
Smells like new money, dresses like fake royalty
Desperate to rise above his station
Everything he does betrays the ideals of our nation


Ooh!!


Hey, and if ya don't know, now ya know, Mr. President


Thank you, Secretary Jefferson. Secretary Hamilton, your response


You must be out of your Goddamn mind if you think
The President is gonna bring the nation to the brink
Of meddling in the middle of a military mess
A game of chess, where France is Queen and Kingless
We signed a treaty with a King whose head is now in a basket
Would you like to take it out and ask it?
"Should we honor our treaty, King Louis head?"
"Uh do whatever you want, I'm super dead."


Enough. Hamilton is right


Mr. President


We're too fragile to start another fight


But sir, do we not fight for freedom?


Sure, when the French figure out who's gonna lead em


The people are leading


The people are rioting
There's a difference. Frankly, it's a little disquieting you would let your ideals blind you to reality
Hamilton


Sir


Draft a statement of neutrality


Did you forget Lafayette?


What?


Have you an ounce of regret?
You accumulate debt, you accumulate power
Yet in their hour of need, you forget


Lafayette's a smart man, he'll be fine
And before he was your friend, he was mine
If we try to fight in every revolution in the world, we never stop
Where do we draw the line?


So quick-witted


Alas, I admit it


I bet you were quite a lawyer


My defendants got acquitted


Yeah. Well, someone oughta remind you


What?


You're nothing without Washington behind you


Hamilton!


Daddy's calling!



I may not live to see our glory!


I may not live to see our glory!


But I will gladly join the fight!


But I will gladly join the fight!


And when our children tell our story


And when our children tell our story


They'll tell the story of tonight


Let's have another round tonight


Let's have another round tonight


Let's have another round tonight


Raise a glass to freedom
Something they can never take away
No matter what they tell you
Raise a glass to the four of us


Tomorrow there'll be more of us


Telling the story of tonight


They'll tell the story of tonight


Raise a glass to freedom
Something they can never take away


No matter what they tell you


Let's have another round tonight


Raise a glass to the four of us


Tomorrow there'll be more of us


Telling the story of tonight


Let's have another round tonight


They'll tell the story of tonight
Raise a glass to freedom
They'll tell the story of tonight
Raise a glass to freedom
They'll tell the story of tonight
They'll tell the story of


Tonight

Lana: That's the formal style in which letters were written at the time. Regardless of your personal feelings towards the other party, a gentleman retains the polite styles, and the polite style dictates that you conclude your letter with the farewell signature "I have the honor to be your obedient servant, " It was so common and well known that they would often abbreviate the last words, like "yr. obdt. svt" because everybody knew what you meant.

It's being used here in a heavily ironic way: obviously they have no respect for each other any more and hate each other's guts, so they're being utterly, coldly, icily polite to each other, taking refuge in formal rules of social conduct Like the duel itself.



The Reynolds Pamphlet


Have you read this?


Alexander Hamilton had a torrid affair
And he wrote it down right there


Highlights!


"The charge against me
Is a connection with one
James Reynolds! James Reynolds!
For purposes of
Improper speculation
My real crime is an My real crime is an
Amorous connection with his wife Amorous connection with his wife
For a considerable time
With his knowing consent


Damn!


"I had frequent meetings with her
Most of them at my own house."


At his own house!


At his own house!


Damn!


"Mrs. Hamilton with our children being absent
On a visit to her father."


No


Boooo!


Have you read this?


Well, he's never gon be President now

That's one less thing to worry about

Angelica


All the way from London?!
Damn


Angelica, thank God
Someone who understands what I'm
Struggling here to do


I'm not here for you


Oooooh!


I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
I love my sister more than anything in this life
I will choose her happiness over mine every time
Put what we had aside
I'm standing at her side
You could never be satisfied
God, I hope you're satisfied

The Reynolds Pamphlet


Have you read this?
You ever see somebody ruin their own life?


His poor wife



I may not live to see our glory!


I may not live to see our glory!


But I've seen wonders great and small


I've seen wonders great and small


Cause if the tomcat can get married


If Alexander can get married


There's hope for our ass, after all!


Raise a glass to freedom


Hey!
Something you will never see again!


No matter what she tells you


Let's have another round tonight!


Raise a glass to the four of us!


Ho!


To the newly not poor of us!


Woo!


We'll tell the story of tonight


Let's have another round


Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr


Sir!


I didn't think that you would make it


To be sure


Burr!


I came to say congratulations


Spit a verse, Burr!


I see the whole gang is here


You are the worst, Burr!


Ignore them. Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal


No, you don't


Yes, I do


Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable


Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on the side, Burr


Is that so?


What are you tryin to hide, Burr?


I should go


No, these guys should go


What?


No!


Leave us alone


Man


It's alright, Burr. I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr


You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir


What do you mean?


She's married


I see


She's married to a British officer


Oh shit


Congrats again, Alexander. Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war


I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her! What are you waiting for?


I'll see you on the other side of the war


I'll see you on the other side of the war



In the eye of a hurricane
There is quiet
For just a moment
A yellow sky

When I was seventeen a hurricane
Destroyed my town
I didn't drown
I couldn't seem to die

I wrote my way out
Wrote everything down far as I could see
I wrote my way out
I looked up and the town had its eyes on me

They passed a plate around
Total strangers
Moved to kindness by my story
Raised enough for me to book passage on a
Ship that was New York bound

I wrote my way out of hell
I wrote my way to revolution
I was louder than the crack in the bell
I wrote Eliza love letters until she fell
I wrote about The Constitution and defended it well
And in the face of ignorance and resistance
I wrote financial systems into existence
And when my prayers to God were met with indifference
I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance

In the eye of a hurricane
There is quiet
For just a moment
A yellow sky

I was twelve when my mother died
She was holding me
We were sick and she was holding me
I couldn't seem to die


Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it


I'll write my way out


Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it


Write everything down, far as I can see


Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait
History has its eyes on you


I'll write my way out
Overwhelm them with honesty
This is the eye of the hurricane, this is the only
Way I can protect my legacy


Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait


The Reynolds Pamphlet



Lee, do you yield?


You shot him in the side!
Yes, he yields!


I'm satisfied


Yo, we gotta clear the field!


Go! We won


Here comes the General!


This should be fun


What is the meaning of this? Mr. Burr, get a medic for the General


Yes, sir


Lee, you will never agree with me
But believe me, these young men don't speak for me
Thank you for your service


Let's ride!


Hamilton!


Sir!


Meet me inside


Meet him inside! Meet him inside!
Meet him inside, meet him, meet him inside!


Son


Don't call me son


This war is hard enough
Without infighting


Lee called you out. We called his bluff


You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south


You're absolutely right, John should have shot him in the mouth
That would've shut him up


Son


I'm notcha son


Watch your tone
I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown


Charles Lee, Thomas Conway
These men take your name and they rake it
Through the mud


My name's been through a lot, I can take it


Well, I don't have your name. I don't have your titles
I don't have your land
But, if you


No


If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, I could fly above my station after the war


Or you could die and we need you alive


I'm more than willing to die


Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive


Call me son one more time


Go home, Alexander
That's an order from your commander


Sir


Go home



How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross flag higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love who's unafraid to step in!
He's constantly confusin', confoundin the British henchmen
Ev'ryone give it up for America's favorite fighting Frenchman!


Lafayette!


I'm takin this horse by the reins makin'
Redcoats redder with bloodstains


Lafayette!


And I'm never gonna stop until I make em
Drop and burn em up and scatter their remains, I'm


Lafayette!


Watch me engagin em! Escapin em!
Enragin em! I'm


Lafayette!


I go to France for more funds


Lafayette!


I come back with more


Guns
And ships
And so the balance shifts


We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts


We can end this war at Yorktown, cut them off at sea, but
For this to succeed, there is someone else we need:


I know


Hamilton!


Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, I mean


Hamilton!


Sir, you're gonna have to use him eventually
What's he gonna do on the bench? I mean


Hamilton!


No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance


Hamilton!


You wanna fight for your land back? Hamilton!


I need my right hand man back! Hamilton!


Ah! Uh, get ya right hand man back
Get your right hand man back!
Hamilton!
You know you gotta get ya right hand man back
Your right hand man back!
Hamilton!
I mean you gotta put some thought into the letter
HahaHamilton
But the sooner the better to get your right hand man back!
Hamilton, haha


Alexander Hamilton
Troops are waiting in the field for you
If you join us right now, together we can turn the tide
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
I have soldiers that will yield for you
If we manage to get this right
They'll surrender by early light
The world will never be the same, Alexander



Oh my God. Tear this dude apart


Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me


Let him be


They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame


Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the sound of screams
But the Revolution is comin'
The have-nots are gonna win this
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face
Heed not the rabble who scream Revolution
They have not your interests at heart
Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us, honestly you shouldn't even talk
And what about Boston? Look at the cost
N all that we've lost n you talk about Congress?!
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me
My dog speaks more eloquently than thee
They're playing a dangerous game
But strangely, your mange is the same
I pray the king shows you his mercy
Is he in Jersey?
For shame
For the Revolution
For shame!


For the revolution!


Heed


If you repeat yourself again I'm gonna


Scream


Honestly, look at me, please don't read!


Not your interests


Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?


Alexander, please!


Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties


Silence! A message from the King!
A message from the King!


A message from the King!


One, two, three, four


Five, six, seven, eight, nine…


It's the Ten Duel Commandments


It's the Ten Duel Commandments
Number one!


The challenge: demand satisfaction
If they apologize, no need for further action


Number two!


If they don't, grab a friend, that's your second


Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned


Number three!


Have your seconds meet face to face


Negotiate a peace…


Or negotiate a time and place


This is commonplace, specially tween recruits


Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Number four!


If they don't reach a peace, that's alright
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site


You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility


You have him turn around so he can have deniability


Five!


Duel before the sun is in the sky


Pick a place to die where it's high and dry
Number six!


Leave a note for your next of kin
Tell em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in


Seven!


Confess your sins. Ready for the moment
Of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent


Number eight!


Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight…


Alexander


Aaron Burr, sir


Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?


Sure
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr


With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir


Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?


Okay, so we're doin this


Number nine!


Look em in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count


One two three four


Five six seven eight nine


Number


Ten paces!


Fire!
