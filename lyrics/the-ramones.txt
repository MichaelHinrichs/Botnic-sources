Kiss me I just gotta

Tell me that you feel
Tell me that you feel the same Baby, I love you
Come on baby
baby, I love you
Baby I love, I love only you Under the arc of a weather stain boards
Ancient goblins, and warlords
Come out of the ground, not making a sound
The smell of death is all around And the night when the cold wind blows
No one cares, nobody knows. I don't want to be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again
I don't want to be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again Follow Victor to the sacred place
This ain't a dream, I can't escape
Molars and fangs, the clicking of bones
Spirits moaning among the tombstones And the night, when the moon is bright
Someone cries, something ain't right I don't want to be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again
I don't want to be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again, oh The moon is full, the air is still
All of a sudden I feel a chill
Victor is grinning, flesh rotting away
Skeletons dance, I curse this day And the night when the wolves cry out
Listen close and you can hear me shout I don't want to be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again
I don't want to be buried in a pet sematary
I don't want to live my life again I don't want to live my life not again
I don't want to live my life not again Hey ho, let's go

All the girls are in love with me
I'm a teenage lobotomy, yeah Hey I used to be on an endless run
Believed in miracles 'cuz I'm one
I've been blessed with the power to survive
After all these years I'm still alive
I'm out here kickin' with the band
I am no longer a solitary man
Everyday my time runs out
Live like a fool, that's what I was about Oh I believe in miracles
Oh I believe in a better world, for me and you
Oh oh I believe in miracles
Oh oh I believe in a better world, for me and you Tattooed your name on my arm
I always said, "My girl's a good luck charm"
If she can find a reason to forgive
Then I can find a reason to live
I used to be on an endless run
Believed in miracles 'cuz I'm one
I've been blessed with the power to survive
After all these years I'm still alive Oh I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world, for me and you
Oh oh I believe in miracles
Oh oh I believe in a better world, for me and you I close my eyes and think
How it might be?
The future's here today
It's not too late, it's not too late
I believe in miracles
Oh I believe in a better world, for me and you
Oh I believe in miracles
I believe in a better world for me and you
All right I hear the bells of freedom chimin'
And inside my heart I feel I'm dyin'
Wise guys never compromise
Then they loose their rights and they act surprised
Jail really cuts ya down to size Let the punishment fit the crime
The footprints on the sand of time
The philosophy of the poet's rhyme
Makes a man humble in his prime You can go up, down, or sideways
Be on death row, counting the days
They say the answers are blowin' in the wind
And to take yourself out would really be a sin
You just have to cope and start over again Let the punishment fit the crime
The footprints on the sand of time
The philosophy of the poet's rhyme
Makes a man humble in his prime Little child cries in his sleep
And life makes promises it can't keep
And then feel you had, had enough.
You realize somehow, someway
Your destiny was planned from the very first day Let the punishment fit the crime
The footprints on the sand of time
The philosophy of the poet's rhyme
Makes a man humble in his prime Let the punishment fit the crime
The footprints on the sand of time
The philosophy of the poet's rhyme
Makes a man humble in his prime Let the punishment fit the crime
Let the punishment fit the crime
Let the punishment fit the crime
Let the punishment fit the crime 
n Now that you're gone, I feel the pain
My heart trembles, I call your name
I miss your touch, your soft blonde hair.
I keep searching for an answer, but, it just ain't there And I don't want to live this life
And I don't want to live this life
And I don't want to live this life
Anymore Everywhere I turn, the finger points at me.
You'll never understand, I'm in misery.
'Cause baby without you I have no one
Oh, my sweet darling what have I done And I don't want to live this life
And I don't want to live this life
And I don't want to live this life Anymore She smiled at me as I held her carefully.
Her last words were "I love you", thought it set me free.
And I can't forget that look on her face
It looked like an angel as she died in my embrace And I don't want to live this life And I don't want to live this life

And I knew I had to run away
And get down on my knees and pray that they go away Still it begins
Needles and pins
Because of all my pride
The tears I gotta hide Oh, I thought I was smart
I stole her heart
Didn't think I do but now I see
She's worse to him than me Let her go ahead
Take his love instead
And one day she will see
Just how to say please And get down on her knees
Oh, that's how it begins
She'll feel those needles and pins
Oh no, oh no Why can't I stop and tell myself I'm wrong, I'm wrong, so wrong?
Why can't I stand up and tell myself I'm strong? Because I saw her today

Navy blue book bag on my back Couple miles 'til I'm at the grey hound station
Hope they let me ride away with them Got pretty mad at my father today
But I'm still thinkin bout what my mother would say As I'm singin an old song she used to sing
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to I wanna run away
I do
I wanna run away
I do
I wanna run away
I do
I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school
I do
I wanna leave this town
I do
But she'll be worried sick if
I do (if I do) Can't run away and leave my mama alone
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy
Just don't So I turn around and headed to the old run down building
Bells gonna ring before I make it back I watch the upper class men drive right past me
Wish they'd let me ride away with them
Still haven't got over it yet
It's been playin in my ears all mornin I swear My iPods the same tune my mother would sing
When things weren't goin the way she wanted them to I wanna run away
I do
I wanna run away
I do
I wanna run away
I do
I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school
I do
I wanna leave this town
I do
But she'll be worried sick if
I do (if I do) Can't run away and leave my mama alone
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
Cause I'm her boy Mama's boy
Just don't Never get mad enough to walk out
If I do then I won't be gone for long Never fed up enough to leave her
No matter what I'll love her just the same That's my mama
Yeah
So no matter what I leave unless he's coming soon Can't run away and leave my mama alone

And there's a new voice Sayin' "we're not afraid to die"
Let the old world make believe It's blind and deaf and dumb
But nothing can change the shape of things to come There are changes Lyin' ahead in every road
And there are new thoughts Ready and waiting to explode
When tomorrow is today The bells may toll for some
But nothing can change the shape of things to come The future's comin' in, now Sweet and strong
Ain't no-one gonna hold it back for long There are new dreams Crowdin' out old realities
There's revolution Sweepin' in like a fresh new breeze
Let the old world make believe It's blind and deaf and dumb
(But) nothing can change the shape of things (4X) To come [Instrumental] I met her at the 7-11 now Im in the 7th
Heaveb tell me, tell me can this be true
I never thought Id ever meet a girl like you She was standing by the space invaders so I said

Spin down to teh holiday inn We was young and in love we was young and in love
And youre the only girl Im ever thinking of We went down to the record swap the kids were
Dancing to the blitzkrieg bop bop-shoo-wop
Shoo-wop shoo-wop bop-shoo-wop shoo-wop shoo-wop What ever happened to the radio and where did all

Into a whole romance and after just one night
I never knew things could be so right
Oh-no-no-no-no-no-no-no I kissed and hugged her and I said good-bye
Last thing I knew she wouldnt make it alive
Oncoming car went out of control it crushed
My baby and it crushed my soul now all ive
Got is sorrow and pain standing out here
In the rain the crash, shattering glass,
The sirens and pain is driving me insade oh-yeah We was young and in love we was young and in love

Ran out of paint and roach spray too It's TV's fault why I am this way
