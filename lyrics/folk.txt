It's one for Jo
Don't let your man go
He's a dreamer darling
He's even kinda slow
I don't believe the tales he tells
But they're always nice to hear
He's a dreamer darling
Always keep him near In a white tuxedo
He's remarkably cool
A prince of living
Who knows all the rules
In a black sedan so royally
He takes his love to school
And no-one can reproach him
No-one but a fool He's a bold sea captain
In his boots and oilskin hat
Struggling blindly
Through seas wild and black
Down the river he glides
With his baby by his side
And when you think of that gal
How can your love hide It's one for Jo
Don't let your man go
He's a dreamer darling
He's even kinda slow
I don't believe the tales he tells
But they're always nice to hear
He's a dreamer darling
Always keep him near Freedom fighters speak with your tongues
Sing with the might of the wind
In your lungs, do you hear me now?
My mama told me, papa said it too
Son, the world's divided and you know
Your cause is true, do you hear me now?
Can you see those mushrooms seed and burst
Spreading through our valleys breeding hunger
Breeding thirst. Do you hear me now? Snowing in the winter, blossoms in the spring
If they drop the bomb in the summertime
It don't mean a dog-gone thing
Do you hear me now?
Do you hear me now? Freedom fighters speak with your tongues
Sing with the might of the wind
In your lungs, do you hear me now?
Do you hear me now? I don't believe I've seen
a woman like you anywhere.
And I must admit that I can't see
to making you into a dream.
But if I had a magical wonder word,
I'd send a dove to catch your love
and I send a blackbird to steal your heart. But a broken heart won't go,
my endless search, little girl,
I gonna fix a magical spell
to weave on you, little girl.
I'll fall along that you catch the wind
upon the orange to sweetest sin
before this very moment evil in. I'd rather wait at the dark
of thousand times, little girl,
and take the woman until
the heart of my soul.
And if I catch you sleeping along the west
and gave you alone my secret way.
But I bind your heart unto me very slow. I don't believe I've seen
a woman like you anywhere.
And I must admit that I can't see
to making you into a dream.
And if I had a magical wonder word,
I send a dove to catch your love
and I send a blackbird to steal your heart. Runnin runnin from home,
Breakin ties that you'd grown
Catchin dreams from the clouds The city sounds burn your soul
Turn your head to the cries
Of loneliness in the night Just like a fly when it's caught
The spider soon takes it's prey
Spins a dance round your heart Give me your beauty and age
A pleasure pleasing my mind
Your heart will shatter and fall Step on pavements so old
Cast a glance at the young
Girls a-making their way The passing image of you
Reflects a pain to my heart
And disappears in a crowd Runnin runnin from home
Breakin ties that you'd grown
Catchin dreams from the clouds It's one for Jo
Don't let your man go
He's a dreamer darling
He's even kinda slow

Breakin ties that you'd grown
Catchin dreams from the clouds Like a high stepping pony strutting and prancing
Ah she's so full of life
Sparkling with tiny red roses
Let there be music to please her
Let it be sunbright to light up her day
Let the moon light her night
And fill her with deep silent sleepiness
If I were a small bird so tiny
I'd hide in her hair just to be near her
To hear her sweet voice
And feel her sweet body beside me
And if I were a high lord with riches
I'd clothe her in satin from India's far highlands
I would shoe her in gold
Then invite her to sit at my table
Step out young lady a dancing
To the sound of sweet music so gaily come singing
For your beauty so rare
Is as fresh as a sweet Sunday morning My old hen, she's a good ol hen
She lays eggs for the railroad men
Sometimes eight and sometimes ten
That's enough for the railroad men Chorus
Cluck ol hen cluck when I tell you
Cluck ol hen or I'm gonna sell you
Last time she cackled she cackled in the lot
Next time she cackles cackles in the pot My old hen, she's a good ol hen
She lays eggs for the railroad men
Sometimes one and sometimes two
Sometimes enough for the whole damn crew Chorus
Cluck ol hen cluck and sing
You ain't laid an egg since late last spring
Cluck ol hen cluck and call
You ain't laid an egg since late last fall I have no time to spend with you
You talk of nothing, what can you do
You live like kings and you know it's true
That if famine crossed the waters that'll be the end of you. I've heard of people who till the earth
Who saw their seeds for all they're worth
Who cry for rain all summer long
And weep for the day when winter's passed and gone. If cherry trees bore fruit of gold
The birds would die, their wings would fold
They'd sing no more their song of love
Nor await the morning sun that lights the sky above. If war returns like it did before
A kiddy's penny would be no more
They'd cry for love and their candy too
But a kiddy's wants are nothing till killin days are thru. So drink your fill be happy now
The times will change and you'll wonder how
A man could die from lack of food
But you don't give a damn, no reason why you should. When sadness fills your heart
And sorrow hides the longing to be free
When things go wrong each day
You fix your mind to scape your misery Your troubled young life
Had made you turn
To a needle of death How strange, your happy words
Have ceased to bring a smile from everyone
How tears have filled the eyes
Of friends that you once had walked among Your troubled young life
Had made you turn
To a needle of death One grain of pure white snow
Dissolved in blood spread quickly to your brain
In peace your mind withdraws
Your death so near your soul can't feel no pain Your troubled young life
Had made you turn
To a needle of death Your mother stands a cryin
While to the earth your body's slowly cast
Your father stands in silence
Caressing every young dream of the past Your troubled young life
Had made you turn
To a needle of death Through ages, man's desires
To free his mind, to release his very soul
Has proved to all who live
That death itself is freedom for evermore And your troubled young life
Will make you turn
To a needle of death
Walk quietly by, he won't bother you
He's a busy man, he's got things to do
All day long he's happy in his world
Picking up the leaves
Cleaning up his own back yard In summer heat, in winter snow
You'll find him picking up the papers that people throw
All day long he's happy in his world
Picking up the leaves
Cleaning up his own back yard There's no rhyme nor reason, walking the streets of this wide world
Can't find anything to rest this troubled mind
Please help me I keep asking
Everybody's so busy that they wont stop
I got to keep on moving, to rest this troubled mind He dosn't care, nor does he know
Of the outside world that comes and goes
All day long he's happy in his world
Picking up the leaves
Cleaning up his own back yard So walk quietly by, he won't bother you
He's a busy man, he's got things to do
All day long he's happy in his world
Picking up the leaves
Cleaning up his own back yard. Come back baby
Please do not go
How much I love you
You never know Come back baby
Talk it over one more time Love you woman
You know that I do
Love you baby
All the way through Come back baby
Talk it over one more time I woke up this mornin
Baby you've gone
Is there any crime without doubt? Come back baby
Talk it over one more time Come back oh, to me
Love you baby
Oh, set me free Come back baby
Talk it over one more time Come back girl
Please do not go
How much I love you
You never know Come back baby
Talk it over one more time Green are your eyes
In the morning, when you arise
Don't you be afraid to lie
By me, my love,
Your father will not know. Love can be broken,
Though no words are spoken,
Don't you be afraid to lie
By me, my love,
Your father will not know. Love be bold,
We're not so old,
Don't you be afraid to lie
By me, my love,
Your father will not know. Love don't cry,
I'll not try,
Don't you be afraid to lie
By me, my love,
Your father will not know. Green are your eyes
In the morning, when you rise
Don't you be afraid to lie
By me, my love
Your father will be told someday
About our wedding day
So early in the spring
A flower dances in my heart
Where love was not before
For you I sing my song of love
And lowly bow Strolling down the highway
I'm gonna get there my way
Dusk till dawn I'm walkin
Can hear my guitar rocking? While I stroll on down
On down the highway People think, I'm a crazing
The Lord above ain't lazing
The sunshine's all day long
far too strong While I stroll on down
On down the highway While I stroll on down
On down the highway The cars won't stop for no one
They don't think that you're just rolling down
They think you're an OAS spy
Gonna shoot them as they go by No cars, they won't stop
Won't stop for no one Strolling down the highway
And I'm gonna get there my way
Dusk till dawn I'm walkin
Can hear my guitar rocking? While I stroll on down
On down the highway There comes a time babe when we've gotta go
Our time has been
Great up till now but we've gotta go love
Hit the road and start another show
One too many mornings we've been lazing
And one too many
Nights of foolin round babe not caring
And not knowing how we're faring
We're living side by side babe not knowing
Where we are bound or
Where on earth love we are going
And our seed of love still growing
Comes the spring next year love we could be laughing
We could be riding high and
Free with the sun upon our backs, could be singing
And with the birds a-winging
Let us pack our things and leave tonight babe
Keep going till the
Road runs out and comes to an end babe
And hope that life turns out right INSTRUMENTAL When you're feeling lonesome

Don't be alone and blue
Pick up the phone and call me

Is cloudy and grey

Pick up the phone and call me
I'll come running straight to you
If you're looking for love
I've got a cure for the lonesome blues. When you're feeling lonesome
I'll tell you what you do
Pick up the phone and tell me, honey
Don't be alone and blue
Pick up the phone and call me
I'll come running straight to you
If you're looking for love
I've got a cure for the lonesome blues I'm a travelling man, a-moving
You name it I've been there
And night and day I strive to sell my wares
Got nothing I can show you
Nothing you can wear
But hang around a while and lend an ear While travellin on a freight-train
On the Rocky Island line
My young love said to me
My mother, she don't mind
And through twelve gates of the city
I came into my prime
I was singing songs of wild mountain thyme Sing little birdie
From the greenwood side-o
Where the trees they do grow high
Come say hello
Summer is a-coming
And I'm standing on the shore
And where I'm bound Oh Lord, I can't be sure
From the Arizona dustbowl
Out to Van Diemons land
To the North-West Passage snowbound
Where Lord Franklin made his stand
While high above I'm flying
With my guitar in my hand
Thinking about one tiny grain of sand If anyone should ask me
If I be a rambling boy
The sporting life
I know I have enjoyed
Met a lady from Louisville
A-pleasing to my mind She took my hand and said
Would you please be kind
And from the foggy dew I stumbled
Into a shady grove
Where the redbird sang his sweet song He sang of careless love
And the bells of Rhymney rang out
And brought the people round
Saying welcome to your friendly travelling man
Welcome to your friendly travelling man INSTRUMENTAL I'm sorry if I failed you, for that I take the blame
And I'm sorry if I snubbed you, I hang my head in shame
But those people you call friends did you much more harm than good
I should've tried much harder to reach out when i could When the children come to visit you, you break into a smile
They fill your heart with sunshine, just for a little while
You made a model airplane to teach them how to fly
But when it crashed on the runway, you didn't ask the pilot why I got the lady from Baltimore stuck on my mind
Bringing back those high days, when we would hang around
You play your guitar, but you never ever finish the song
Didn't matter than, I guess it doesn't matter now I got the lady from Baltimore stuck on my mind
Bringing back those high days, when we would hang around
You play your guitar, but you never ever finish the song
Didn't matter than, and I guess it doesn't matter now And I guess it doesn't matter now I guess it doesn't matter now To be exposed
In all my strife
You gaze upon
My troubled life
But it don't bother me
What you see
No, oh no
It just don't bother me You take my name
And hang it high
You paint my picture
With colored lies
But it don't bother me
What you do
No, oh no
It just don't bother me You twist my words
Like plaited reeds
To mark your gain
And help your needs
But it don't bother me
What you say
No, oh no
It just don't bother me What truth is told
Of who I am
Shall break the silence
Of waters calm
But it don't bother me
Who I am
No, oh no
It just don't bother me But if was
A beggar boy
I'd sing of riches
I could enjoy
But it, it don't bother me
What they are
No, oh no
It just don't bother me I'm a thinkin now
I would rather hide
Or turn my back
And stand aside
But it, it don't bother me
What I do
No, oh no
It just don't bother me Crimson moon
In the early morning
Blue black sky
Tell me why
If she loves me
My baby drives me wild
Like a little child
She's standing on the edge, she wants to learn to swim
She looks in the water but she won't dive in
Crimson moon
Tell me why She's like a new spring flower
Come out to play
In a gray day in autumn
She brightens up the day
But does she know that winter's coming?
Jack Frost in on his way
You've got to hide little girl from his icy stare
Run back to the sunshine he won't catch you there
Run little girl run Crimson moon
In the early morning
Blue black sky
Tell her I love her
She will listen to you
Tell her she can hear the heartbeat of an dragonfly
In full flight
Taste the spring water of a mountain stream
And feel the burning kiss of a lover's dream
Tell her I love her
She will listen to you
Tell her I love her
She will know that it's true Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always,
Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday. Now all you men's the same
But now I'm old enough to change my name.
Lord, that sun's gonna shine in my back door someday. I'm gonna lay my head
On that lonesome railroad line
And let the 2:19 ease my troubled mind. Trouble in mind, I'm blue,
But I won't be blue always.
Child, that wind's gonna come and blow my blues awayWhile walking along on a rocky sea shore
On a wild wet windy day
I heard a sweet voice cry in the wind
Saying Lover come to me 
Over the jagged rocks I scrambled
Fingers cut down to the core
Saw the light of a lady
She was sitting alone on the shore
 Lady all alone please tell me,
Why do you cry for me?
Why do sit in the cold and sing,
Sing out to the sea? Well I sing for my loved ones
Lost in the silvery sea
Sing for my homeland so dear
Sing to draw your heart near.
So please kind sir will you help me
To find my way home
I've travelled the seven blue oceans.
Now I'm stranded here all alone
My brothers they are dying
From a plague running wild and free
Their bodies all covered in the blackest of oil
That floats on top of the sea.
And my sisters are in hiding
Afraid others may see their shame
Their bodies all twisted, broken and lame
Deep in the watery main.
So please kind sir will you help me
To find my way home
I've travelled the seven blue oceans,
How I'm stranded here all alone.
If you promise you will take me
To the edge of the silvery sea
I'll give you all your heart's desires
All your eyes they do see Over the jagged rocks I carried her
To the edge of the silvery sea
I laid her down and kissed her sweet lips
Saying Lover, now you are free 
But she clung on to my arms
And she would not let me be
She clung on so fast she pulled me down
Down to the bottom of the sea In the bleak midwinter,
Long long ago,
Earth stood hard as iron,
Water like a stone.
Snow had fallen,
Snow on snow, snow on snow,
In the bleak midwinter,
A long long time ago. What can I give Him,
Poor as I am?
If I were a shephard,
I would give a lamb,
And if I were a wise man,
I'd duly play my part. What can I give him?
I will give my heart. Earth stood hard as iron,
Frosty winds did blow,
In the bleak midwinter
A long long time ago. Ask me why a rambler aint got no home
Ask me why I sit and cry alone
I wish I knew, I wish I knew
If I knew, I'd know what to do
Day in, day out seems I'm a-runnin all on my own
Day in, day out there is weakness a-growin in my bones
Wo, it aint no use, nah, it aint no use
My mind is dead I got to turn my body loose
Wish Mama you could hear the words that I cry
wish Mama now at home I could die
But my time is late, my time is late I'm on my own and Lord I've got it straight
No girl I've loved has ever held me down
No reason can I give for leaving this town
My love is true now, my love is true
But the road is long, I've got to see my journey through
So Girl, don't deny the freedom that's born to me
Girl don't deny that a rambler must always be free
Someday you'll see now, Babe, someday you'll see
That my ramblin's gonna be the death of me INSTRUMENTAL I'll sing you this October song
There's no song before it
The words and tune are none of my own
For my joys and sorrows bore it
Beside the sea the brambly briars
ln the still of evening
Birds fly out behind the sun
And with them l'll be leaving The faIIen leaves that jewel the ground
They know the art of dying
And leave with joy their glad gold hearts
In scarlet shadows Iying
When hunger calls my footsteps home
The morning follows after
l swim the seas within my mind
And the pine trees laugh green laughter i used to search for happiness
l used to follow pleasure
But i found a door behind my mind
And that's the greatest treasure
For rulers like to lay down laws
And rebels like to break them
And the poor priests like to walk in chains i met a man whose name was time
He said I must be going
But just how long ago that was
l have no way of knowing
Somelimes i want to murder time
Sometimes when my heart's aching
But mostly i just stroll along
The path that he is taking l'll sing you this October Song
There is no song before it
The words and tune are none of my own
For my joys and sorrows bore it
Beside the sea the brambly briars
In the cool of evening
The birds fly out behind the sun
And with them l'll be Ieaving Driving through the wind and rain
Got my baby beside me too
Baby, we're going home
Just me and you I don't mind the drizzling rain
Inside it is warm and dry
Hey baby, we're going home
I'll kiss the blues bye-bye See the raindrops dance on the highway
a million starlights bright
Baby, we've got to keep on trucking,
Trucking tonight There's a truck stop sign up ahead
Glistening in the rain
Maybe we could stop a little while
Then back on the road again So lay back your pretty little head
And dream the night away
Dream of a snow white pillow
And a great big feather bed Driving through the wind and rain
Got my baby beside me too
Hey, baby, we're going home
Just me and you Strolling down the highway
I'm gonna get there my way
Dusk till dawn I'm walkin
Can hear my guitar rocking? While I stroll on down
On down the highway People think, I'm a crazing
The Lord above ain't lazing
The sunshine's all day long
far too strong While I stroll on down
On down the highway While I stroll on down
On down the highway The cars won't stop for no one
They don't think that you're just rolling down
They think you're an OAS spy
Gonna shoot them as they go by No cars, they won't stop
Won't stop for no one Strolling down the highway
And I'm gonna get there my way
Dusk till dawn I'm walkin
Can hear my guitar rocking? While I stroll on down
On down the highway One morning fair I took he air
Down by blackwater side
Twas gazing all around me
The Irish lad I spied
All through the fore part of the night
We lay in sport and play
Till this young man arose and gathered his clothes
Saying fare thee well today
That's not the promise that you gave to me
When first you lay on my breast
You could make me believe with your lying tongue
That the sun rose in the west
Well, then go home to your father's garden
Go home and weep your fill
And think on your own misfortune
That you've brought with your want and will Put on your cloud stepping shoes, and dance
Shake off the lonely bad blues, take a chance
Seek out and find a green jade pool
Hide behind the moon
Don't let the judges sing your name
Remember from where you came He rolls and tumbles and he laughs, when he speaks
And heaven's sweet wine brings a blush, to his cheeks
Who showed him the way to live forever
Longer than anyone
For he stole the petals from the dying sun
Fresh when the day was done Now over the seas o'r the mountains, he calls
There must be a way I can stay, Lord immortal
Wanna go to heaven on my flying trapeze
Eat all the fruit I please
Wanna drink my fill of that heavenly wine
Till the judges call my time Chorus
Stone monkey gather your family round
And follow the sun on down Hey girl, oh how your love is strong
Weaves a tumble-in tearless song
Tho you don't seem to care that you love is blind.
You don't seem to care not realise. Hey girl, oh how my heart is torn,
Hey girl, now that your baby's born,
What shall it cost? Is my freedom lost?
What is the price of nature's own way. Hey girl, how could I dress your child,
When this life girl I'm livin so wild?
Will your newborn child grow to be as wild?
And walk alone to meet his destiny? Hey girl, see how I stand a man,
Hey girl, see I've no father's hand.
Would it be a crime to leave at such a time,
When you've many claims to make on me? The Black Knight surveys all before him
His charger is thumping the ground
High on a hill the high Bishop looks down
From his men to the horses
Not a whisper of sound
They're all dressed for the battle
And their colours fly high
And flutter in the wind The White Queen her face red with anger
Turns to her left and her right
To the men of the King's Knight she screams and yells
Let them know that you come from the fires of Hell.
And we'll give them a fight Like a black painted shadow
Unmoved and unhurried
One look from her eye and her kingsmen they roar
And into the battle Iike never before The King's bishop he moves his men forward
To guard his knight's men up ahead
For fear of the Queen and Iove for their King
They'll fight till they win or they'll fight till they're dead Like a black hare that's chased by the Devil
Over the battlefield she flies like the wind
She turns and looks down the path to her prey
This time she swears that you can't get away
Nobody can save you
And there's nothing can stop me
l will have my way, five, six, seven, eight,
We're counting the dying the dead and bereaved
And some of the living you'd never believe
For they ain't got no arms and they ain't got no heads
And the cost of this war here is written in red. i am the joker, my friend is the Fool
He's been playing the fool since he started at school
When the battle is over and the reckoning's done
We'II sing you a song and we'll tell you who's won. We sing for the King and we dance for the Queen
We fall and tumble never question our fate
For he's never early and I'm never late
When he's playing the tool then i am the fool's mate. 

When you're down and troubled
And you need a helping hand
And nothing, oh, nothing is going right
Just close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night You just call out my name

But I always thought that I'd see you again
Been walking my mind to an easy time my back turned towards the sun Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
Well there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
I've seen fire and I've seen rain I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you baby one more time again now
Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around now
Thought I'd see you thought I'd see you fire and rain now
Na, na na na-na-na-na There's a bright golden haze on the meadow

The corn is as high as an elephant's eye

Oh, what a beautiful day
I've got a wonderful feelin
Every thing's goin my way All the cattle are standin like statues
All the cattle are standin like statues

And oh, what a beautiful day
I've got a wonderful feelin
Every thing's goin my way All the sounds of the earth are like music
All the sounds of the earth are like music

When I'm gone James Taylor
There is a young cowboy he lives on the range
His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and he sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for Summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinking about women and glasses of beer
And closing his eyes as the doggies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear
Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rock-a-bye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rock-a-bye sweet baby James
Now the first of December was covered with snow
And so was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
Lord, the Berkshires seemed dreamlike on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go
There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me
Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rock-a-bye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rock-a-bye sweet baby James Hey girls, gather round

and fades away like summer dew Build me a boat that can carry two
and both shall row

I have to smile myself
Because I love you
And when you give me that pretty little pout

And all my cares just drift right into space On the roof it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below, it don't bother me No no no So when I come home feeling tired and beat
I'll go up where the air is fresh and sweet for me now
I get far away from the hustling crowd
And all that rat race noise down in the street Oh on the roof, that's the only place that I know
Look at the city baby
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Lets go up on my roof And at night the stars, they put on a show for free
And darlin you can share it all with me Hear what I say

I've found a paradise just about trouble proof
And if this old world starts a getting you down
Well there's room enough for two up on my roof Up on the roof
Up on the roof
Up on the roof, ohh
Everything is alright

You and I There You are again
I climbed so high
High enough to finally see your side
Shining in the distance
You were tending your own fire
We were biding our time
Both of us waiting for the moment when our
backs would come together
You and I I see how fierce You are Never this world would drag us down
How serious You are Standing on Holy Ground And so Although I know we are only small
In the time We have here Maybe We have it all I see how fierce You are Never this world would drag us down
How serious You are Standing on Holy Ground And so Although I know we are only small
In the time We have here This time we have it all You and I again This time, This time I've been wanderin early late
From new york city to the golden gate
And it don't look like
I'll ever stop my wanderin My daddy was an engineer
My brother drives a hack
My sister takes in laundry
While the baby balls the jack
And it don't look like
I'll ever stop my wanderin I've been in the army
I've worked on a farm
And all I've got to show is the muscle in my arm
And it don't look like
I'll ever stop my wanderin My ma she died when I was young
My daddy took to stealin and he got hung
And it don't look like
I'll ever stop my wanderin Snakes in the ocean
Eels in the sea
I let a redheaded woman make a fool out of me
And it don't look like
I'll ever stop my wanderin I've been wanderin early late
From the new york city to the golden gate
And it don't look like
I'll ever stop my wanderin
No, it don't look like
I'll ever stop my wanderin Oh, the summer time is coming,
And the trees are sweetly blooming,
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the blooming heather. Will you go, lassie, go?
And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather,
Will you go lassie, go? I will build my love a bower
By yon clear and crystal fountain,
And on it I will pile
All the flowers of the mountain. I my true love, she won't have me,
I will surely find another
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather. Oh, the summer time is coming
And the trees are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the blooming heather Oh every day
It's a getting closer
Going faster than a roller coaster
With a love like yours
Will surely come my way Yeah, every day
Seems a little faster
All my friends
They say go on up and ask her
With a love like yours
Will surely come my way Oh every day seems a little stronger
And every day lasts a little longer

Tell me lies but hold me tight,
Save your goodbyes for the morning light,
But don't let me be lonely tonight. Say goodbye and say hello,
Sure enough good to see you, but it's time to go,
Don't say yes but please don't say no,
I don't want to be lonely tonight. Go away then, damn you,
Go on and do as you please,
You ain't gonna see me gettin down on my knees.
I'm undecided, and your heart's been divided,
You've been turning my world upside down. Do me wrong, do me right right now baby,
Go on and tell me lies but hold me tight.
Save your goodbyes for the morning light morning light,
But don't let me be lonely tonight.
I don't want to be lonely tonight.
No, no, I don't want to be lonely tonight. I don't want to be lonely tonight. Spoken Intro:
In a world like today
Its a rare occasion to be able
To see young mothers like the ones
That were around when I grew up
But they live on in memory
To quite a few of us
And this song is dedicated
To those who cherish that memory
Early one Sunday morning
Breakfast was on the table
There was no time to eat
She said to me, boy, hurry to Sunday school Filled with her load of glory
We learned the holy story
She'll always have her dreams
Despite the things this troubled world can bring Oh, Sadie
Don't you know we love you
Sweet Sadie
We love you Sadie
Place no one above you Sweet Sadie
Well, well, well
Living in the past
Some times it seems so funny
Mo money will turn your life around Sweeter than cotton candy
Stronger than papee's old brandy
Always that needed smile
Once in awhile she would break down and cry Some times shed be so happy
Just being with us and daddy
Standing the worst of times
Breaking the binds
With just a simple song Oh, Sadie
Sadie
Mae
Don't you know we love you sweet Sadie
Ah darlin
Place no one above you sweet Sadie
Sadie Mae
You're livin in the past
Ever since the beginnin
It's a love that was always winnin, Oh
Sadie
Sadie Mae
Don't you know we love you sweet Sadie
Well, we love ya Sadie
Place no one above you sweet Sadie
Livin in the past

Sadie
Sadie Mae
Don't you know we love you sweet Sadie
My Sadie Mae oh . . .
Place no one above you sweet Sadie
Well, well, well

It's the love, that you gave us all
Sadie

Don't you know we love you sweet Sadie
I love you momma
Place no one above you sweet Sadie
I miss you momma, yeah
Livin in the past

Livin in the past
Sometime I feel so all alone
Do do do, do do do
But I know I've got to carry on
Do do do, do do do
Sadie
It's a mean world without you
Sadie
But I know I gotta go on
Sweet Sadie
It's what you wanted for me
Livin in the past
Sweet Sadie
Do do do, do do do
Oh . . .

Sweet Sadie

Livin in the past . . .
Do do do, do do do

And the light between us
Which we could not quite extinguish
Which we see at dawn
Burns on First day of May
Things are beginning
Our side is winning
Hip hip hooray
Made in the shade
Deep in the shadow
Down by the meadow
Lie in my arms And the moon will rise
Before our very eyes
We will rise too
I'll be with you
It's a rite of spring
A horizontal thing
The sweetest sort of dance
Hidden in among the plants Ha ha ha ha
People are laughing
Children are singing
Come join the dance And the walls around us
Which we kept at such a cost
When we turned around
Came tumbling down Ha ha ha ha
She can't stop laughing
He can't stop singing
First day of May Long ago, but not so very long ago
The world was different, oh yes it was
You settled down and you built a town and made it live
And you watched it grow
It was your town Time goes by, time brings changes, you change, too
Nothing comes that you can't handle, so on you go
Never see it coming, the world caves in on you
On your town
Nothing you can do. Main street isn't main street anymore
Lights don't shine as brightly as they shone before
Tell the truth, lights don't shine at all
In our town Sun comes up each morning
Just like it's always done
Get up, go to work, start the day
Open up for business that's never gonna come
As the world rolls by a million miles away Main street isn't main street anymore
No one seems to need us like they did before
It's hard to find a reason left to stay
But it's our town
Love it anyway
Come what may, it's our town. Paris rooftops were lovely to see
Switzerland's vertical landscape
Crossed my mind's eye just now
Canada's shoreline has been calling out to me
But it's been too long a time
Since last I crossed
That vast Nantucket sound 
Hello old friend
Welcome me home again
Well, I've been away
But that's all over now
Say I can stay for October, now
Stay a while and play Little dog David
I must look like a fool
I should've remembered
You'd be forgetting my smell, well
Give me a week or two to recapture my cool
I've got stories to tell
About how I snatched the devil's catch
And out ran the hounds of hell  James Taylor
Little David, play on your harp
Hallelu, hallelu, little David
Play on your harp, hallelujah
Little David, play on your harp
hallelu, hallelu, little David
Play on your harp, hallelujah
Hey now, I don't know for sure
It's gets said, I got told
Some one said that the streets of heaven
Are paved with solid gold
It must make a might fine road
Little David
Little David, play on your harp
Hallelu, hallelu, hallelujah
Play on your harp, hallelujah Oleana, via Del Norte, O Canada
It was snowtime, it was showtime, it was no time
To be lost in downtown Toronto
It was wintertime, round dinnertime
I'm beginning to see that the sunshine just doesn't want to From a side street come a backbeat
Pulling on me like the moon pullin on the tide
Ay caramba, one-note samba, la la la la bamba
Lighting me up inside They had the heat of the sun in the beat of the talking drum
The light of a tropical moon on a night to remember
Someone summoned up summer just strumming on an old guitar
And every note was the antidote to December My first impression, some kind of procession
Pulling on a long line of fancy dancers
A band stuck up on a flatbed truck
They were raising a ruckus swinging for the fences Exiled Mexican textile working
Punching two clocks, sending two paychecks home boys
Hard working law biding bus riding people
Celebration on wheels destination unknown They had the heat of the sun in the beat of the talking drum
The light of a tropical moon on a night to remember
Someone summoned up summer just strumming on an old guitar
And every note was the antidote to December Rio Grande
Oleana
Via Del Norte
Oh Canada There was a lifeline south in the song coming from her mouth
It swallowed me up and I followed it on downtown
In the light of dawn the message that life goes on
For the frozen man an invitation to live again They had the heat of the sun in the beat of the talking drum
The light of a tropical moon on a night to remember
Someone summoned up summer just strumming on an old guitar
And every note was the antidote to December They were shakin it loose with the juice from the mambo man
Long lanky Yankee boy, Buckwheat and Spanky my my Santiago de Cuba
Belo Horizonte
Cartagena
Guaguancó Canada
Guaguancó Canada Ever since the days of old,
Men would search for wealth untold.
They'd dig for silver and for gold,
And they'd leave the empty holes. Way down south in the Everglades,
Where the black water rolls
And the saw grass waves.
The eagles fly and the otters play,
In the land of the Seminole. So blow, blow Seminole wind,
Blow like you're never gonna blow again.
I'm calling to you like a long lost friend,
Cause I know who you are. And blow, blow from the Okeechobee,
All the way up to Micanopy.
Blow across the home of the Seminole,
The alligators and the gar. Progress came and took its toll,
And in the name of flood control,
They made their plans and they drained the land,
Now the glades are going dry. The last time I walked in the swamp,
I sat upon a cypress stump,
I listened close and I heard the ghost,
Of Osceola cry. So blow, blow Seminole wind,
Blow like you're never gonna blow again.
I'm calling to you like a long lost friend
I know who you are. And blow, blow from the Okeechobee,
All the way up to Micanopy.
Blow across the home of the Seminole,
The alligators and the gar. Blow, blow Seminole wind,
Blow like you're never gonna blow again.
I'm calling to you like a long lost friend,
Cause I know who you are. And blow, blow from the Okeechobee,
All the way up to Micanopy.
Blow across the home of the Seminole,
The alligators and the gar.
Blow, Seminole wind
Blow, Seminole wind
Blow, Seminole wind fade out
Now back when this earth was a silver blue jewel
And back when your grandfather's father was young
Men of these shores made and gave up their lives
Pulling up fish from the sea While down in the African slavery trade
Stealing young men to cut sugar cane
Rum to New Bedford and codfish from Maine
They were building a wall that will always remain Oh, the crown and the cross the musket and chain
The white man's religion, the family name
Two hundred years later and who is to blame?
The captain or the cargo or the juice of the sugar cane The doryman he knows when the riptides will run
He sets out his nets and he sits in the sun
He thinks of his family and drinks of his rum
And he waits for the codfish to come It's the same god-damned ocean that keeps them alive
It will swallow you up, it will let you survive
It will heal you and steal you and take you away
Like a note in a bottle with nothing to say Now back when this earth was a silver blue jewel
And back when your grandfather's father was young
Men of these shores made and gave up their lives
Pulling up fish from the sea I'll tell you bout Machine Gun Kelly
he rode along the outlaw trail
Machine Gun Kelly was a simple man
But the woman was as hard as hell
Chorus
Watch out Machine Gun
Don't let her run you round
Don't let a woman put you six feet in the ground
Machine Gun I'll tell you bout Katherine Kelly
Tired of being such small time
Figured they'd kidnap a rich man's son
And make it in the world of crime - Chorus - You'd better watch out Machine Gun Kelly
Careful of what you do now
If you keep listening to your old lady
Ain't no telling what'll happen to you now
Machine Gun The government boys they came for Machine Gun
And took the poor boy away
They stuck him in a hole in Leavenworth prison
Where he lived until his dying day Watch out Machine Gun
Don't let her put you down
Don't let a woman make you out to be a clown
Machine Gun Watch out Machine Gun James Taylor
Sounds of laughter here comes Sunshine
Smiling faces all around
They possess you bless you Sunshine
Now you can never let them down
I say Sunshine
Sunshine, Sunshine
Is that a cloud across your smile or did you dream again last night
It's best you rest inside a while as blue doesn't seem to suit you right
Things ain't what they used to be pain and rain and misery
Illness in the family and Sunshine means a lot to me
I say Sunshine
But could it be Sunshine is drifting with midnight
And lonely when everyone's gone
Blue crystal spirits and gardens in moonlight
Leave weak alone and bleak all quiet and grey by dawn
Sunshine Sunshine
Rising to late to chase the cold and failing to change the frost to dew
She's trading her mood of yellow gold for frost bitten shades of silver
blue
Friends and lovers past and gone and no-one waiting further on
I'm running short of things to be and Sunshine means quiet a lot to me
I say Sunshine, Sunshine James Taylor
There's something in the way she moves,
Or looks my way, or calls my name,
That seems to leave this troubled world behind.
And if I'm feeling down and blue,
Or troubled by some foolish game,
She always seems to make me change my mind.
And I feel fine anytime she's around me now,
She's around me now,
Just about all the time,
And if I'm well you can tell she's been with me now,
She's been with me now quite a long, long time,
And I feel fine.
Every now and then the things I lean on lose their meaning,
and I find myself careening,
Into places where I should not let me go.
She has the power to go where no one else can find me,
and to silently remind me,
of the happiness and good times that I know.
It isn't what she's got to say,
But how she thinks and where she's been,
To me, the words are nice, the way they sound.
I like to hear them best that way,
It doesn't matter what they mean,
She says them mostly just to calm me down.
And I feel fine anytime she's around me now,
She's around me now,
Just about all the time.
And if I'm well you can tell she's been with me now,
She's been with me now quite a long, long time
And I feel fine. End Take to the highway, won't you lend me your name?
your way and my way seem to be one and the same.
mamma don't understand it,
she wants to know where i've been.
i'd have to be some kind of natural born fool
to want to pass that way again,
but you know I could feel it on a country road.
Sail on home to Jesus,
won't you good girls and boys.
i'm all in pieces, you can have your own choice.
but I can hear a heavenly band full of angels
and they're coming to set me free.
I don't know nothing bout the why or when
but I can tell that it's bound to be,
because I could feel it, child, yeah,
on a country road.
I guess my feet know
where they want me to go
walking on a country road.
Take to the highway, won't you lend me your name?
your way and my way seem to be one and the same.
mamma don't understand it,
she wants to know where I've been.
I'd have to be some kind of natural born fool
to want to pass that way again,
but I could feel it on a country road.
Walk on down,
walk on down,
walk on down,
walk on down,
walk on down a country road.
na na na na na na na na na na na,
country road, yeah,
walking on a country road, Sha, sha, sha I probably shouldn't say this
But at times I get so scared
When I think about the previous
Relationship we shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standing in the rain
But nothing's ever goanna change until you hear
My dear The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you
Oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks, and when you act like them, just know it hurts
I want to be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you It's awkward and it's silent
As I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it If you text it I'll delete it
Let's be clear
Oh, I'm not coming back
You're taking seven steps here The seven things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks, and when you act like them, just know it hurts
I want to be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you Compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention
The seven that I like The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You made me laugh, you made me cry, but I guess that's both that I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine when we're intertwined, everything's alright
I want to be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you Sha, sha, you do, oh Well, I came upon a child of god
He was walking along the road
And I asked him, tell me, where are you going
This he told me: Said, I'm going down to yasgur's farm
Gonna join in a rock and roll band
Got to get back to the land
And set my soul free ,
We are stardust
We are golden
We are billion-year-old carbon
And we got to get ourselves
Back to the garden Well then, can I walk beside you?
I have come to lose the smog
And I feel myself a cog
In something turning And maybe it's the time of year
Yes, and maybe it's the time of man
And I don't know who I am
But life is for learning , By the time we got to woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere was a song
And a celebration And I dreamed I saw the bomber jet planes
Riding shotgun in the sky
Turning into butterflies
Above our nation We are stardust
We are golden
We are caught in the devil's bargain
And we got to get ourselves
Back to the garden When liberty valance came to town,
the women folk would hide, they'd hide.
when liberty valance walked around,
the men would step aside
because the point of a gun
was the only law that liberty understood.
when it came to shooting straight and fast,
he was mighty good.
From out of the east a stranger came,
a law book in his hand.
a man, the kind of man the west would need
to ease a troubled land.
because the point of a gun
was the only law that liberty understood.
when it came to shooting straight and fast,
he was mighty good.
Many a man would face his gun
and many a man would fall.
the man who shot liberty valance,
he shot liberty valance,
he was the bravest of them all.
Now the love of a woman can make a man
stay on when he should go, stay on.
just trying to build a peaceful life
where love is free to go.
but the point of a gun
was the only law that liberty understood.
when it came to shooting straight and fast,
he was mighty good.
Alone and afraid she prayed that he'd return
that fateful night, that night.
when nothing she said could keep her man
from going out to fight.
but the point of a gun
was the only law that liberty understood.
when it came to shooting straight and fast,
he was mighty good.
Out in the sun, two shots rang out,
the shots made liberty fall.
the man who shot liberty valance,
he shot liberty valance
he was the bravest of them all. I like to think about the time I met you
Living with your people down in new orleans
Mad at your mama cause she'd never let you
Ride in no nasty limousine
Later on the levee with the moon up above
I lost my heart and confessed my love
Oh lucy, God have mercy
I've got to stop thinkin bout that One summer night in a field of wheat
God's sweet lanterns hanging in the sky
Moving light on your tiny feet
I knew I had to love you till the day I die
They talk about amazing grace
It meant something when I saw your face
Oh lucy, God have mercy
I've got to stop thinkin bout that I think of all the little things that I never told you
I think I may get to hold you someday
It's my brain just like a man possessed
I can't do me no work, I can't get me no rest
I can't understand it baby Don't like to think about the way it ended
I hate remembering the things that I said
I dream a dream of love so splendid
I wake up hard in an empty bed
I wonder who'll be loving you next
Some fool will be writing bad checks
Oh now lucy, God have mercy
I've got to stop thinkin bout you Person to person
And man to man
I'm back in touch
With my long lost friend Listen to reason
And understand
And think of me
From way back when He said me and Melissa
Well, we fell out of love
Ran out of luck
Seems like lightning struck I've been thinkin of leavin
But I can't raise a buck
James, I'm wondering
Could I borrow your truck I said that's why I'm here
That's why I'm here
Got no better reason
That's why I'm standing before you
That's why I'm here
That's why I'm here John's gone found dead
He dies high he's brown bread
Later said to have
Drowned in his bed After the laughter
The wave of the dread
It hits us like a ton of lead It seems learn not to burn 
Means turn on a dime
Walk on if you're walking
Even if it's an uphill climb Try to remember that
Working's no crime
Just don't let em take
And waste your time That's why I'm here
That's why I'm here
There'll be no more messes tonight
That's why I'm here
That's why I'm here
Whoa, that's why I'm here This is an I.O.U.
I reckon I owe you one now
Listen Wendy and listen Gloria
This'll be better tomorrow Oh, fortune and fame's
Such a curious game
Perfect strangers
Can call you by name And pay good money to hear
 Fire And Rain 
Again and again and again Oh, some are like summer
Coming back every year
Got your baby, got your blanket
Got your bucket of beer I break into a grin
From ear to ear
And suddenly
It's perfectly clear That's why I'm here
That's why I'm here
Singing tonight, tomorrow
And every day
That's why standin
That's why I'm here
Whoa, that's why I'm here This is the part
About Kitty and Bim
He loved her
And she loved him Wake em up, shake em up
The middle of the night
You got to tell me
Everything's all right I said that's why I'm here
That's why I'm here
You got me walkin and
Talkin like a natural man
That's why I'm here
That's why I'm here
Whoa, that's why I'm here That's right I am a lineman for the county.
And I drive the mainroad.
Lookin in the sun for another overload. I hear you singing in the wire
I can hear you thru the whine
And the Wichita Lineman,
Well he's still on the line I know I need a small vacation.
But it don't look like rain.
And if it snows that stretch down south,
won't ever stand the strain. And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita Lineman,
Well he's still on the line And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita Lineman,

Still on the line
Still on the line

I ain't gonna feed ya no more Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can see the boats go by
You can spend the night forever
And you know that shes half crazy
But that's why you want to be there
And she feeds you tea and oranges
That come all the way from China
And just when you mean to tell her
That you have no love to give her
She gets you on her wavelength
And she lets the river answer
That you've always been her lover And Jesus was a sailor
When he walked upon the water
And he spent a long time watching
From his lonely wooden tower
And when he knew for certain
Only drowning men could see him
He said all men will be sailors then
Until the seas free them
But he himself was broken
Long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone
And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind. Suzanne takes you hand
And she leads you beside the water
She is wearing rags and feathers
From Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey
On our lady of the harbor
And she shows you where to look
Between the garbage and the flowers There are heroes in the seaweed
There are children in the morning
They are leaning out for love
And they will lean that way forever
While Suzanne holds the mirror And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you can trust her
Because she's touched your perfect body with her mind. In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan,
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,
In the bleak midwinter, long ago. Our God, heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain;
Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign.
In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed
The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ. Enough for Him, Whom cherubim, worship night and day,
Breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay;
Enough for Him, Whom angels fall before,
The ox and ass and camel which adore. Angels and archangels may have gathered there,
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;
But His mother only, in her maiden bliss,
Worshipped the beloved with a kiss. What can I give Him, poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;
If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part;
Yet what I can I give Him: give my heart. James Taylor
Father, let us build a boat and sail away
There's nothing for you here
And brother, let us throw our lot out upon the sea
It's been done before
I'm thinking bout a broken heart
I'm talking bout the break of dawn
You love me while I'm here
Then you can miss me when I'm gone
Sweet misunderstanding
Won't you leave a poor boy alone
I'm the one eyed seed of a tumbleweed
In the belly of a rolling stone
Back on the highway, yeah, yeah, yeah
Back on the road again
I had a little woman in Memphis
She wanted to be my bride
She said, settle on down, traveling man
You can stay right by my side
I tried so hard to please her
But I couldn't hold out too long
Cause one Saturday night I was laying in bed
And I heard that highway song
Back on the highway, yeah, yeah, yeah
Back on the road again
Now one of these days that highway song will lose its appeal to me
I'm gonna settle on down like a natural born man
I'm gonna live my life naturally
Free and easy
Until that day the thunder's gonna roll
And I notice there's a sign of rain
So I grab my bags and I pack my clothes
And I'm back on the road again
Back on the highway, yeah, yeah, yeah
Back on the road again
I'm thinking bout a broken heart
I been talking bout the break of dawn
You loved me while I'm here
and you can miss me when I'm gone
And I said sweet misunderstanding
Won't you leave a poor boy alone
Cause I'm the one eyed seed of a tumbleweed
In the belly of a rolling stone
Back on the highway, yeah, yeah, yeah
Back on the road again
Here I am again
Holiday Inn
Same old four walls again
Gee, but it's fine to be back home again whoa, now
Say, Holiday Inn, I'm on the road again Mount up, move on
May you find the way back home Down and down we go
Down into bright October
Brothers in arms no more
Now that the war is over
Have you waded in and been to hell
Will you lie upon the sofa
see to the decoration of your shell
Now that the war is over Mount up, move on
Damn the darkness, speed the dawn
They lost, we won
Try to find your way back home
Native son Down and down we go
Now that the war is over
Brothers in arms no more
Now that the war is over
Have you waded in and been to hell
Will you lie upon the sofa
see to the decoration of your shell
Now that the war is over Mount up, move on
Damn the darkness, speed the dawn
They lost, we won
May you find your way back home
Native son One morning, one morning, one morning in May
I spied a young couple, a making their way
One was a lady so dainty and fair
And one was a soldier a brave volunteer Good morning, good morning, good morning said he
Where be you going my pretty lady
Oh I'm going out walking because it is spring
Just to see the waters glide and hear the nightingale sing
Just to see the waters glide and hear the nightingale sing They had not been standing but a minute or two
When out of his knapsack a fiddle he drew
And the tune that he played thru the valley did ring
Oh hark said the maiden hear the nightingale sing
Oh hark said the maiden hear the nightingale sing Said the soldier to the lady its time to give over
Oh no pretty soldier play just one tune more
For I'd rather listen to the touch of your string
Than to see the waters glide and hear the nightingale sing
Than to see the waters glide and hear the nightingale sing Said the lady to the soldier will you marry me
Oh no pretty lady that never can be
I've a wife in olde England and children twice three
One wife and the army is a plenty for me
One wife and the army is a plenty for me Well I'll go back to olde England and I'll stay there a year
And it's often that I'll think of you my little dear
And if I return it will be in the spring
Just to see the waters glide and hear the nightingale sing
To see the waters glide and hear the nightingale sing Shall I tell it again how we started as friends
Who would run into one another now and again
At the Yippee Cai O or the Mesa Dupree
Or a dozen different everyday places to be I was loping along living alone
We were ever so brave on the telephone
Would you care to come down for fireworks time
We could each just reach
We step out of line And the smell of the smoke and the lay of the land
and the feeling of finding one's heart in one's hand
and the tiny tin voice of the radio band singing
 love must stand 
Love forever and ever must stand Unbelievable you, impossible me
The fool who fell out of the family tree
The fellow that found the philosopher's stone
Deep underground like a dinosaur bone Who fell into you at a quarter to two
With a tear in your eye for the Fourth of July
For the patriots and the minutemen
And the things you believe they believed in then Such as freedom, and freedom's land
And the kingdom of God and the rights of man
With the tiny tin voice of the radio band
Singing love must stand 
Love forever and ever must stand
And forever must stand Oh the smell of the smoke as we lay on the land
And the feeling of finding my heart in my hand
With the tiny, tin voice of the radio band
Singing love must stand 
Love forever and ever must stand. All on the Fourth of July
On the Fourth of July Some children see Him lily white
The baby Jesus born this night
Some children see Him lily white
With tresses soft and fair Some children see Him bronzed and brown
The Lord of heaven to earth come down
Some children see Him bronzed and brown
With dark and heavy hair Some children see Him almond-eyed
This Saviour whom we kneel beside
Some children see Him almond-eyed
With skin of golden hue Some children see Him dark as they
Sweet Mary's Son to whom we pray
Some children see him dark as they
And, oh they love Him too The children in each different place
Will see the baby Jesus face
Like theirs, but bright, with heavenly grace
And filled with holy light Oh lay aside each earthly thing
And with thy heart as offering
Come worship now the infant King
Tis love that's born tonight Tis love that's born tonight Well I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee
And I'm bound for Louisiana, my own true love for to see
It did rain all night the day I left
The weather was bone dry
The sun was so hot I froze myself
Susanne, don't you go on and cry I said, Oh, Susannah
Now, don't you cry for me
As I come from Alabama with this banjo on my knee Well I had myself a dream the other night
When everything was still
I dreamed that I saw my girl Susanne
She was coming around the hill
Now, the buckwheat cake was in her mouth
A tear was in her eye
I said, that I come from Dixie land
Susanne, don't you break down and cry I said, Oh, Susannah
Now, don't you cry for me
Cause I come from Alabama with my banjo on my knee If I could go down now
While the whole town is sleeping
See the sun creeping up on the hill
I know the river and the railroad
Would run through the valley still I guess it never was much to look at
Just a one-horse town
The kind of place young people want to leave today
Store fronts pretty much boarded up
Main Street pretty much closed down The church bell still rings on Sunday
Old folks still go
The young ones listen on the radio
Saturday night nothing but a stray dog running wild
Like nobody's child And little by little, light after light
That's how it died
They say you never go home again
That's no lie
Its like a letter in the mail
To a brother in jail
It's a matter of time
Until you can do a little bit better time It used to be part of the heartland
Awful proud and strong
But deep, deep down peaceful and serene
When people used to talk about the country
That's what they used to mean I might go down come the weekend
Go on my own
Drop off Annie and the baby
Maybe drive alone
Pay my last respects to a time
That has all but gone We said, Mama come look at the mountain
Fire in the sky
It's lit up like the Fourth of July
The mill burning down
The jobs leaving town
The trains rolling by
And little by little, light after light
That's how it died
They say you never go home again
That's no lie
It's just a letter in the mail
To a brother in jail
It's a matter of time
Until you can do a little bit better time We've seen some hard times, hard times
Holding it together ain't always easy
An angry man, hungry woman
They're driving each other crazy
It's so low down, show down
There's nothing else safe to say
Baby's on the town, baby's looking round
talking bout walking away Don't let go
Got to give it one more chance
We've got to hold on
Loving me may not make much sense
But I'm gone on you, baby
Baby, I'm gone
And I want you back again
I may be wrong for you, baby
Maybe I'm wrong
But I love you just the same Now, we've got to hold on, got to hold on
We've got to hold on, got to hold on
We've got to hold on, got to hold on
We've got to hold on, got to hold on
We've got to hold on, got to hold on Hard times, hard times
Holding it together ain't always easy
Angry man, hungry woman
Driving each other crazy
We've got to hold on through all
Those hard times my heart had been broken
and i couldn't take no more
i shuttered up my windows
and i bolted tight my door
then i took one look at you
and i nearly lost my mind chorus:
now i'm going round going round
going round going around one more time
yes i'm going roung going round
going round goung around one more time betty was a little heartbreaker
it didn't quite work out
she did a number on my confidence
i was riddled with self doubt
i said that's it i'm through i quit
the juanita she looked so fine. chorus round and round in a circle
it's always the same
one moment you swear you've had enough
the next you've got to know her name all on my own it wasn't that bad
i was getting by as i could get
i stopped into a drug store
for one pack of cigarettes
she did't have a quarter
had to call her cousin kate
and could i lend her maybe
one thin dime chorus In line, in line, it's all in line
My ducks are all in a row
They do not change, they do not move
They have nowhere to go I've been talking to a friend of mine
He says making money's just a waste of time
He's a lazy gent, he don't pay no rent
He's all bent out of shape from living in a tent
It's hard to hear what he has to say
Cause everyone around me is just the same way: More, more, daddy gimme some, gimme some
More, more, daddy gimme some more Some kind of funny looking money machine it is
Saddest looking people that I've ever seen
Living in a hole, body and soul
Strung out on the company dole One for a nickel and two for a dime
Time may be money but your money won't buy time In line, in line, it's all in a line
My ducks are all in a row
They do not shift, they do not move
They have nowhere to go Me and my flea we were down by the water
Fell in a hole with Superman's daughter
Living alone, chewing on a bone
Pretty as homemade sin
She had to be high by the look in her eye
Her hands were wet and her mouth was dry
The sun on the moon, the sun on the moon
The sun on the moon made a mighty nice light Bow wow wow, honk your horn In line, in line, it's all in line
My ducks are all in a row
They do not change, they do not move
They have nowhere to go Sometimes I'm hungry, I don't know what to do
You can take a taco to Katama too I hope someone's watching, watching over me.
I hope someone's watching, watching over me. I hope someone's watching, watching over me.
I hope someone's watching, watching over me. All I see is my reflection, I'm running
Like a stranger in the dark.
Come closer, much closer,
I'll always listen, have you something to say
My life chasing, lose it, waste it
You keep me guessing every step of the way. I hope someone's watching, watching over me.
I hope someone's watching, watching over me. Try to find the easy answer, it's nowhere.
So I pay for my mistake.
I'm trying, bad timing,
I almost had it but it slipped away.
No good for me, same old story,
You keep me guessing every step of the way.
I hope someone's watching, watching over me.
I hope someone's watching, watching over me. I've got no reason to pretend, oh no,
But if it's up to me
I know we'll find the perfect ending. I hope someone's watching, watching over me.
I hope someone's watching, watching over me. I hope someone's watching, watching over me.
I hope someone's watching, watching over me. I hope someone's watching, watching over me.
I hope someone's watching, watching over me. Oh, end this day, show me the ocean.
when shall i see the sea?
may this day set me in emotion,
i ought to be on my way.
We were there,
we were sailing on the terra nova.
sailing for the setting sun,
sailing for the new horizon.
may this day show me an ocean,
i ought to be on my way.
Ought to be on my way right now.
stepping on the boat
with a lump in my throat,
on my way right now.
I got a letter from a dear friend of mine,
the story of a spiritual awakening.
she spoke of her love returning in kind,
she let me know that she'd be waiting.
and i should be on my way by now.
walking across the floor,
reaching for the door, on my way by now.
But here i sit,
country fool that i am,
my elbow on my knee
and my chin in my hand.
my mind in the gutter
and my eye on the street,
holed up in a cave of concrete.
and i ought to be on my way right now.
packing my things
while the telephone rings,
on my way right now.
I miss my lovely mother
and i love my lonely father.
i know i owe my brothers one thing
and another, i hear my sister singing.
and i ought to be on my way right now.
moving across the land
with my heart in my hand,
on my way by now,
ought to be on my way by now.
Oh, end this day,
set me in motion.
ought to be on my way.
Out of the west
of lambert's cove,
there's a sail out in the sun.
and i'm on board
though very small,
i've come home to stop yearning.
burn off the haze
around the shore,
turn off the crazy way i feel.
i'll stay away from you no more,
i've come home to stop yearning. Chorus:
Wasn't that a mighty storm
Wasn't that a mighty storm in the morning
Say, wasn't that a mighty storm
Blew all the people away Well, Galveston had a sea wall
Meant to keep the water down
High tide from the ocean
Sent water over Galveston Chorus Yeah, year was 1900
Fifty long years ago
Death came walking on the water that day
Death calls, you gotta go Now the trumpets, they sounded warning
Said it's time to leave this place
But no one thought about leaving town
Til death stared them in the face Chorus Right then the sea started boiling
A thing that no ship could stand
I thought I heard a captain crying out
Somebody save a drowning man They had two trains loaded
With people trying to leave town
Tracks gave way to the water now
And all of those people drowned Chorus I said the year was 1900
Fifty long years ago
Death came walking on the water
Death calls, you gotta go I said Death, your hands are clammy
You got them on my knee
You came and threw a stone at my mother
And now you're coming after me. Chorus Chorus Lonely hearted hunter don't say nothing
The hunger and the hurt
Got only one law
Never mind your words
Unseen, unheard, unsung, undone
Ain't bot one place left to run Stand up, stand and fight Undercover creature that don't see sunshine
Make it in the dark
Don't think twice
Never mind making nice
Black eyes, black sights, black magical rites tonight
There comes a time, babe Stand up, stand and fight Don't you worry bout me little darling
No, I ain't breaking
I'm shaking and aching
cause I can't stand waiting
There comes a time to stand and fight Maximum destruction
Blood red deadheads
Tearing it up, wearing it down
Never mind my name
I'm unclaimed, unnamed and unashamed I'd like to say
Fan the flames
Stand and fight You ain't doing nobody no kind of favors
Lying around like a rug on the floor
Sooner or later you've got to stand up
And say you won't take it any more
Stand up, stand and fight Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon.
Oh, Mud Slide, I'm dependent on you.
I don't know but I've been told,
There's a time from time to time.
I can't eat, I can't sleep
But I just might move my feet.
Cause there's nothing like the sound
Of sweet soul music
To change a young lady's mind.
And there's nothing like a walk on down
By the bayou to leave the world behind, whoa,
Mud Slide I'm depending upon you.
Mister Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon. I've been letting the time go by,
Letting the time go by,
Yes, I'm letting the time go by,
Letting the time go by. I'm gonna cash in my hand
And pick up on a piece of land
And build myself a cabin back in the woods.
Lord, it's there I'm gonna stay
Until there comes a day
When this old world starts
To changing for the good.
Now the reason I'm smiling is over on a island
On a hillside in the woods where I belong.
I wanna thank Jimmy, Jimmy, John, Nick
And Laurie, the No Jets Construction
For setting me down
A homestead on the farm, whoa, ooooo. Mud Slide, I'm depending upon you.
Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon.
Night goes on and on,
Don't want to come at all.
Baby, baby, baby, I know.
Stoney Lee Blue Borne, picking on
A fretless bass, yeah, yeah.
Oil slick, slipping and a sliding
And a slapping on.
Kootcheroo. Gee it's great after staying out late,
Walking my baby back home.
Arm and arm over meadow and farm,
Walking my baby back home. We go on harmonizing a song,
Or she's reciting a poem.
Owls fly by and they give me the eye,
Walking my baby back home. We stop for awhile, she gives me a smile,
And cuddles her cheek to my chest.
We start to pet, and thats when I get
Her powder all over my vest. After I kind of straighten my tie,
She has to borrow my comb.
One kiss then we continue again,
Walking my baby back home. After I kind of straighten my tie,
She has to borrow my comb.
One kiss then we continue again,
Walking my baby back home. Nice night. 

I never felt magic crazy as this
I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea
I never held emotion in the palm of my hand
Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree
But now you're here
Brighten my northern sky I've been a long time that I'm waiting
Been a long time that I'm blown
I've been a long time that I've wandered
Through the people I have known
Oh, if you would and you could
Straighten my new mind's eye Would you love me for my money
Would you love me for my head
Would you love me through the winter
Would you love me til I'm dead

A rose with no thorn Your tears they tell me

For some day our ocean
Will find its shore Betty came by on her way
Said she had a word to say
About things today
And fallen leaves. Said she hadn't heard the news
Hadn't had the time to choose
A way to lose
But she believes. Going to see the river man
Going to tell him all I can
About the plan
For lilac time. If he tells me all he knows
About the way his river flows
And all night shows
In summertime. Betty said she prayed today
For the sky to blow away
Or maybe stay
She wasn't sure. For when she thought of summer rain
Calling for her mind again
She lost the pain
And stayed for more. Going to see the river man
Going to tell him all I can
About the ban
On feeling free. If he tells me all he knows
About the way his river flows
I don't suppose
It's meant for me. Oh, how they come and go
Oh, how they come and go. I could have been a sailor, could have been a cook
A real live lover, could have been a book.
I could have been a signpost, could have been a clock
As simple as a kettle, steady as a rock.
I could be
Here and now
I would be, I should be
But how? 
I could have been
One of these things first
I could have been
One of these things first. I could have been your pillar, could have been your door
I could have stayed beside you, could have stayed for more.
Could have been your statue, could have been your friend,
A whole long lifetime could have been the end.
I could be yours so true
I would be, I should be through and through
I could have been
One of these things first
I could have been
One of these things first. I could have been a whistle, could have been a flute
A real live giver, could have been a boot.
I could have been a signpost, could have been a clock
As simple as a kettle, steady as a rock.
I could be even here
I would be, I should be so near
I could have been
One of these things first
I could have been
One of these things first. Through early morning fog I see
visions of the things to be
the pains that are withheld for me
I realize and I can see, That suicide is painless
it brings on many changes
and I can take or leave it if I please. I try to find a way to make
all our little joys relate
without that ever-present hate
but now I know that it's to late, and,  The game of life is hard to play
I'm going to lose it anyway
the losing card I'll someday lay
so this is all I have to say  The only way to win is cheat
and lay it down before I'm beat
and to another give my seat
for that's the only painless feat  The sword of time will pierce our skins
it doesn't hurt when it begins
but as it works its way on in
the pain grows stronger, watch it grin but,  A brave man once requested me
to answer questions that are key
is it to be or not to be
and I replied oh why ask me? Cause suicide is painless
it brings on many changes
and I can take or leave it if I please,and you can do the same thing if you please. A day once dawned, and it was beautiful
A day once dawned from the ground
Then the night she fell
And the air was beautiful
The night she fell all around. So look see the days
The endless coloured ways
And go play the game that you learnt
From the morning. And now we rise
And we are everywhere
And now we rise from the ground
And see she flies
And she is everywhere
See she flies all around So look see the sights
The endless summer nights
And go play the game that you learnt
From the morning. Deep down in the depths of forgotten dreams
So far away so long ago it seems
The memory comes of a distant beach
Pale sand stretching far from reach
It was then I found my princess of the sand. As I traced the foam, pebbles beneath my feet
I looked behind, I saw this one so sweet
She came to me and I saw in her eyes
The heavy toll of a thousand sighs
I called her my princess of the sand. She stared at me and my mind was in a maze
As we moved along in a summer sea-dream haze
She moved her mouth but there came no sound
The message she brought can never be found
But I called her my princess in the sand. One moment we walked with the night breeze in our face
Then I looked, she'd gone. of her presence there was no trace
Where she went or came from who can know
Or if she'll ever return to help me know
Who she is, my princess of the sand. Sometime when the summer nights come back
I'll go back to the sea, follow that sandy track
I'll look around, and i'll hope to find
That strange young dream, close behind
I'll call her my princess of the sand. Black days of winter all were through
The blossoms came and they brought you
Clouds left the sky
And I knew the reason why
They made way for you and the blossom. The seasons cycle turned again
An april shower now and then
Trees came alive
And the bees left their hive
They came out to see you and the blossom. People were laughing, smiling with the sun
They knew that summer had begun. The nights grew warm, the days grew long
Spring turned to summer and was gone
It seemed so fine
All the cider and the wine
But I knew you'd go with the blossom. When spring returns I'll look again
To find another blossom friend
Until I do
Find something new
I'll just think of you and the blossom. Instrumental Please give me a second grace,
Please give me a second face,
I've fallen far down, the first time around,
Now I just sit on the ground in your way Now, if it's time for recompense for what's done,
Come, come sit down on the fence in the sun,
And the clouds will roll by and we'll never deny,
It's really too hard for the fly Please tell me your second name,
Please play me your second game,
I've fallen so far, of the people you are,
I just need your star for a day So come, come ride in my street-car by the bay,
For now, I must know how fine you are in your way,
And the sea she will sigh but she'll never deny,
For it's really too hard for the fly Well I wake up in the morning
Look at my clock
It's way past noon time
Now I'm late for work. Tell me, tell me
What have I done wrong?
Ain't nothing go right with me
Must be I've been smoking too long. Well I go to find me some breakfast
But I ain't got no food
Take me a shower
But the water don't feel no good. Tell me Tell Me I've got opium in my chimney
No other life to choose
Nightmare made of hash dreams.
Got the devil in my shoes Tell me Tell me Well when I'm smoking
Put my worries on a shelf
Don't think about nothin
Try not to see myself. Tell me Tell me Well in this blues I'm singin
There's a lesson to be learned
Don't go around smokin
Unless you want to get burned. Tell me Tell me, Nick Drake
Family Tree
Tomorrow Is A Long Time
If today were not an endless highway
If tonight were not a crooked trail
If tomorrow weren't such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all
And only if my own true love were waiting for me
And if I could hear her heart softly pounding
If only she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again
I can't see my reflection in the water
Can't speak the sounds that show no pain
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
Can't remember the sound of my own name
And only if my own true love were waiting for me
And if I could hear he heart softly pounding
If only she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again
There's beauty in the silver, singing river
There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky
None of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes
And only if my own true love were waiting for me
And if I could hear he heart softly pounding
If only she was lying by me
And she could lie in my bed once again If you see some picture of us
Lying on the bed
Some old memory haunts you
Gets stuck inside your head
Don't get angry about it
And wish we'd never been
Don't get roped into a corner
And try changing everything
Don't get paralyzed with fear
And stand there wondering
What to do
Just forget it girl
And I will too If you're on our corner
And you run into our friends
If they ask about me
Start wondering where I am
Don't get angry about it
Feel like you're caving in
Don't start crying again
And go and tell them everything
Don't you walk away believing
You will never make it through
Just forget it girl
And I will too If some rainy afternoon
You're crying in your bed
Cursing every detail
Bout the day that we first met
Don't get angry about it
Start throwing everything
Don't get struck dumb in your steps
Each time you hear the doorbell ring
Take some comfort in knowing
These are things that I will do
I can't forget it girl
Though I try to
I can't forget it girl
Though I try to Seems the time is near for finding a place outside
Seems the time is here for holding the window wide
So I'm going to try
To open up one eye
But if the world is too wide
I'll be home to hide
Keep it warm inside, if it's strange, outside. Seems the time has flown, when we lived inside a cloud
Seems the time has gone, when nothing we said was out loud
Going to find a word
Make myself be heard
But if the world is too loud
I'll be home from the crowd
Keep it soft inside, if it's strange, outside. Seems the time has come for banging our feet to the ground
Seems the time has come to see if the world is round
Sweep the smoke away
Reach the earth today
But if the world is all wrong
I won't be staying long
Keep it cool inside, if it's strange, outside. And now you know my name
But I don't feel the same
But I ain't gonna blame
The rider on the wheel. You know my song is new
You know it's new for you
I tell you how it's true
For the rider on the wheel. And round and round we go
We take it fast and slow
I must keep up a show
For the rider on the wheel
For the rider on the wheel. And now you know my name
But I don't feel the same
But I ain't gonna blame
The rider on the wheel
The rider on the wheel. Instrumental Well it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter anyhow
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm travelling on
Don't think twice it's all right Well it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
Light I've never known
Ain't no use in turning on the light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Wish there was something you could do or say
Something to make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
Don't think twice, it's all right And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
Like you've never done before
It ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
I can't hear you anymore
I'm thinking and a wondering, walking down that road
I once loved a woman - A child I'm told
Gave her my heart, but she wanted my soul
Don't think twice, it's all right So long, honey-babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
Goodbye is too good a word babe
I'll just say, Fare thee well 
I ain't saying you treated me unkind
You could've done better, but I don't mind
You just kind of wasted my precious time
Don't think twice, it's all right Black eyed dog he called at my door
The black eyed dog he called for more
A black eyed dog he knew my name
A black eyed dog he knew my name
A black eyed dog
A black eyed dog
I'm growing old and I wanna go home, I'm growing old and I dont wanna know
I'm growing old and I wanna go home
Black eyed dog he called at my door
The black eyed dog he called for more Do you curse where you come from,
Do you swear in the night
Will it mean much to you
If I treat you right.
Do you like what you're doing,
Would you do it some more
Or will you stop once and wonder
What you're doing it for.
Hey slow Jane, make sense
Slow, slow, Jane, cross the fence. Do you feel like a remnant
Of something that's past
Do you find things are moving
Just a little too fast.
Do you hope to find new ways
Of quenching your thirst,
Do you hope to find new ways
Of doing better than your worst.
Hey slow Jane, let me prove
Slow, slow Jane, we're on the move. Do it for you,
Sure that you would do the same for me one day.
So try to be true,
Even if it's only in your hazey way. Can you tell if you're moving
With no mirror to see,
If you're just riding a new man
Looks a little like me.
Is it all so confusing,
Is it hard to believe
When the winter is coming
Can you sign up and leave.
Hey slow Jane, live your lie
Slow, slow jane, fly on by. And what will happen in the morning when the
world it gets so crowded that you can't look out
the window in the morning And what will happen in the evening in the forest
with the weasel with the teeth that bite so sharp
when you're not looking in the evening And all the friends that you once knew are left
behind they kept you safe and so secure amongst
the books and all the records of your lifetime What will happen
In the morning
When the world it gets so crowded that you can't
look out the window in the morning Hey, take a little while to grow your brothers hair
And now, take a little while to make your sister fair
And now that the family
Is part of a chain
Take off your eyeshade
Start over again Now take a little while to find your way in here
Now take a little while to make your story clear
Now that you're lifting
Your feet from the ground
Weigh up your anchor
And never look round Let's sing a song
For Hazey Jane
She's back again in my mind
If songs were lines
In a conversation
The situation would be fine A city freeze
Get on your knees
Pray for warmth and green paper.
A city drought
You're down and out
See your trousers don't taper.
Saddle up
Kick your feet
Ride the range of a London street
Travel to a local plane
Turn around and come back again. And at the chime of the city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armour down. Stay indoors
Beneath the floors
Talk with neighbours only.
The games you play
Make people say
You're either weird or lonely.
A city star
Won't shine too far
On account of the way you are
And the beads
Around your face
Make you sure to fit back in place. And at the beat of the city drum
See how your friends come in twos;
Or threes or more.
For the sound of a busy place
Is fine for a pretty face
Who knows what a face is for. The city clown
Will soon fall down
Without a face to hide in.
And he will lose
If he won't choose
The one he may confide in.
Sonny boy
With smokes for sale
Went to ground with a face so pale
And never heard
About the change
Showed his hand and fell out of range. In the light of a city square
Find out the face that's fair
Keep it by your side.
When the light of the city falls
You fly to the city walls
Take off with your bride. But at the chime of a city clock
Put up your road block
Hang on to your crown.
For a stone in a tin can
Is wealth to the city man
Who leaves his armour down. You have never tried
To conceal or deny
That this love is my ruin
My peril and trial
All of the promises were nothing but lies
But now that you're here
Why don't you stay for a while Most of my friends
Fell under your spell
Some fell into heaven
But most fell back in to hell
The beauty forgotten
Like the snow-covered crops in the field
Where the wind knows no mercy
And she howls and she reels But I'm tired of pretending
Yes I'm tired of pretending
That I still care
I still care And the smoke curls like a river
To some forgotten land
Floating abandoned the mystery concealed
Like the moonlit shadows
On a snow-covered field
Where the wind knows no mercy
And she howls
And she reels But I'm tired of pretending
Yes I'm tired of pretending
That I still care
I still care I don't know much about love
How it cures and frees the soul
Makes you whole and all that other stuff
But I was kissed by lady luck
And I know that I'm stuck on you
Yes I know that I'm stuck on you Sometimes it gets so very hard
It's like we're trying to tear each other apart
With every scar a deeper love revealed
Now there's nothing left to conceal
No there's nothing left to conceal With every turn it's like we hit a wall
Do you see it the same way
And I don't want to complicate it
But I hate this place
And there's only so much that I can take
Before this glass heart breaks And I know I've got to let you go
You were gone so long
And I didn't even know
It's just that I love you so
And I know that I'm stuck on you
Yes I know that I'm stuck on you As he sat down upon the train
Silence settled in his brain
He reached out his hand
And touched her hair
He struggled with the
Same old though
Should he tell her
Should he not
He felt her presence
Everywhere Whatever comes between us
Don't let it stand in your way
This is what he'd come
Here to say She just smiled
And read a book
Gave him such a
Gentle look
He felt a pain right
Through his chest
He pictured back to
When they met
Open door on a movie set
Her brown eyes took
His breath And every word she
Spoke to him
Went like a bullet to his
Heart
That's what he remembers
From the start Now they're off
Searching in vain
Out of control
Just like a runaway train
Can't see that it's
Not up to them
Soon just like a river
They'll be rack home again He sat up through
The hours it takes
Passing through the
Northern lakes
Til the sleeping giant was in his sight
He knew that she'd been drifting some
Wondered where his
Faith had gone
He stayed awake most
Of the night
Whatever makes you happy
I won't stand in your way
Words you hope you never
Have to say Now they're off
Searching in vain
Out of control
Just like a runaway train
Can't see that it's
Not up to them
Soon just like a river
They'll be rack home again She watched him toss
And try to sleep
Struggle with his
Demons deep
She thought of all
That they'd been through
Imagining her life alone
No where he was
That was home
She wondered if he knew That every word
He spoke to her
Went like a bullet
To her heart
That's the way it's
Been right from
The start Now they're off
Searching in vain
Out of control
Just like a runaway train
Can't see that it's
Not up to them
Soon just like a river
They'll be rack home again Well I wake up in the morning
Look at my clock
It's way past noon time
Now I'm late for work. Tell me, tell me
What have I done wrong?
Ain't nothing go right with me
Must be I've been smoking too long. Well I go to find me some breakfast
But I ain't got no food
Take me a shower
But the water don't feel no good. Tell me Tell Me I've got opium in my chimney
No other life to choose
Nightmare made of hash dreams.
Got the devil in my shoes Tell me Tell me Well when I'm smoking
Put my worries on a shelf
Don't think about nothin
Try not to see myself. Tell me Tell me Well in this blues I'm singin
There's a lesson to be learned
Don't go around smokin
Unless you want to get burned. Tell me Tell me, I got my plans
From trembling hands
I knew just what to do
Follow each step carefully
And hope they pulled me through
My father ran
To different lands
And not a word we spoke
But I was here
To conquer fear
And bring some glory home There's a world of hate and sorrow
Out there standing in your way
There's a load of compromise
Before you die
And each time you step forward you get burned a little bit
No longer know the way
To say goodbye
Now I'm down here underneath
Your bedroom light
Rena please come out
With me tonight I look in through
The window
And I though I'd take
My chance
I taught myself to play
So I could be where people danced
No higher call
Than stars that fall
I waited patiently
A thousand miles of pavement
That became my destiny You can wait a lonely lifetime
Wondering when it's gonna come
You can while away the hours
Getting stoned
But one day you get lucky
And you look in someone's eyes
That tell you you don't
Have to be alone
Now I'm falling back
Just out of your sight
Rena please come out
With me tonight Oh now I know the way things go
And what I put you through
Cause when they try to get to me
They get to me through you I know it's not the kind of hurt
That's easily set right
And I know you got your reasons
To stay inside
But nothing ever happens
When it's left out on it's own
You locked in there with
Just your wounded pride
I'm down here and I'm
Way too tired to fight
Rena please come out
With me tonight
Rena please come out
With me tonight I was walking thru the forest
One cold and dreary morn
My heart sick with jealousy
And memories I need no more
No I could never kill a man
But I would do him harm
Knowing that you're there
Lying in his arms
My flesh was ripped and torn
By the bramble and the thorn
I was lost but well-prepared
To offer up my soul
Because the greater misery
Is to live with what I know
The moon concealed by April's storm
No bearing I could find
Until I fell into a clearing
And a road I recognized
I was far
Far from my home
Further from her smile
Not sure if I would return
Or just lay down and die
As I stood in Phaedra's Meadow
Well the dawn did break the sky
And from the highest up in heaven
The Weaving Star fell into my eyes Who wouldn't do anything
That you want them to
Carry the world right to your feet
If that's what you want me to do
Didn't we laugh
And scream and shout
Didn't we wait
Til it all worked out I know it's late
And I should wait until the morning comes
But I got a fear that wakes me up
And I don't know where the fear comes from Didn't I bring you
What I could bring
Didn't I tell you
Everything
Well I will
Well I will Some people talk about us
Said we'd never get this far
Let it all rain around us
You know the way things are Fifteen miles from hope
Another town another week goes by
I'm fading away here like the birds
That disappear into the sky Wouldn't I be there
When you call
I pick you up
When you start to fall Well I will
Well I will
Well I will
Well I will As we drove on through the Finger Lakes
Water shining at our side
I was wrestling the demons in my mind
But it seemed to me you were reaching for
Some places we'd never been
Where we'd leave the past
On some dark road behind I will always come
If you need me
And I will never forget
The things you said
And in my hour of darkness
You will come to me
And I will raise up
My worried head There's a line between what might have been
And where we stand today
There are roads we both know
We can never cross
But a voice comes down from history
And whispers in my ear
Don't waste the time
The time that isn't lost I will always come
If you need me
And I will never forget
The things you said
And in my hour of darkness
You will come to me
And I will raise up
My worried head I have walked by so many rooms
And watched you brooding in the dark
I spent my youth moving round you
Like a ghost
But the years go by
And the reasons die
That kept us far apart
Now the sun coming up each day's
What we need most I will always come
If you need me
And I will never forget
The things you said
And in my hour of darkness
You will come to me
And I will raise up
My worried head Bird flew by
And wondered, wondered why
She was white
And ought to stay up in the sky
From the air she could wonder
For the reason
What's the point of a year
Or a season Your life flies away
As the night turns to day
If you start once to think
Your hair will soon turn grey
But one would like to wonder
For the reason
What's the point of a year
Or a season The list of fallen stars
And crumbled, broken hearts
Comes from a need
To play so many parts
But one would like to wonder
For the reason
What's the point of a year
Or a season The wind and the rain
Shook hands again
Untouched by the world
They managed to keep sane
They were able to wonder
For the reason
What's the point of a year
Or a season Bird flew by
And wondered, wondered why
She was white
And ought to stay up in the sky
From the air she could wonder
For the reason
What's the point of a year
Or a season I could have done better things
If someone shut my mouth
Or somebody clipped my wings
So many wasted evenings
Talking the same sweet talk
Always the last ones leaving
Waking up when fortunes knock I've no regrets no I couldn't think of one
We both kept the road
The road that we stumbled on
You and me walking home
Fighting the morning light
Just making our way through days
But making out like thieves at night I can't help wondering
Can't help wondering why
I can't help wondering
Can't help wondering why Sometimes you wake up screaming
All my life I must be dreaming
I've been wrong
And I'm not strong
But I'll be the one that keeps rolling on Born to this generation
Never made to wait
Looking like fools sometimes
A couple of blind men at the gate I can't help wondering
Can't help wondering why
I can't help wondering
Can't help wondering why A crowded room on Beverley
A party for the rent
You were sitting casually
With a few of your fabulous friends
I asked you what your name was
But you just turned and laughed
Then a little later
I finally caught your eye
And even though you tried so hard
You couldn't hide your smile
I followed you downstairs
And we talked for a long long time Would you call that love
Who's to say
I don't know much about love
But you're the best I ever had It wasn't long before you changed
Your phone number to mine
You said that you were movin in
But you needed a little time
So I kept all your messages
Til you made up your mind
Now the rain is fallin and the clouds are gathering
And the sun refuse to shine
Your promises and whispered words
Are forever on my mind
And I'm left here smokin cigarettes
That you left behind Would you call that love
Who's to say
I don't know much about love
But you're the best I ever had Are you ready? Ready to cry
Are you ready? Ready to cry
This is the saddest story we all know why
So cry cry cry Are you ready? Ready to leave
This life we love
You know what I mean
No more whiskey, no more cigarettes And your last breath just like a sunset
You know I love your old bones
I love your story but youre going home
Are you ready? Are you ready? Ready to die
Are you ready? Ready to die
Is there anything I can do
Cause saying goodbye to you Will be the hardest thing I ever do
Dont worry buddy well see this thing through
Ill cry the river that carries you through
Are you ready? It's so easy to fall in love with you
I know I did for a day or two
You never noticed lost in your crowd
Just no room for me up on that cloud Can't find no changes
For better in my luck
Empty are my eyes and my heart
Cold grey days
The nights are so long
My heart is sinking
Bound to a stone This old world is a bag of tricks
A whole lot of nothin
Where nothin ever fits
In all her glory she just don't compare
To one single tear
In your beautiful eyes Thank you December
For your cold grey air
Lakes are frozen, trees are bare
I once loved her
Of that I am proud
Just no room for me
Up on that cloud Tramp moves on to the end of the street
I listen to the echo of his hobnail feet
For some there's a future to find
But I think they're leaving me behind The world hurries on at its breakneck pace
People fly by in their lifelong race
For them there's a future to find
And I think they're leaving me behind The chances, they come but the chances have been lost
Success can be gained, but at too great a cost
For some there's a future to find
But I think they're leaving me behind The wind sweeps up and goes back to its tree
The rain flows by and moves on to the sea
For them there's a future to find
But I think they're leaving me behind Poor mum
Poor mum
After a lifetime of dreaming
Poor mum
Poor mum
Whatever became of your scheming
Nothing worked out in the way that you planned
Nothing was quite as you thought
Try very hard not to misunderstand
Joy as it flies cannot be caught
Poor mum
Poor mum
Where did you take a wrong turning
Poor mum
Poor mum
Pack up that last little yearning
Pack it away with the books and the toys
Silent and bound
Silent and mend
Go out and grab at you life and forget
You are poor, poor mum It in a bright red sky
In the heat of an evening
When only prisoners sleep
She said she couldn't
Come to the garden
See an old man weep
She said her dreams were too far to be thought of
Her scars too wide to heal
She said she couldn't come to the garden
See a blind man kneel
She sailed away to a blue horizon
In floating thoughts she'd sway
She said she couldn't come to the garden
See an old man pray
She wished them luck as they left on their journey
Maybe she'd join them soon
But she lost her grin at the tip of life's fingers
Went home and worshiped the moon Strolling down the highway
I`m gonna get there my way
Just keep on down-a-walking
You hear my guitar-a-rocking
Well I stroll on down
On down the highway People think I'm a crazing
Lord above they're lazing
Sunshine's all day long
The garlic's far too strong
Well I stroll on down
On down the highway Cars won't stop for no one
But don't you think that you're just rolling down
I think you are a spy
shoot them as they go by
Well, no cars no cars
Won't stop for no one Strolling down the highway
I'm gonna get there my way
Just keep on down-a-walking
You hear my guitar-a-rocking
Well I stroll on down
On down the highway Black days of winter all were through
The blossoms came and they brought you
Clouds left the sky
And I knew the reason why
They made way for you and the blossom. The seasons cycle turned again
An april shower now and then
Trees came alive
And the bees left their hive
They came out to see you and the blossom. People were laughing, smiling with the sun
They knew that summer had begun. The nights grew warm, the days grew long
Spring turned to summer and was gone
It seemed so fine
All the cider and the wine
But I knew you'd go with the blossom. When spring returns I'll look again
To find another blossom friend
Until I do
Find something new
I'll just think of you and the blossom. The tramp moves on to the end of the street
I listen to the echo of his hobnail feet
For some there's a future to find
But I think they're leaving me behind. The world humes on at its breakneck pace
People fly in their lifelong race
For them there's a future to find
But I think they're leaving me behind. The chances they come, but the chances have been lost
Success can be gained, but at too great a cost
For some there's a future to find
But I think they're leaving me behind. The wind sweeps up and goes back to its tree
The rain flows by and moves on to the sea
For them there's a future to find
But I think they're leaving me behind. Winter is gone
And the leaves are green
Winter is gone
And the leaves turn green
Your innocent face
So you never had seen Come on, my love
And pay the world
Come on, my love
And pay the world
You cheated me
But I wish you well Rope is bought
And the bough is swung
Rope is bought
And the bough is swung
An innocent man
This day will be hung Come on, my love
And see me die
Come on, my love
And see me die
See me dancing
Dance beneath the sky
Neath those gallows high
Come on and see me die Winter is gone
And the leaves are green
Winter is gone
And the leaves turn green
Your innocent face
So I wish I'd never had seen Yes, mama - yes, girl
Hear me calling you
So sweet, so sweet
My sugar's so sweet My baby don't you go
Aint seen my little sugar come home
So sweet, so sweet
My sugar's so sweet But my baby she'd long gone
But I've seen her - I must've been doing her wrong
So sweet, so sweet
My sugar's so sweet See my baby, don't act so smart
I'll cut out your liver, and eat your heart
So sweet, so sweet
My sugar's so sweet Yes, mama - yes, girl
Hear me calling you
So sweet, so sweet
My sugar's so sweet If you leave me, pretty mama
Better not treat me right
Just have to forget you
After tomorrow night If you leave me, pretty mama
Better take your picture too
Don't want to remember
What a good looking girl can do Don't send me no letter
Don't write me no postcard
Thinking about you, baby
Makes it twice as hard If you leave me, pretty mama
Better not treat me right
Just have to forget you
After tomorrow night Well i`m sitting here
On the sudden
Watching the trees go by
My baby aint at the depot,
Gonna lay me down and cry If you leave me, pretty mama
Better not treat me right
Just have to forget you
After tomorrow night Love is but the song we sing
Fear the way we die
It can make the mountains ring
Make the angels cry
So the bird is on the wind
You may not know why Hey people now, smile on your brother
Let me see you get together
And love one another Some may come and some may go
We will surely pass
Will the one who left us here
Return for us at last?
We are but a moment's sunlight
Fading in the grass Hey people now, smile on your brother
Let me see you get together
And love one another If you hear the song I'm singing
You will understand
You hold the key to love and fear
All in your trembling hand
Just one key unlocks them both
It's at your command
Hey people now, smile on your brother
Let me see you get together
And love one another Yes, mama - yes, girl
Hear me calling you
So sweet, so sweet
My sugar's so sweet My baby don't you go
Aint seen my little sugar come home
So sweet, so sweet
My sugar's so sweet But my baby she'd long gone
But I've seen her - I must've been doing her wrong
So sweet, so sweet
My sugar's so sweet See my baby, don't act so smart
I'll cut out your liver, and eat your heart
So sweet, so sweet
My sugar's so sweet Yes, mama - yes, girl
Hear me calling you
So sweet, so sweet
My sugar's so sweet Mayfair strange in the morning light,
Mayfair strange in the summer night,
Mayfair strangest in the afternoon.
Mayfair stretching far above,
full of fame but lacking love,
Could it be we see the Mayfair moon? Mayfair strange across the park,
In the day or in the dark,
There's no need to walk or even run.
Mayfair faces clean and nice,
But beauty here is cold as ice,
Could it be we see the Mayfair sun? Mayfair strange at every hour,
Hidden frowns with mystic power,
Starry heights and golden throne,
Down below you're on you're own. Mayfair strange for passers-by,
Sights of wonder for the eye,
Could it be they'll pass by again?
Mayfair calling far and near,
For even trees are wealthy here,
Could it be we hear the Mayfair rain?
Mayfair strange in the morning light,
Mayfair strange in the summer night,
Mayfair strangest in the afternoon.
Mayfair stretching far above,
full of fame but lacking love,
Could it be we see the Mayfair moon? 

They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique
and a swinging hot spot
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got Till it's gone
They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot
They took all the trees
And put them in a tree museum
And they charged the people
A dollar and a half just to see em Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got
Till it's gone
They paved paradise
And they put up a parking lot
Hey farmer farmer
Put away that D.D.T. now Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees
Please!
Dont it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got
Till it's gone They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot
Late last night
I heard the screen door slam And a big yellow taxi
Took away my old man Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got
Till it's gone
They paved paradise
And put up a parking lot
I said don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you've got till its gone
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot Just before our love got lost you said,
I am as constant as a northern star
And I said, Constantly in the darkness,
Where's that at?
If you want me I'll be in the bar. On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh, Canada
With your face sketched on it twice. Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
And I would still be on my feet
Oh, I would still be on my feet Oh, I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints.
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid. I remember that time you told me
You said, Love is touching souls. 
Surely you touched mine.
Cause part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time. Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet.
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
And still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds.
And she said, Go to him, stay with him if you can
but be prepared to bleed. Oh, but you are in my blood
You're my holy wine
You're so bitter
bitter and so sweet.
Oh, I could drink a case of you darling
still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet Yesterday a child came out to wonder
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
And tearful at the falling of a star
Then the child moved ten times round the seasons
Skated over ten clear frozen streams
Words like, when you're older, must appease him
And promises of someday make his dreams
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and dawn
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we con only look behind
From where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game.
Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
Cartwheels turn to car wheels thru the town
And they tell him,
Take your time, it won't be long now
Till you drag your feet to slow the circles down
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and dawn
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look behind
From where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game
So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur
Coming true
There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty
Before the last revolving year is through.
And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time

In the circle game It's coming on Christmas, they're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer and singing songs of joy and peace
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on But it don't snow here, it stays pretty green
I'm gonna make a lot of money, then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene
I wish I had a river I could skate away on I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on I made my baby cry He tried hard to help me, you know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty, made me weak in the knees
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on But I'm so hard to handle, I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby that I ever had
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on I made my baby say goodbye It's coming on Christmas, they're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer, singing songs of joy and peace
I wish I had a river I could skate away on Blue, songs are like tattoos
You know I've been to sea before
Crown and anchor me
Or let me sail away
Hey Blue, there's a song for you
Ink on a pin
Underneath the skin
An empty space to fill in
Well there're so many sinking now
You've got to keep thinking
You can make it thru these waves
Acid, booze, and ass
Needles, guns, and grass
Lots of laughs, lots of laughs
Everybody's saying that hell's the hippest way to go
Well I don't think so
But I'm gonna take a look around it though
Blue, I love you Blue, here is a shell for you
Inside you'll hear a sigh
A foggy lullaby
There is your song from me The wind is in from africa
last night i couldn't sleep
oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here carey
but it's really not my home
my fingernails are filthy, i got beach tar on my feet
and i miss my clean white linen and my fancy french cologne
Oh carey get out your cane
and i'll put on some silver
oh you're a mean old daddy, but i like you fine
Come on down to the mermaid cafe and i will buy you a bottle of wine
and we'll laugh and toast to nothing and smash our empty glasses down
let's have a round for these freaks and these soldiers
a round for these friends of mine
let's have another round for the bright red devil
who keeps me in this tourist town
Come on, carey, get out your cane
i'll put on some silver
oh you're a mean old daddy, but i like you
Maybe i'll go to amsterdam
or maybe i'll go to rome
and rent me a grand piano and put some flowers round my room
but let's not talk about fare-thee-welis now
the night is a starry dome.
and they're playin that scratchy rock and roll
beneath the matalla moon
Come on, carey, get out your cane
and i'll put on some silver
you're a mean old daddy, but i like you
The wind is in from africa
last night i couldn't sleep
oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here
but, it's really not my home
maybe it's been too long a time
since i was scramblin down in the street
now they got me used to that clean white linen
and that fancy french cologne
Oh carey, get out your cane
i'll put on my finest silver
we'll go to the mermaid cafe
have fun tonight
i said, oh, you're a mean old daddy, but you're out of sight FREE MAN IN PARIS
Joni Mitchell The way I see it, he said
 You just can't win it,
Everybody's in it for their own gain
You can't please em all
There's always somebody calling you down
I do my best
And I do good business
There's a lot of people asking for my time
They're trying to get ahead
They're trying to be a good friend of mine
I was a free man in Paris
I felt unfettered and alive
There was nobody calling me up for favors
And no one's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
But for the work I've taken on
Stoking the star maker machinery
Behind the popular song
I deal in dreamers
And telephone screamers
Lately I wonder what I do it for
If i had my way
I'd just walk out those doors
And wander
Down the Champs Elysees
Going cafe to cabaret
Thinking how I'll feel when I find
That very good friend of mine
I was a free man in Paris
I felt unfettered and alive
Nobody was calling me up for favors
No one's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
But for the work I've taken on
Stoking the star maker machinery
Behind the popular song. Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and
the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window, and the
traffic wrote the words
It came ringing up like Christmas bells,
and rapping up like pipes and drums Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll wear it till the night comes Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and
the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtain, and
a rainbow on the wall
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome
you, crimson crystal beads to beckon Oh, won't you stay,
We'll put on the day
There's a sun show every second Now the curtain opens on a
portait of today
And the streets are paved with passerby
And pigeons fly
And papers lie
Waiting to blow away Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and
the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey and a
bowl of oranges, too
And the sun poured in like butterscotch
and stuck to all my senses Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll talk in present tenses When the curtain closes and the
rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By candlelight
By jewel-light
If only you will stay
Pretty baby, won't you
Wake up, it's a Chelsea morning Help me
I think I'm falling
In love again
When I get that crazy feeling
I know I'm in trouble again
I'm in trouble
Cause you're a rambler and a gambler
And a sweet talking ladies man
And you love your lovin
But not like you love your freedom Help me
I think I'm falling
In love too fast
It's got me hoping for the future
And worrying about the past
Cause I've seen some hot, hot blazes
Come down to smoke and ash
We love our lovin
But not like we love our freedom Didn't it feel good
We were sitting there talking
Or lying there not talking
Didn't it feel good
You dance with the lady
With the hole in her stocking
Didn't it feel good
Didn't it feel good Help me
I think I'm falling
In love with you
Are you going to let me go there by myself
That's such a lonely thing to do
Both of us flirting around
Flirting and flirting
Hurting too
We love our lovin
But not like we love our freedom There's a man who's been out sailing,
in a decade full of dreams.
And he takes her to a schooner,
and he treats her like a queen.
Bearing beads from California,
with their amber stones and green.
He has called her from the harbor,
he has kissed her with his freedom,
he has heard her off to starboard
in the breaking and the breathing of the water weeds. While she was busy being free. There's a man who's climbed a mountain,
and he's calling out her name,
and he hopes her heart can hear,
3, 000 miles he calls again,
he can think her there beside him,
he can miss her just the same.
He has missed her in the forest,
while he showed her all the flowers,
and the branches sang the chorus,
as he climbed the scaly towers of a forest tree. While she was somewhere being free. There's a man who sent a letter and he's waiting for her reply.
He has asked her of her travels since the day they said goodbye.
He writes, Wish you were beside me, we could make it if we try. 
He has seen her at the office, with her name on all his papers,
through the sharing of the profits,
he will find it hard to shake her from these memories. And she's so busy being free. There's a lady, in the city, and she thinks she loves them all.
There's the one who's thinking of her,
There's the one who sometimes calls.
There's the one who writes her letters,
with his facts and figures scrawl.
She has brought them to her senses,
they have laughed inside her laughter.
Now she rallies her defenses,
for she fears that one will ask her for eternity. And she's so busy being free. There's a man who sends her medals,
he is bleeding from the war.
There's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store.
There's a drummer, and a dreamer,
and you know there may be more .
She will love them when she sees them,
they will lose her if they follow.
And she only means to please them,
and her heart is full and hollow like a cactus tree. While she's so busy being free. Like a cactus tree,
Being free. No regrets coyote
we just come from such different sets of circumstance
i'm up all night in the studios
and you're up early on your ranch
you'll be brushing out a brood mare's tail
while the sun is ascending
and i'll just be getting home with my reel to reel,
there's no comprehending
just how close to the bone and the skin and the eyes
and the lips you can get
and still feel so alone
and still feel related
like stations in some relay
you're not a hit and run driver, no, no
racing away
you just picked up a hitcher
a prisoner of the white lines on the freeway
We saw a farmhouse burning down
in the middle of nowhere
in the middle of the night
and we rolled right past that tragedy
till we turned into some road house lights
where a local band was playing
locals were up kicking and shaking on the floor
and the next thing i know
that coyote's at my door
he pins me in a corner and he won't take no! 
he drags me out on the dance floor
and we're dancing close and slow
now he's got a woman at home
he's got another woman down the hall
he seems to want me anyway
why'd you have to get so drunk
and lead me on that way
you just picked up a hitcher
a prisoner of the white lines of the freeway
I looked a coyote right in the face
on the road to baljennie near my old home town
he went running thru the whisker wheat
chasing some prize down
and a hawk was playing with him
coyote was jumping straight up and making passes
he had those same eyes - just like yours
under your dark glasses
privately probing the public rooms
and peeking thru keyholes in numbered doors
where the players lick their wounds
and take their temporary lovers
and their pills and powders to get them thru this passion play
No regrets, coyote
i just get off up aways
you just picked up a hitcher
a prisoner of the white lines on the freeway
Coyote's in the coffee shop
he's staring a hole in his scrambled eggs
he picks up my scent on his fingers
while he's watching the waitresses legs
he's too fat from the bay of fundy
from appaloosas and eagles and tides
and the air conditioned cubicles
and the carbon ribbon rides
are spelling it out so clear
either he's going to have to stand and fight
or take off out of here
i tried to run away myself
to run away and wrestle with my ego
and with this flame
you put here in this eskimo
in this hitcher
in this prisoner
of the fine white lines
of the white lines on the free, free way Sitting in a park in Paris France
Reading the news and it sure looks bad
They won't give peace a chance
That was just a dream some of us had
Still a lot of lands to see
But I wouldn't want to stay here
It's too old and cold and settled in its ways here
Oh but California California I'm coming home
I'm going to see the folks I dig
I'll even kiss a Sunset pig
California I'm coming home I met a redneck on a Grecian isle
Who did the goat dance very well
He gave me back my smile
But he kept my camera to sell
Oh the rogue the red red rogue
He cooked good omelettes and stews
And I might have stayed on with him there
But my heart cried out for you California Oh California I'm coming home
Oh make me feel good rock n roll band
I'm your biggest fan
California I'm coming home Oh it gets so lonely
When you're walking
And the streets are full of strangers
All the news of home you read
Just gives you the blues
Just gives you the blues
So I bought me a ticket
I caught a plane to Spain
Went to a party down a red dirt road
There were lots of pretty people there
Reading Rolling Stone reading Vogue
They said How long can you hang around? 
I said a week maybe two
Just until my skin turns brown
Then I'm going home to California California I'm coming home
Oh will you take me as I am
Strung out on another man
California I'm coming home Oh it gets so lonely
When you're walking
And the streets are full of strangers
All the news of home you read
More about the war
And the bloody changes
Oh will you take me as I am?
Will you take me as I am?
Will you? I'm traveling in some vehicle
i'm sitting in some cafe
a defector from the petty wars
that shell shock love away
there's comfort in melancholy
when there's no need to explain
it's just as natural as the weather
in this moody sky today
in our possessive coupling
so much could not be expressed
so now i'm returning to myself
these things that you and i suppressed
i see something of myself in everyone
just at this moment of the world
as snow gathers like bolts of lace
waltzing on a ballroom girl
You know it never has been easy
whether you do or you do not resign
whether you travel the breadth of extremities
or stick to some straighter line
now here's a man and a woman sitting on a rock
they're either going to thaw out or freeze
listen,
strains of benny goodman
coming thru the snow and the pinewood trees
i'm porous with travel fever
but you know i'm so glad to be on my own
still somehow the slightest touch of a stranger
can set up trembling in my bones
i know - no one's going to show me everything
we all come and go unknown
each so deep and superficial
between the forceps and the stone
Well i looked at the granite markers
those tribute to finality - to eternity
and then i looked at myself here
chicken scratching for my immortality
in the church they light the candles
and the wax rolls down like tears
there's the hope and the hopelessness
i've witnessed thirty years
we're only particles of change i know, i know
orbiting around the sun
but how can i have that point of view
when i'm always bound and tied to someone
white flags of winter chimneys
waving truce against the moon
in the mirrors of a modern bank
from the window of a hotel room
I'm traveling in some vehicle
i'm sitting in some cafe
a defector from the petty wars
until love sucks me back that way Everything comes and goes
marked by lovers and styles of clothes
things that you held high
and told yourself were true
lost or changing as the days come down to you
down to you
constant stranger
you're a kind person
you're a cold person too
it's down to you
it all comes down to you.
you go down to the pick up station
craving warmth and beauty
you settle for less than fascination
a few drinks later you're not so choosy
when the closing lights strip off the shadows
on this strange new flesh you've found
clutching the night to you like a fig leaf
you hurry
to the blackness
and the blankets
to lay down an impression
and your loneliness
In the morning there are lovers in the street
they look so high
you brush against a stranger
and you both apologize
old friends seem indifferent
you must have brought that on
old bonds have broken down
love is gone
ooh, love is gone
written on your spirit this sad song
love is gone
Everything comes and goes
pleasure moves on too early
and trouble leaves too slow
just when you're thinking
you've finally got it made
bad news comes knocking
at your garden gate
knocking for you
constant stranger
you're a brute-you're an angel
you can crawl-you can fly too
it's down to you
it all comes down to you I am on a lonely road and
I am traveling, traveling, traveling, traveling
Looking for something, what can it be
Oh I hate you some, I hate you some, I love you some
Oh I love you when I forget about me
I wanna be strong I wanna laugh along
I wanna belong to the living
Alive, alive, I want to get up and jive
I want to wreck my stockings in some jukebox dive
Do you want, do you want, do you wanna dance with me baby
Do you wanna take a chance on
Maybe finding some sweet romance with me baby, well come on All I really really want is our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you too
All I really really want our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you
I wanna talk to you, I wanna shampoo you
I wanna renew you again and again
Applause, applause, life is our cause
When I think of your kisses my mind see-saws
Do you see, do you see, do you see how you hurt me baby
So I hurt you too
Then we both get so blue I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
Looking for the key to set me free
Oh the jealousy
The greed is the unraveling it's the unraveling
And it undoes all the joy that could be
I wanna fun, I wanna shine like the sun
I wanna be the one that you want to see
I wanna knit you a sweater
Wanna write you a love letter
I wanna make you feel better, I wanna
Make you feel free
Hm hm hm, hm
Wanna make you feel all free
All I wanna make you feel free Born with the moon in cancer
choose her a name she will answer to
call her green and the winters cannot fade her
call her green for the children who've made her
little green, be a gypsy dancer
He went to california
hearing that everything's warmer there
so you write him a letter and say, her eyes are blue. 
he sends you a poem and she's lost to you
little green, he's a non-conformer Just a little green
like the color when the spring is born
there'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
just a little green
like the nights when the northern lights perform
there'll be icicles and birthday clothes
and sometimes there'll be sorrow
Child with a child pretending
weary of lies you are sending home
so you sign all the papers in the family name
you're sad and you're sorry, but you're not ashamed
little green, have a happy ending Just a little green
like the color when the spring is born
there'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
just a little green
like the nights when the northern lights perform
there'll be icicles and birthday clothes
and sometimes there'll be sorrow Look out the left the captain said
the lights down there, that's where we'll land
i saw a falling star burn up
above the las vegas sands
it wasn't the one that you gave to me
that night down south between the trailers
not the early one
that you can wish upon;
not the northern one
that guides in the sailors
Oh starbright, starbright
you've got the lovin that i like, all right
turn this crazy bird around
i shouldn't have got on this flight tonight
You got the touch so gentle and sweet
but you've got that look so critical
now i can't talk to you baby
i get so weak
sometimes i think love is just mythical
up there's a heaven
down there's a town
blackness everywhere and little lights shine
oh, blackness, blackness dragging me down
come on light the candle in this poor heart of mine
Oh starbright, starbright
you've got the lovin that i like, all right
turn this crazy bird around
i shouldn't hove got on this flight tonight
I'm drinking sweet champagne
got the headphones up high
can't numb you out
can't drum you out of my mind
they're playing goodbye baby, baby goodbye,
ooh, ooh, love is blind 
up go the flaps, down go the wheels
i hope you got your heat turned on baby
i hope they finally fixed your automobile
i hope it's better when we meet again baby
Starbright, starbright
you got the lovin that i like, all right
turn this crazy bird around
i shouldn't have got on this flight tonight If there's one rule to this game

Fire and ice All the people at this party
They've got a lot of style
They've got stamps of many countries
They've got passport smiles
Some are friendly
Some are cutting
Some are watching it from the wings
Some are standing in the centre
Giving to get something Photo beauty gets attention
Then her eye paint's running down
She's got a rose in her teeth
And a lampshade crown
One minute she's so happy
Then she's crying on someone's knee
Saying laughing and crying
You know it's the same release I told you when I met you
I was crazy
Cry for us all beauty
Cry for Eddie in the corner
Thinking he's nobody
And Jack behind his joker
And stone-cold Grace behind her fan
And me in my frightened silence
Thinking I don't understand I feel like I'm sleeping
Can you wake me
You seem to have a broader sensibility
I'm just living on nerves and feelings
With a weak and a lazy mind
And coming to peoples parties
Fumbling deaf dumb and blind I wish I had more sense of humor
Keeping the sadness at bay
Throwing the lightness on these things
Laughing it all away
Laughing it alI away
Laughing it all away Last time I saw Richard was Detroit in 68
And he told me all romantics meet the same fate
Someday, cynical and drunk and boring someone
In some dark cafe
You laugh, he said you think you're immune,
Go look at eyes
They're full of moon
You like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you
All those pretty lies, pretty lies
When you gonna realize they're only pretty lies
Only pretty lies, pretty lies He put a quarter in the wurlitzer, and he pushed
Three buttons and the thing began to whirl
And a barman came by a fishnet stockings and a bow tie
And she said: drink up now it's getting on time to close 
Richard, you haven't really changed, I said
That's just now you're romanticizing some pain that's in your head
You've got tombs in your in your eyes, but the songs
You punched are dreaming
Listen, they sing of love so sweet
When you gonna get yourself back on your feet?
Oh and love can be so sweet, love so sweet Richard got married to a figure skater
And he bought her a dish washer and a coffe percolator
And he drinks at home now most night with the TV on
And all the house lights left up bright
I'm gonna blow this damn candle out
I don't want nobody comin over to my table
I've got nothing to talk to anybody about
All good dreamer pass this way someday
Hidin behind bottles in dark cafes
Dark cafes
Only a dark cocoon before
I get my gorgeous wings
And fly away
Only a phase, these dark cafe days My old man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
No, my old man
Keeping away my blues He's my sunshine in the morning
He's my fireworks at the end of the day
He's the warmest chord I ever heard
Play that warm chord, play and stay baby
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man
Keeping away my blues But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide Then he comes home
And he takes me in his loving arms
And he tells me all his troubles
And he tells me all my charms
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
No, my old man
Keeping away my blues But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide My old man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
No, my old man
Keeping away my lonesome blues Fly silly seabird
No dreams can possess you
No voices can blame you
For sun on your wings
My gentle relations
Have names they must call me
For loving the freedom
Of all flying things
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach out of cry I came to the city
And lived like old Crusoe
On an island of noise
In a cobblestone sea
And the beaches were concrete
And the stars paid a light bill
And the blossoms hung false
On their store window trees
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach out of cry Out of the city
And down to the seaside
To sun on my shoulders
And wind in my hair
But sandcastles crumble
And hunger is human
And humans are hungry
For worlds they can't share
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach out of cry I call to a seagull
Who dives to the waters
And catches his silver-fine
Dinner alone
Crying where are the footprints
That danced on these beaches
And the hands that cast wishes
That sunk like a stone
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach Out of cry When morning comes to morgantown
the merchants roll their awnings down
the milktrucks make their morning rounds
in morning, morgantown
We'll rise up early, with the sun
to ride the bus while everyone is yawning
and the day is young
in morning, morgantown
Morning morgantown
buy your dreams a dollar down
morning any town you name
morning's just the same
We'll find a table in the shade
and sip our tea and lemonade
and watch the morning on parade
in morning, morgantown
Ladies in their rainbow fashions
colored stop and go lights flashing
we'll wink at total strangers passing in
morning, morgantown
Morning morgantown
buy your dreams a dollar down
morning any town you name
morning's just the same
I'd like to buy you everything
a wooden bird with painted wings
a window full of colored rings
in morning, morgantown.
But the only thing i have to give
to make you smile, to win you with
are all the mornings still to live
in morning, morgantown I was driving across the burning desert
When I spotted six jet planes
Leaving six white vapor trails across the bleak terrain
It was the hexagram of the heavens
It was the strings of my guitar
Amelia it was just a false alarm The drone of flying engines
Is a song so wild and blue
It scrambles time and seasons if it gets thru to you
Then your life becomes a travelogue
Of picture post card charms
Amelia it was just a false alarm People will tell you where they've gone
They'll tell you where to go
But till you get there yourself you never really know
Where some have found their paradise
Others just come to harm
Oh, Amelia it was just a false alarm I wish that he was here tonight
It's so hard to obey
His sad request of me to kindly stay away
So this is how I hide the hurt
As the road leads cursed and charmed
I tell Amelia it was just a false alarm A ghost of aviation
She was swallowed by the sky
Or by the sea like me she had a dream to fly
Like Icarus ascending
On beautiful foolish arms
Amelia it was just a false alarm Maybe I've never really loved
I guess that is the truth
I've spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitudes
And looking down on everything
I crashed into his arms
Amelia it was just a false alarm I pulled into the Cactus Tree Motel
To shower off the dust
And I slept on the strange pillows of my wanderlust
I dreamed of 747s
Over geometric farms
Dreams Amelia, dreams and false alarms I came upon a child of god
he was walking along the road
and i asked him, where are you going
and this he told me
i'm going on down to yasgur's farm
i'm going to join in a rock n roll band
i'm going to camp out on the land
i'm going to try an get my soul free
we are stardust
we are golden
and we've got to get ourselves
back to the garden
Then can i walk beside you
i have come here to lose the smog
and i feel to be a cog in something turning
well maybe it is just the time of year
or maybe it's the time of man
i don't know who i am
but you know life is for learning
we are stardust
we are golden
and we've got to get ourselves
back to the garden
By the time we got to woodstock
we were half a million strong
and everywhere there was song and celebration
and i dreamed i saw the bombers
riding shotgun in the sky
and they were turning into butterflies
above our nation
we are stardust
billion year old carbon
we are golden
caught in the devil's bargain
and we've got to get ourselves
back to the garden He was sitting in the lounge of the Empire Hotel
He was drinking for diversion, he was thinking for himself
A little money riding on the Maple Leafs
Along comes a lady in lacy sleeves
She says, let me sit down, you know drinking alone's a shame, it's a shame, it's a crying shame
Look at those jokers glued to that damn hockey game
Hey honey, you've got lots of cash
Bring us down a bottle and we'll have some laughs
Gin's what I'm drinking, I was raised on robbery I'm a pretty good cook, I'm sitting on my groceries
Come up to my kitchen, I'll show you my best recipe
I try and I try but I can't save a cent
I'm up half the night cooking trying to make my rent
I'm rough but I'm pleasin, I was raised on robbery We had a little money once, they were pushing through a four lane highway
Government gave us three thousand dollars, you should have seen it fly away
First he bought a 57 Biscayne, he put it in the ditch
He drunk up all the rest, that son of a bitch
His blood's bad whiskey, I was raised on robbery You know you ain't bad looking, I like the way you hold your drinks
Come home with me honey, I ain't asking for no full-length mink
Hey, where you going, don't go yet
Your glass ain't empty and we just met
You're mean when you're loaded, I was raised on robbery there is a young man that I know comes from down in southern colorado He bought her a diamond for her throat
He put her in a ranch house on a hill
She could see the valley barbecues
From her window sill
See the blue pools in the squinting sun
Hear the hissing of summer lawns He put up a barbed wire fence
To keep out the unknown
And on every metal thorn
Just a little blood of his own
She patrols that fence of his
To a latin drum
And the hissing of summer lawns
Darkness
Wonder makes it easy
Darkness
With a joyful mask
Darkness
Tube's gone, darkness, darkness, darkness
No color no contrast A diamond dog
Carrying a cup and a cane
Looking through a double glass
Looking at too much pride and too much shame
There's a black fly buzzing
There's a heat wave burning in her master's voice
Hissing summer lawns He gave her his darkness to regret
And good reason to quit him
He gave her a roomful of Chippendale
That nobody sits in
Still she stays with a love of some kind
It's the lady's choice
The hissing of summer lawns Words and Music by
Isham Jones and Gene Willaden 1942
So here's to you
May your dreams come true
May old father time
Never be unkind
And through the years
Save your smiles and your tears
They're just souvenirs
They'll make music in your heart
Remember this
Each new day is a kiss
Sent from up above
With an angel's love
So here's to you
May your skies be blue
And your love blessed
That's my best to you Remember this
Each new day is a kiss
Sent from up above
With an angel's love
So here's to you
May your skies be blue
And your love blessed
That's my very best to you I pulled up behind a cadillac;
we were waiting for the light;
and i took a look at his license plate,
it said, just ice. 
is justice just ice?
governed by greed and lust?
just the strong doing what they can
and the weak suffering what they must?
and the gas leaks
and the oil spills
and sex sells everything
and sex kills,
sex kills,
Doctors pills give you brand new ills
and the bills bury you like an avalanche
and lawyers haven't been this popular
since robespierre slaughtered half of france!
and indian chiefs with their old beliefs know
the balance is undone-crazy ions,
you can feel it out in traffic;
everyone hates everyone!
and the gas leaks
and the oil spills
and sex sells everything
and sex kills,
sex kills,
All these jackoffs at the office
the rapist in the pool
oh and the tragedies in the nurseries,
little kids packin guns to school
the ulcerated ozone
these tumors of the skin,
this hostile sun beating down on
this massive mess we're in!
and the gas leaks
and the oil spills
and sex sells everything
and sex kills,
sex kills,
sex kills,
sex kills,
sex kills, When Charlie speaks of Lester
You know someone great has gone
The sweetest swinging music man
Had a Porkie Pig hat on
A bright star
In a dark age
When the bandstands had a thousand ways
Of refusing a black man admission
Black musician
In those days they put him in an
Underdog position
Cellars and chittlins When Lester took him a wife
Arm and arm went black and white
And some saw red
And drove them from their hotel bed
Love is never easy
It's short of the hope we have for happiness
Bright and sweet
Love is never easy street!
Now we are black and white
Embracing out in the lunatic New York night
It's very unlikely we'll be driven out of town
Or be hung in a tree
That's unlikely! Tonight these crowds
Are happy and loud
Children are up dancing in the streets
In the sticky middle of the night
Summer serenade
Of taxi horns and fun arcades
Where right or wrong
Under neon
Every feeling goes on!
For you and me
The sidewalk is a history book
And a circus
Dangerous clowns
Balancing dreadful and wonderful perceptions
They have been handed
Day by day
Generations on down We came up from the subway
On the music midnight makes
To Charlie's bass and Lester's saxophone
In taxi horns and brakes
Now Charlie's down in Mexico
With the healers
So the sidewalk leads us with music
To two little dancers
Dancing outside a black bar
There's a sign up on the awning
It says Pork Pie Hat Bar 
And there's black babies dancing,
Tonight! Papa's faith is people
mama she believes in cleaning
papa's faith is in people
mama she's always cleaning
papa brought home the sugar
mama taught me the deeper meaning
she don't like my kick pleat skirt
she don't like my eyelids painted green
she don't like me staying up late
in my high-heeled shoes
living for that rock n roll dancing scene
papa says leave the girl alone, mother
she's looking like a movie queen 
Mama thinks she spoilt me
papa knows somehow he set me free
mama thinks she spoilt me rotten
she blames herself
but papa he blesses me
it's a rough road to travel
mama let go now
it's always called for me
sometimes i get that feeling
and i want to settle
and raise a child up with somebody
i get that strong longing
and i want to settle
and raise a child up with somebody
but it passes like the summer
i'm a wild seed again
let the wind carry me I slept last night in a good hotel
i went shopping today for jewels
the wind rushed around in the dirty town
and the children let out from the schools
i was standing on a noisy corner
waiting for the walking green
across the street he stood
and he played real good
on his clarinet, for free
Now me i play for fortunes
and those velvet curtain calls
i've got a black limousine
and two gentlemen
escorting me to the halls
and i play if you have the money
or if you're a friend to me
but the one man band
by the quick lunch stand
he was playing real good, for free
Nobody stopped to hear him
though he played so sweet and high
they knew he had never
been on their t.v.
so they passed his music by
i meant to go over and ask for a song
maybe put on a harmony,
i heard his refrain
as the signal changed
he was playing real good, for free Downtown
My darling dime store thief
In the War of Independence
Rock n roll rang sweet as victory
Under neon signs
A girl was in bloom
And a woman was fading
In a suburban room
I said take me to the dance
Do you want to dance?
I love to dance
And I told him
They don't take chances
They seem so removed from romance
They've been broken in churches & schools
And molded to middle class circumstance
And we were rollin
Rollin
Rock n rollin Downtown
The dance halls and cafes
Feel so wild you could break somebody's heart
Just doing the latest dance craze
Gail and Louise
In those push up brassieres
Tight dresses and rhinestone rings
Drinking up the band's beers
Young love was kissing under bridges
Kissing in cars
Kissing in cafes
And we were walking down Main Street
Kisses like bright flags hung on holidays
In France they kiss on Main Street
Amour, mama, not cheap display
And we were rollin
Rollin
Rock n rollin Downtown
In the pinball arcade
With his head full of pool hall pitches
And songs from the hit parade
He'd be singing Bye, Bye, Love 
While he's racking up his free play
Let those rock n roll choir boys
Come and carry us away
Sometimes Chickie had the car
Or Ron had a car
Or Lead Foot Melvin with his hotwire head
We'd all go looking for a party
Looking to raise Jesus up from the dead
And I'd be kissing in the back seat
Thrilling to the Brando-like things that he said
And we'd be rollin
Rollin
Rock n rolling 
Rollin
Rollin
Rock n rollin I awoke today and found the frost
perched on the town
It hovered in a frozen sky, then it
gobbled summer down
When the sun turns traitor cold and all
the trees are shivering in a naked row I get the urge for going
But I never seem to go
I get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
Summertime is falling down and winter
is closing in I had me a man in summertime
He had summer-colored skin
And not another girl in town
My darling's heart could win
But when the leaves fell on the ground
Boy winds came around, pushed them face
down in the snow He got the urge for going
And I had to let him go
He got the urge for going
When the meadow grass was turning brown
Summertime was falling down and winter
was closing in Now the warriors of winter they gave a
cold triumphant shout
And all that stays is dying and all that
lives is camping out
See the geese in chevron flight flapping
and racing on before the snow They got the urge for going
And they got the wings so they can go
They get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
Summertime is falling down and winter
is closing in Apply the fire with kindling now
I'll pull the blankets up to my chin
I ll lock the vagrant winter out and
I'll fold my wandering in
I'd like to call back summertime
Have her stay for just another
month or so But she's got the urge for gong
So I guess she'll have to go
She gets the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
All her empire's falling down
And winter's closing in
And I get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
And summertime is falling down I had a king in a tenement castle
Lately he's taken to painting the pastel walls brown
He's taken the curtains down
He's swept with the broom of contempt
And the rooms have an empty ring
He's cleaned with the tears
Of an actor who fears for the laughter's sting I can't go back there anymore
You know my keys won't fit the door
You know my thoughts don't fit the man
They never can they never can I had a king dressed in drip-dry and paisley
Lately he's taken to saying I'm crazy and blind
He lives in another time
Ladies in gingham still blush
While he sings them of wars and wine
But I in my leather and lace
I can never become that kind I can't go back there anymore
You know my keys won't fit the door
You know my thoughts don't fit the man
They never can they never can I had a king in a salt-rusted carriage
Who carried me off to his country for marriage too soon
Beware of the power of moons
There's no one to blame
No there's no one to name as a traitor here
The king's on the road
And the queen's in the grove till the end of the year I can't go back there anymore
You know my keys won't fit the door
You know my thoughts don't fit the man
They never can they never can See the stretching sun at dawning
Wipe the stardust from his eyes
Feel the morning breezes yawning
Telling me it's time to rise
Telling me it's time to rise I was born to take the highway
I was born to chase a dream
Any road at all is my way
Any place is where I've been
Anything is what I've seen Gambler's gold is made for squandering
Miser's silver is to hoard
My gold as the sky goes wandering
My silver is the drinking goard
My silver is the drinking goard I was born to take the highway
I was born to chase a dream
Any road at all is my way
Any place is where I've been
Anything is what I've seen I've skipped on concrete
Danced on cobbles
Stepped on pavement in the heat
I've seen where children crouched at marbles
Made chalk circles in the street
Found a penny at my feet
Found a penny at my feet I was born to take the highway
I was born to chase a dream
Any road at all is my way
Any place is where I've been
Anything is what I've seen Now I know a road that winds forever
Through the land the rainbows run
You cross the bridge from now till never
Take the first turn past the sun
Take the first turn beyond the sun I was born to take the highway
I was born to chase a dream
Any road at all is my way
Any place is where I've been
Anything is what I've seen I met a young soldier
He said his name was Killer Kyle
He was shakin all over
Like a night-frightened child
This is his story
It's a tough one for me to sing
Hard as the squawk and the flap
And the beat of, the beat of black wings They gave me a gun, he said
 They gave me a mission
For the power and the glory, 
Propaganda, piss on em
There's a war zone inside me, 
I can feel things exploding, 
I can't even hear the fucking music playing
For the beat of, the beat of black wings. He said, I never had nothin, 
Nothin I could believe in
My girl killed our unborn child
Without even grievin!
I put my hands on her belly
To feel the kid kickin, damn!
She'd been to some clinic
Oh, the beat of black wings. They want you, they need you, 
They train you to kill, 
To be a pin on some map, 
Some vicarious thrill, 
The old hate the young
That's the whole heartless thing
The old pick the wars
We die in em
To the beat of, the beat of black wings. There's a man drawing pictures
On the sidewalk with chalk
Just as fast as he draws em
Rain come down and wash em off
 Keep the drinks comin girl
Til I can't feel anything
I'm just a chalk mark in a rainstorm
I'm just the beat of black wings. It came to pass
Like lightening striking from above
Electric flash
Just like lightening striking from above
Struck by precious love
Precious, precious love
So hopeless and so inspired
Why do you dream flat tires
When you dream flat tires?
You dream flat tires With a jack and a spare you're there
Trying to get to where love is
Coming in on a wing and a prayer
Trying to get to where love is
Cause love is precious love
You said it was precious
When first you felt my fire
Before you dreamed flat tires
You dreamed flat tires
You dream flat tires Woman she bounce back easy
But a man could break both his legs 
Are you telling me that to tease me?
Or just to hear me beg
 Please don't go! Cause I know that you love me
But, when are you going to let love be
Just a vague flirtation
Or extra special company?
Cause love is precious love
Everybody knows it's precious
When first they feel that fire
Before they dream flat tires
They dream flat tires
They dream flat tires Woman she bounce back easy
But a man could break both his legs 
Do you tell me that to tease me
Or just to hear me beg
 Please don't be cold I know that you love me
But, what are you going to let love do?
Flat tires, love, love is precious, flat tires,
love, love is precious, flat tires, love,
love is precious
Caught in the middle
Carol we're middle class
We're middle aged
We were wild in the old days
Birth of rock n roll days
Now your kids are coming up straight
And my child's a stranger
I bore her
But I could not raise her
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long Down at the Chinese Cafe
We'd be dreaming on our dimes
We'd be playing Oh my love, my darling 
One more time Uranium money
Is booming in the old home town now
It's putting up sleek concrete
Tearing the old landmarks down now
Paving over brave little parks
Ripping off Indian land again
How long how long
Short sighted business men
Ah nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long Down at the Chinese Cafe
We'd be dreaming on our dimes
We'd be playing You give your love, so sweetly 
One more time Christmas is sparkling
Out on Carol's lawn
This girl of my childhood games
With kids nearly grown and gone
Grown so fast
Like the turn of a page
We look like our mothers did now
When we were those kids age
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Down at the Chinese Cafe
We'd be dreaming on our dimes
We'd be playing
 Oh my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me 
Time goes - where does the time go
I wonder where the time goes
You've changed
The sparkle in your eyes is gone
Your smile is just a careless yawn
You're breaking my heart
You've changed You've changed
Your kisses now are so blasé
You're bored with me in every way
I can't understand
You've changed You've forgotten the words I love you
And the memories that we've shared
You've ignored all the stars up above you
I can't realize that you ever cared
You've changed You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me, I know we're through
It's all over now
You've changed You've forgotten the words I love you
And the memories that we've shared
You ignore all the stars up above you
I can't realize that you ever cared
You've changed You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me, I know we're through
It's all over now
You've changed Where are you now
Are you in some hotel room
Does it have a view?
Are you caught in a crowd
Or holding some honey
Who came on to you?
Why do you have to be so jive
O.k. hang up the phone
It hurts
But something survives
Though it's undermined
I'd still like to see you sometime I'm feeling so good
And my friends all tell me
That I'm looking fine
I run in the woods
I spring from the boulders
Like a mama lion
I'm not ready to
Change my name again
But you know I'm not after
A piece of your fortune
And your fame
cause I tasted mine
I'd just like to see you sometime Pack your suspenders
I'll come meet your plane
No need to surrender
I just want to see you again We're in for more rain
I could sure use some sunshine on my apple trees
It seems such a shame
We start out so kind and end so heartlessly
I couldn't take them all on then
With a headful of questions and hypes
So when the hopes got so slim
I just resigned
But I'd still like to see you sometime
I'd sure like to see you My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head
The way he described it
He said I'd be better dead than alive
I didn't listen to his jive
I knew all along
That he was all wrong
And I knew that he thought
I was crazy but I'm not
don't know My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head
He said I need treatment
But I'm not that easily led
He said I was the type
That was most inclined
When out of his sight
To be out of my mind
And he thought I was nuts
No more ifs or ands or buts They say as a child
I appeared a little bit wild
With all my crazy ideas
But I knew what was happening
I knew I was a genius,
What's so strange when you know
That you're a wizard at three
I knew that this was meant to be Now I heard little children
Were supposed to sleep tight
That's why I got into the vodka one night
My parents got frantic
Didn't know what to do
But I saw some crazy scenes
Before I came to
Now do you think I was crazy
I may have been only three
But I was swinging They all laugh at angry young men
They all laughed at Edison
And also at Einstein
So why should I be sorry
If they just couldn't understand
The idiomatic logic
That went on in my head
I had a brain
It was insane
Oh they used to laugh at me
When I refused to ride
On those double decker buses
All because there was no driver on the top My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head
But I said dear doctor
I think that it's you instead
Because I, I got a thing
That's unique and new
To prove it I'll have
The last laugh on you
Cause instead of one head
I got two
And you know two heads are better than one. Out of the fire like Catholic saints
Comes Scarlett and her deep complaint
Mimicking tenderness she sees
In sentimental movies A celluloid rider comes to town
Cinematic lovers sway
Plantations and sweeping ballroom gowns
Take her breath away Out in the wind in crinolines
Chasing the ghosts of Gable and Flynn
Through stand-in boys and extra players
Magnolias hopeful in her auburn hair She comes from a school of southern charm
She likes to have things her way
Any man in the world holding out his arm
Would soon be made to pay Friends have told her not so proud
Neighbors trying to sleep and yelling not so loud
Lovers in anger, block of ice
Harder and harder just to be nice Given in the night to dark dreams
From the dark things she feels
She covers her eyes in the x-rated scenes
Running from the reels Beauty and madness to be praised
Cause it is not easy to be brave
To walk around in so much need
To carry the weight of all that greed Dressed in stolen clothes she stands
Cast iron and frail
With her impossibly gentle hands
And her blood red fingernails Out of the fire and still smoldering
She says, A woman must have everything 
Shades of Scarlett Conquering
She says, A woman must have everything Shiny toys, right on time
shiny toys, right on time

to buy myself a mandolin
and i saw the long white dress of love
on a storefront mannequin
big boat chuggin back with a belly full of cars,
all for something lacy
some girl's going to see that dress
and crave that day like crazy
Little indian kids on a bridge up in canada
they can balance and they can climb
like their fathers before them
they'll walk the girders of the manhattan skyline
shine your light on me miss liberty
because as soon as this ferry boat docks
i'm headed to the church
to play bingo
fleece me with the gamblers flocks
I can keep my cool at poker
but i'm a fool when love's at stake
because i can't conceal emotion
what i'm feeling's always written on my face
there's a gypsy down on bleecker street
i went in to see her as a kind of joke
and she lit a candle for my love luck
and eighteen bucks went up in smoke
Sharon, i left my man
at a north dakota junction
and i came out to the big apple here
to face the dream's malfunction
love's a repetitious danger
you'd think i'd be accustomed to
well, i do accept the changes
at least better than i used to do
A woman i knew just drowned herself
the well was deep and muddy
she was just shaking off futility
or punishing somebody
my friends were calling up all day yesterday
all emotions and abstractions
it seems we all live so close to that line
and so far from satisfaction
Dora says, have children! 
mama and betsy say, find yourself a charity. 
help the needy and the crippled or put some time into ecology. 
well, there's a wide wide world of noble causes
and lovely landscapes to discover
but all i really want right now
is, find another lover
When we were kids in maidstone, sharon
i went to every wedding in that little town
to see the tears and the kisses
and the pretty lady in the white lace wedding gown
and walking home on the railroad tracks
or swinging on the playground swing
love stimulated my illusions
more than anything
And when i went skating after golden reggie
you know it was white lace i was chasing
chasing dreams
mama's nylons underneath my cowgirl jeans
he showed me first you get the kisses
and then you get the tears
but the ceremony of the bells and lace
still veils this reckless fool here
Now there are 29 skaters on wolmann rink
circling in singles and in pairs
in this vigorous anonymity
a blank face at the window stares and stares and stares and stares
and the power of reason
and the flowers of deep feeling
seem to serve me
only to deceive me
Sharon you've got a husband
and a family and a farm
i've got the apple of temptation
and a diamond snake around my arm
but you still have your music
and i've still got my eyes on the land and the sky
you sing for your friends and your family
i'll walk green pastures by and by Joni's lighthearted take on london bridge was a crowd pleaser in her mid-sixties club show, before she signed her first recording contract. this transcription includes spoken patter
Combined with her music, enchanted audiences back in the early days when joni was playing the smaller, more intimate venues she has always enjoyed most. spoken words are in italics
London bridge is falling down
See the people in my town
They're the ones who bring it down
it's true they've been for centuries,
Walking by it and saying, you know,
London bridge really is falling down, poor thing,
It just fell down in shame
My fair lady-o London bridge is falling up
Save the tea leaves in my cup
Guess the cup is cracking up
My fair lady-o
I'll have to get a pyrex one
London bridge is up for sale
Booze heads put my friend in jail
Spent my bridge money on bail
My fair lady-o
sure would've like to have bought that bridge
couldn't let him go to jail
If the bridge belonged to me
I would serve you tarts and tea
Smiles, that's all the tolls would be
don't grant you people would be getting across at all
My fair lady-o On the bridge there stands a car
Painted with peculiar flowers
It's the beatles it's not ours
guess they're looking at the bridge
hope they buy it
My fair lady-o London bridge is falling down
something like that
London bridge is coming down
Coming down on london bridge
Ice cubes melting in my fridge they always, do you know those fridges are terrible, they're always melting things and ice cubes are dripping all over the floor
and the vegetables are all rotten and your friend turns to you in her very british way and she says: you know I paid two bob for this. it smells a bit peculiar doesn't it, but don't you t
well, we can serve it anyway and she does
Coming down on london bridge
Mutton rotting in my fridge
Coming dow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
Coming-ming-ming-ming-ming-ming
a little electronic music there for your pleasure
Coming down on london bridge
My fair lady-o I'm Don Juan's reckless daughter
I came out two days on your tail
Those two bald-headed days in November
Before the first snowflakes sail
Out on the vast and subtle plains of mystery
A split tongue spirit talks
Noble as a nickel chief
Striking up an old juke box
And he says:
 Snakes along the railroad tracks. 
He says, Eagles in jet trails, 
He says, Coils around feathers and talons on scales,
Gravel under the belly plates, 
He says, Wind in the Wings, 
He says, Big bird dragging its tail in the dust,
Snake kite flying on a string. I come from open prairie
Given some wisdom and a lot of jive!
Last night the ghosts of my old ideas
Reran on channel five
And it howled so spooky for its eagle soul
I nearly broke down and cried
But the split tongue spirit laughed at me
He says, Your serpent cannot be denied. 
Our serpents love the whisky bars
They love the romance of the crime
But didn't I see a neon sign
Fester on your hotel blind
And a country road come off the wall
And swoop down at the crowd at the bar
And put me at the top of your danger list
Just for being so much like you are! You're a coward against the altitude, 
You're a coward against the flesh, 
Coward, caught between yes and no
Reckless this time on the line for yes, yes, yes!
Reckless brazen in the play
Of your changing traffic lights
Coward, slinking down the hall
to another restless night
As we center behind the eight ball
As we rock between the sheets
As we siphon the colored language
Off the farms and the streets
Here in Good-Old-God-Save-America
the home of the brave and the free
We are all hopelessly oppressed cowards
Of some duality
Of restless multiplicity
Oh say can you see
Restless for streets and honky tonks
Restless for home and routine
Restless for country-safety-and her
Restless for the likes of reckless me
Restless sweeps like fire and rain
Over virgin wilderness
It prowls like hookers and thieves
Through bolt locked tenements
Behind my bolt locked door
The eagle and the serpent are at war in me
The serpent fighting for blind desire
The eagle for clarity
What strange prizes these battles bring
These hectic joys-these weary blues
Puffed up and strutting when I think I win
Down and shaken when I think I lose
There are rivets up here in this eagle
There are box cars down there on your snake
And we are twins of spirit
No matter which route home we take
Or what we forsake
We're going to come up to the eyes of clarity
And we'll go down to the beads of guile
There is danger and education
In living out such a reckless life style
I touched you on the central plains
It was plane to train my twin
It was just plane shadow to train shadow
But to me it was skin to skin
The spirit talks in spectrums
He talks to mother earth to father sky
Self indulgence to self denial
Man to woman
Scales to feathers
You and I
Eagles in the sky
You and I
Snakes in the grass
You and I
Crawl and fly
You and I There was a moon and a street lamp
i didn't know i drank such a lot
till i pissed a tequila-anaconda
the full length of the parking lot!
oh, i talk too loose
again i talk too open and free
i pay a high price for my open talking
like you do for your silent mystery
Come and talk to me
please talk to me
talk to me, talk to me
mr. mystery
We could talk about martha
we could talk about landscapes
i'm not above gossip
but i'll sit on a secret where honor is at stake!
or we could talk about power
about jesus and hitler and howard hughes
or charlie chaplin's movies
or bergman's nordic blues
please just talk to me
any old theme you choose
just come and talk to me
mr. mystery, talk to me
You could talk like a fool-i'd listen
you could talk like a sage
anyway the best of my mind
all goes down on the strings and the page
that mind picks up all these pictures
it still gets my feet up to dance
even though it's covered with keyloids
from the slings and arrows of outrageous romance 
i stole that from willy the shake!
you know,  neither a borrower nor a lender be 
romeo, romeo talk to me!
Is your silence that golden?
are you comfortable in it?
is it the key to your freedom
or is it the bars on your prison?
are you gagged by your ribbons?
are you really exclusive or just miserly?
you spend every sentence as if it was marked currency!
come and spend some on me, 
shut me up and talk to me!
i'm always talking!
chicken squawking!
please talk to me Once in a while
In a big blue moon
There comes a night like this
Like some surrealist
Invented this 4th of July
Night ride home Hula girls
And caterpillar tractors in the sand
The ukulele man
The fireworks
This 4th of July
Night ride home I love the man beside me
We love the open road
No phones till Friday
Far from the overkill
Far from the overload Back at the bar
The band tears down
But out here in the headlight beams
The silver powerlines
Gleam
On this 4th of July
Night ride home Round the curve
And a big dark horse
Red taillights on his hide
Is keeping right alongside
Rev for stride
4th of July
Night ride home I love the man beside me
We love the open road
No phones till Friday
Far from the undertow
Far from the overload Once in awhile
In a big blue moon
There comes a night like this
Like some surrealist
Invented this 4th of July
Night ride home I picked the morning paper off the floor
it was full of other people's little wars
wouldn't they like their peace
don't we get bored
and we call for the three great stimulants
of the exhausted ones
artifice, brutality and innocence
artifice and innocence
No tanks have ever rumbled through these streets
and the drone of planes at night has never frightened me
i keep the hours and the company that i please
and we call for the three great stimulants
of the exhausted ones
artifice, brutality and innocence
artifice and innocence
Oh and deep in the night
our appetites find us
release us and bind us
deep in the night
while madmen sit up building bombs
and making laws and bars
they'd like to slam free choice behind us
I saw a little lawyer on the tube
he said, it's so easy now, anyone can sue. 
 let me show you how your petty aggravations can profit you! 
call for the three great stimulants
of the exhausted ones
artifice, brutality and innocence
artifice and innocence
Oh and deep in the night
appetites find us
release us and blind us
deep in the night
while madmen sit up building bombs
and making laws and bars
they're gonna slam free choice behind us
Last night i dreamed i saw the planet flicker
great forests fell like buffalo
everything got sicker
and to the bitter end
big business bickered
and they call for the three great stimulants
of the exhausted ones
artifice, brutality and innocence
artifice and innocence
Oh these times, these times
oh these changing times
change in the heart of all mankind
oh these troubled times If you can keep your head
While all about you
People are losing theirs and blaming you
If you can trust yourself
When everybody doubts you
And make allowance for their doubting too. If you can wait
And not get tired of waiting
And when lied about
Stand tall
Don't deal in lies
And when hated
Don't give in to hating back
Don't need to look so good
Don't need to talk too wise. If you can dream
And not make dreams your master
If you can think
And not make intellect your game
If you can meet
With triumph and disaster
And treat those two imposters just the same If you can force your heart
And nerve and sinew
To serve you
After all of them are gone
And so hold on
When there is nothing in you
Nothing but the will
That's telling you to hold on!
Hold on! If you can bear to hear
The truth you've spoken
Twisted and misconstrued
By some smug fool
Or watch your life's work
Torn apart and broken down
And still stoop to build again
With worn out tools. If you can draw a crowd
And keep your virtue
Or walk with Kings
And keep the common touch
If neither enemies nor loving friends
Can hurt you
If everybody counts with you
But none too much. If you can fill the journey
Of a minute
With sixty seconds worth of wonder and delight
Then
The Earth is yours
And Everything that's in it
But more than that
I know
You'll be alright
You'll be alright. Cause you've got the fight
You've got the insight
You've got the fight
You've got the insight Varnished weeds in window jars
Tarnished beads on tapestries
Kept in satin boxes are
Reflections of love's memories Letters from across the seas
Roses dipped in sealing wax
Valentines and maple leaves
Tucked into a paperback Guess I'll throw them all away
I found someone to love today Dark with darker moods is he
Not a golden Prince who's come
Through columbines and wizardry
To talk of castles in the sun Still I'll take a chance and see
I found someone to love today There's a sorrow in his eyes
Like the angel made of tin
What will happen if I try
To place another heart in him In a Bleeker Street cafe
I found someone to love today
I found someone to love today You wanna make Van Goghs
Raise em up like sheep
Make em out of Eskimos
And women if you please
Make em nice and normal
Make em nice and neat
You see him with his shotgun there?
Bloodied in the wheat?
Oh what do you know about
Living in Turbulent Indigo? Brash fields, crude crows
In a scary sky,
In a golden frame
Roped off
Tourists guided by,
Tourists talking about the madhouse
Talking about the ear
The madman hangs in fancy homes
They wouldn't let him near!
He'd piss in their fireplace!
He'd drag them through Turbulent Indigo I'm a burning hearth, he said
 People see the smoke
But no one comes to warm themselves
Sloughing off a coat
And all my little landscapes
All my yellow afternoons
Stack up around this vacancy
Like dirty cups and spoons
No mercy Sweet Jesus!
No mercy from Turbulent Indigo. I was in an all night movie
When I heard the usher say
Here comes the midnight cowboy
Got his gun hired out for pay;
You were walking kind of faded
From the netherlands hotel
With your hat tipped off to ladies
Really looking well. Aw joe, why don't you go back home?
Really hate to see you falling down
Get out of town. Well you came to new york city with a calendar full of gold
Now they locked it up in the bedroom
And they kicked you out in the cold;
Now you can't afford a little blanket
You can get one from a friend
You can trick one off the corner
You can even keep the change - to spend. Hey joe, why don't you go back home?
Really hate to see you come falling down
Get out of town. There's a soldier in the depot
He's a fighting nightingale
Wearing western boots and buckskin on
Reading fortunes from the penny scale;
Now today he's got a a quarter
For the photograph machine
But tomorrow he'll be lonely lonely
That's the way it's always been. Poor joe, why don't you go back home?
Really hate to see you falling down
Get out of town. I was in an all night movie
When I heard the usher say
Here comes the midnight cowboy again
Got his gun hired out for pay;
You were walking kind of faded
From the netherlands hotel
Hat tipped off to ladies
Tipped off to gentlemen as well. Well joe, why don't you go back home?
Find yourself a girl and settle down
Get out of town
Get out of town
Find yourself a girl, go and settle down
Hey joe, looking more lost than found
Get out of town. Tomorrow is Sunday
Now there's only one day left to go
Till you walk by
Below my window
The weekends drive me mad
Holidays are oh too sad
Cause you don't go
Below my window No one knows I'm here
One day I just disappeared
And I took these two grey rooms up here
With a view
When you walk by
Below my window You look so youthful
Time has been untruthful
Heaven knows I loved you
30 years ago
Hot days your shirt's undone
Rainy days you run
Oh and then you fade so fast
Below my window No one knows I'm here
One day I just disappeared
And I took these two grey rooms up here
With a view
Only when you walk by
Below my window
When you walk by Below my window
Below my window
Hey hey
Below my window
Below my window
Below my window Marcie in a coat of flowers
Steps inside a candy store
Reds are sweet and greens are sour
Still no letter at her door
So she'll wash her flower curtains
Hang them in the wind to dry
Dust her tables with his shirt and
Wave another day goodbye Marcie's faucet needs a plumber
Marcie's sorrow needs a man
Red is autumn green is summer
Greens are turning and the sand
All along the ocean beaches
Stares up empty at the sky
Marcie buys a bag of peaches
Stops a postman passing by
And summer goes
Falls to the sidewalk like string and brown paper
Winter blows
Up from the river there's no one to take her
To the sea Marcie dresses warm its snowing
Takes a yellow cab uptown
Red is stop and green's for going
Sees a show and rides back down
Down along the Hudson River
Past the shipyards in the cold
Still no letter's been delivered
Still the winter days unfold
Like magazines
Fading in dusty grey attics and cellars
Make a dream
Dream back to summer and hear how
he tells her
Wait for me Marcie leaves and doesn't tell us
Where or why she moved away
Red is angry green is jealous
That was all she had to say
Someone thought they saw her Sunday
Window shopping in the rain
Someone heard she bought a one-way ticket
And went west again I was an unmarried girl
I'd just turned twenty-seven
When they sent me to the sisters
For the way men looked at me
Branded as a jezebel
I knew I was not bound for Heaven
I'd be cast in shame
Into the Magdalene laundries Most girls come here pregnant
Some by their own fathers
Bridget got that belly
By her parish priest
We're trying to get things white as snow
All of us woe-begotten-daughters
In the streaming stains
Of the Magdalene laundries Prostitutes and destitutes
And temptresses like me, 
Fallen women, 
Sentenced into dreamless drudgery,
Why do they call this heartless place
Our Lady of Charity?
Oh charity! These bloodless brides of Jesus
If they had just once glimpsed their groom
Then they'd know, and they'd drop the stones
Concealed behind their rosaries
They wilt the grass they walk upon
They leech the light out of a room
They'd like to drive us down the drain
At the Magdalene laundries Peg O'Connell died today
She was a cheeky girl
A flirt
They just stuffed her in a hole!
Surely to God you'd think at least some bells should ring!
One day I'm going to die here too
And they'll plant me in the dirt
Like some lame bulb
That never blooms come any spring
Not any spring
No, not any spring
Not any spring kiss my ass! i said
and i threw my drink
tequila trickling
down his business suit
must be the irish blood
fight before you think
turn it now

you can't undo it
it's his town
and that went down
like a lead balloon
lead lead lead lead balloon
he said sic her, rover 
that went over
like a lead balloon

An angry man is just an angry man
but an angry woman
bitch!
i had to ask him for a helping hand
it came with the heart
of a bonaparte
of a frozen fish
it's his town
and that went down
like a lead balloon
lead lead lead lead balloon
he said sic her, rover

Lakota!
Looking at money man, 
Diggin the deadly quotas, 
Out of balance, 
Out of hand
We want the land!
Lay down the reeking ore!
Don't you hear the shrieking in the trees?
Everywhere you touch the earth, she's sore
Every time you skin her all things weep
Your money mocks us, 
Restitution, what good can it do?
Kennelled in metered boxes
Red dogs in debt to you I am Lakota!
Lakota!
Fighting among ourselves
All we can say with one whole heart
Is we won't sell, 
No we'll never sell
We want the land!
The lonely coyote calls
In the woodlands, footprints of the deer
In the barrooms, poor drunk bastard falls
In the courtrooms, deaf ears, sixty years
You think we're sleeping, but
Quietly like rattlesnakes and stars
We have seen the trampled rainbows
In the smoke of cars I am Lakota
Brave
Sun pity me
I am Lakota
Broken
Moon pity me
I am Lakota
Grave
Shadows stretching
Lakota
Oh pity me
I am Lakota
Weak
Grass pity me
I am Lakota
Faithful
Rocks pity me
I am Lakota
Meek
Standing water
Lakota
Oh pity me I am Lakota!
Lakota!
Standing on sacred land
We never sold these Black Hills
To the missile-heads, 
To the power plants
We want the land!
The bullet and the fence, broke Lakota
The black coats and the booze, broke Lakota
Courts that circumvent, choke Lakota
Nothing left to lose
Tell me grandfather
You spoke the fur and feather tongues, 
Do you hear the whimpering waters
When the tractors come? Repeat Chorus Sun pity me
Mother earth
Mother
Moon pity me
Father sky

Stretching on the forest floor
Mother earth
Oh pity me

Standing in a wakan manner

Oh pity me Well, I've heard of heartbreakers
But you take the cake
Ladies man
You could charm the diamonds
Off a rattlesnake
Ladies man
Ladies bring it on over
When you give em the glance
They don't stand a chance
First, you unfold them
Then you pigeon-hole em
Ladies man Well it sure takes a lot of
Good natured self-control
Ladies man
When I'm so hot for you and
You're so cold, so cold
Ladies man
Why do you keep on trying to
Make a man of me
Couldn't you just love me, 
Like you love cocaine
Cocaine head games Cross my heart I swear
I'm not trying to trick you
No tricks
Ladies man
It's just a straight ahead feeling
I have for you
Nothing slick
Ladies man
I guess you learn to refuse
What you think you can't handle
You're acting like a vandal
Wrecking the dream
At the first bad scene
Ladies man
Ladies man
Ladies man
Ladies man Trinna wears her wampum beads
She fills her drawing book with lines
Sweing lace on widows weeds
And filagree on leaf and vine
Vine and leave are filagree
And her coats a second hand one
Trimmed in antique luxury
She is a lady of the canyon Annie sits you down to eat
She always makes you welcome in
Cats and babies round her feet
And all are fat and none are thin
None are thin and all are fat
She may bake some brownies today
Saying, you are welcome back
She is another canyon lady Estrella circus girl
Comes wrapped in songs and gypsy shalws
Songs like tiny hammers hurled
At bevelled mirrors in empty halls
Empty halles and bevelled mirrors
Sailing seas and climbing banyans
Come out for a visit here
To be a lady of the canyon Trinna takes her pains and her threads
And she weaves a pattern all her own
Annie bakes her cakes and her breads
And she gathers flowers for her home
For her home she gathers flowers
And Estrella, dear companion
Colors up the sunshine hours
Pouring music down the canyon
Coloring the sunshine hours
They are the ladies of the canyon A red sun came rolling down a grey sky
And the frogs and dogs and night birds then
Started up singing sweet country lullaby
You see that patch of city lights,
Somewhere in there's cotton avenue,
That's where I'm going to take myself tonight
With a spit shine on my dancing shoes If you got a place like that to go
You just have to go there
If you got no place special
Well then, you just go no place special I guess it's just the summer in the young blood
Ripe and juicy in the young blood
Teasing to go down to,
Cotton avenue
To hear the shiny shiny music
See all the shiny people dancing to it
Anytime you go to,
Cotton avenue If you got a place like that to go
You know you got to go there
If you got no place special
Well then, you just go no place special You see that summer storm brewing in the southern sky
By the time it hits here I'll be dancing high and dry
To rhythm and blues
On cotton avenue
Poor boys'll be hanging around outside in the street
They got all the latest words
They're dancing to the latest beat
While they're hustling and sizing you
On cotton avenue If you got a place like that to go
You just have to go there
If you've got no place special
Well my dear
You just so no place, special Let me speak, let me spit out my bitterness, 
Born of grief and nights without sleep and festering flesh
Do you have eyes?
Can you see like mankind sees?
Why have you soured and curdled me?
Oh you tireless watcher! what have i done to you?
That you make everything i dread and everything i fear come true? Once i was blessed; i was awaited like the rain
Like eyes for the blind, like feet for the lame
Kings heard my words, and they sought out my company
But now the janitors of shadowland flick their brooms at me
Oh you tireless watcher! what have i done to you?
That you make everything i dread and everything i fear come true? antagonists: man is the sire of sorrow
I've lost all taste for life
I'm all complaints
Tell me why do you starve the faithful?
Why do you crucify the saints?
And you let the wicked prosper
You let their children frisk like deer
And my loves are dead or dying, or they don't come near
antagonists: we don't despise your chastening
God is correcting you
Oh and look who comes to counsel my deep distress
Oh, these pompous physicians
What carelessness!
antagonists: oh all this ranting all this wind
Filling our ears with trash
Breathtaking ignorance adding insult to injury!
They come blaming and shaming
antagonists: evil doer
And shattering me
antagonists: this vain man wishes to seem wise
A man born of asses
Oh you tireless watcher! what have i done to you?
That you make everything i dread and everything i fear come true? antagonists: we don't despise your chastening
Already on a bed of sighs and screams,
And still you torture me with visions
You give me terrifying dreams!
Better i was carried from the womb straight to the grave.
I see the diggers waiting, they're leaning on their spades. antagonists: man is the sire of sorrow
Sure as the sparks ascend
Where is hope while you're wondering what went wrong?
Why give me light and then this dark without a dawn?
antagonists: evil is sweet in your mouth
Hiding under your tongue
Show your face!
antagonists: what a long fall from grace
Help me understand!
What is the reason for your heavy hand?
antagonists: you're stumbling in shadows
You have no name now
Was it the sins of my youth?
What have i done to you?
That you make everything i dread and everything i fear come true?
antagonists: oh your guilt must weigh so greatly
Everything i dread and everything i fear come true
antagonists: man is the sire of sorrow
Oh you make everything i dread and everything i fear come true The story hit the news
from coast to coast
they said you beat the girl
you loved the most
your charitable acts
seemed out of place
with the beauty
with your fist marks on her face
your buddies all stood by
they bet their fortunes
and their fame
that she was out of line
and you were not to blame
Six hundred thousand doctors
are putting on rubber gloves
and they're poking
at the miseries made of love
they say they're learning
how to spot
the battered wives
among all the women
they see bleeding through their lives
i bleed, 
for your perversity, 
these red words that make a stain
on your white-washed claim that
she was out of line
and you were not to blame
I heard your baby say
when he was only three
 daddy, let's get some girls
one for you and one for me. 
his mother had the frailty
you despise
and the looks
you love to drive to suicide
not one wet eye around
her lonely little grave
said, he was out of line girl
you were not to blame. Through the windless wells of wonder
by the throbbing light machine
in a tea leaf trance or under
orders from the king and queen
Songs to aging children come
aging children, i am one
People hurry by so quickly
don't they hear the melodies
in the chiming and the clicking
and the laughing harmonies
Songs to aging children come
aging children, i am one
Some come dark and strange like dying
crows and ravens whistling
lines of weeping, strings of crying
so much said in listening
Songs to aging children come
aging children, i am one
Does the moon play only silver
when it strums the galaxy
dying roses will they will their
perfumed rhapsodies to me
Songs to aging children came
this is one Blue, songs are like tattoos
You know I've been to sea before
Crown and anchor me
Or let me sail away
Hey Blue, THERE is a song for you
Ink on a pin
Underneath the skin
An empty space to fill in
Well there're so many sinking now
You've got to keep thinking
You can make it thru these waves
Acid, booze, and ass
Needles, guns, and grass
Lots of laughs, lots of laughs
Everybody's saying that hell's the hippest way to go
Well I don't think so
But I'm gonna take a look around it though
Blue, I love you Blue, here is a shell for you
Inside you'll hear a sigh
A foggy lullaby
There is your song from me You could have been more
than a name on the door
on the thirty-third floor in the air
more than a credit card
swimming pool in the backyard
While you still have the time
you could get away and find
a better life, you know the grind is so ungrateful
racing cars, whisky bars
no one cares who you really are
you're the keeper of the cards
yes i know it gets hard
keeping the wheels turning
and the wife she keeps the keys
she is so pleased to be
a part of the arrangement
You could have been more
than a name on the door
on the thirty-third floor in the air
more than a consumer
lying in some roam trying to die
more than a credit card
swimming pool in the backyard
you could have been more than a name on the door
you could have been more than a name on the door
you could have been more
you could have been more
you could have been more She pulls the shade;
It's just another sunny Sunday
She dodges the light like Blanche DuBois
Bright colors fade away on such a sunny Sunday;
She waits for the night to fall
Then she points a pistol through the door
And she aims at the streetlight
While the freeway hisses
Dogs bark as the gun falls to the floor
The streetlight's still burning;
She always misses
But the day she hits
That's the day she'll leave
That one little victory, that's all she needs!
She pulls the shade;
It's just another sunny Monday
She waits for the night to fall I'm down to a roll of dimes
i'm stalking the slot that's hot
i keep hearing bells all around me
jingling in the lucky jackpots
they keep you tantalized
they keep you reaching for your wallet
here in fools paradise!
I talked to a cat from des moines
he said he ran a cleaning plant
that cat was clanking with coin
well, he must have had a genie in a lamp
cause every time, i dropped a dime, i blew it
he kept ringing bells
nothing to it!
He got three oranges
three lemons
three cherries
three plums
i'm losing my taste for fruit
watching the dry cleaner do it
like midas in a polyester suit
it's all luck!
it's just luck!
you get a little lucky and you make a little money!
I followed him down the strip
he picked out a booth at circus circus
where the cowgirls fill the room
with their big balloons
the cleaner was pitching with purpose!
he had dinos and pooh bears
and lions
pink and blue there
he couldn't lose there!
Des moines was stacking the chips
raking off the tables
ringing the bandit's bells
this is a story that's a drag to tell
in some ways
since i lost every dime
i laid on the line
but the cleaner from des moines
could put a coin
in the door of a john
and get twenty for one
it's just luck! I've been sitting up waiting for my sugar to show
i've been listening to the sirens and the radio
he said he'd be over three hours ago
i've been waiting for his car on the hill
he makes friends easy
he's not like me
i watch for judgement anxiously
now where in the city can that boy be
waiting for a car
climbing
climbing
climbing the hill
He's a real good talker
i think he's friend
fast tires come screaming around the bend
but there's still no buzzer
they roll on,
and-i'm waiting for his car on the hill
it always seems so righteous at the start
when there's so much laughter
when there's so much spark
when there's so much sweetness in the dark
waiting for a car
climbing
climbing
climbing the hill I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles
I think of rain, I think of roses blue
I think of Rose, my heart begins to tremble
To see the place she's lately gotten to
Gotten to, gotten to She's gotten to mysterious devotions
She's gotten to the zodiac and Zen
She's gotten into tarot cards and potions
She's laying her religion on her friends
On her friends, on her friends Friends who come to ask her for their future
Friends who come to find they can't be friends
Because of signs and seasons that don't suit her
She'll prophesy your death, she won't say when
Won't say when, won't say when When all the black cards come you cannot barter
No, when all your stars are stacked you cannot win
She'll shake her head and treat you like a martyr
It is her blackest spell she puts you in
Puts you in, puts you in In sorrow she can lure you where she wants you
Inside your own self-pity there you swim
In sinking down to drown her voice still haunts you
And only with your laughter can you win
Can you win, can you win You win the lasting laurels with your laughter
It reaches like an arm before you sink
To win the solitary truth you're after
You dare not ask the priestess how to think
How to think, how to think I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles
I think of rain, I think of roses blue
I think of Rose, my heart begins to tremble
To see the place she's lately gotten to
Gotten to, gotten to

Cause a mouse's stomach could never get big enough to hold a streetcar.
Goodbye goodbye goodbye. Why does a horn make music?
Why, oh why, oh why?
Because the horn-blower blows it.
Goodbye goodbye goodbye Why does a cow drink water?
Tell me why n why?
Because the cow gets thirsty just like you or me or anybody else.
Goodye goodbye goodbye. Why don't you answer my questions?
Why, oh why, oh why?
Cause I don't know the answers.
Goodby goodbye goodbye. What make the landlord take money?
Why, oh why, oh why?
I don't know that one myself.
Goodbye goodbye goodbye. Why's there no pennies for ice cream
Why, oh why, oh why?
You put all the pennies in the telephone.
Goodbye goodbye goodbye. Why can't a rabbit chase an eagle?
Tell me why, oh why?
Cause the last rabbit that took out and chased after an eagle didn't come
out so good and that's why rabbits don't chase after eagles that's all I
know about rabbits and eagles?
Because because because. Why ain't my grandpa my grandma?
Why, oh why, oh why?
Same reason your dad's not your mommy.
Goodbye goodbye goodbye. Why couldn't the wind blow backwards?
Why, oh why, oh why?
Cause it might backfire and hurt somebody and if it
hurt somebody it'd keep on hurting them
Goodbye goodbye goodbye. Oh, little doggies
It's your misfortune and not of my own
Whoop-ee-ti-yi-o get along little doggies
You know that Wyoming will be your new home A cattle trail drunk and a hard road to travel
That old Jack O Diamonds is a hard card to play
Get along, get along, get along little doggies
Get along little doggies and be on your way Whoop-ee-ti-yi-o get along little doggies
It's your misfortune and not of my own
Whoop-ee-ti-yi-o get along little doggies
You know that Wyoming will be your new home Some boys have bit this old cow trail for pleasure
But that's where they get it most awfully wrong
I wish I could tell you the troubles they give us
As we go rolling these doggies along Whoop-ee-ti-yi-o get along little doggies
It's your misfortune and not of my own
Whoop-ee-ti-yi-o get along little doggies
You know that Wyoming will be your new home Bury me beneath the willow
Neath that weeping willow tree
When she comes she'll find me sleeping
Then perhaps she'll think of me It's many a night while you? re sleeping
Sleeping in your sleeping clothes
I'm a poor boy, broken hearted
Listenin to the wind that blows Bury me beneath the willow
Neath that weeping willow tree
When she comes she'll find me sleeping
Then perhaps she'll think of me Tomorrow was to be our wedding
God, oh Lord, where can she be
She has gone to find another
She no longer cares for me Bury me beneath the willow
Neath that weeping willow tree
When she comes she'll find me sleeping
Then perhaps she'll think of me I went across the river
I lay down to sleep
I went across the river
I lay down to sleep
When I woke up
Had shackles on my feet It takes a worried man
To sing a worried song
It takes a worried man
To sing a worried song
I'm worried now
But I won't be worried long Twenty-one links
Of chain around my leg
Twenty-one links
Of chain around my leg
And on each link
S an initial of my name I asked that judge
What's gonna be my fine
I asked that judge
What's gonna be my fine
Twenty-one years
On the Rocky Mountain line That train pulled out
Twenty-one coaches long
That train pulled out
Twenty-one coaches long
And the woman I love
Is on that train and gone Twenty-one years
Pay my awful crime
Twenty-one years
Pay my awful crime
Tweny-one years
And I still got ninety-nine
World War II Version
I got the news that the war had begun
It was straight for the Army Hall that I run
And all of the people in my home town
Was a running up and a running down So long, it's been good to know you
So long, it's been good to know you
So long, it's been good to know you
There's a mighty big war that's got to be won
And we'll get back together again. The crowd was packed by the railroad track
People was yelling and patting my back
And while the engineer rung his bell
I hugged all the mothers and kissed all the gals, So long, it's been good to know you
So long, it's been good to know you
So long, it's been good to know you
There's a mighty big war that's got to be won
And we'll get back together again I got to the camp and I learnt how to fight
Fascists in daytime, mosquitoes at night
I got my orders to cross over the sea
So I waved goodbye to the girls I could see, So long, it's been good to know you
So long, it's been good to know you
So long, it's been good to know you
There's a mighty big war that's got to be won
And we'll get back together again I got on a boat and I started to float
My old pack-sack and my big wool coat
With ten thousand men we rode the foam
And sung this song to the people back home: So long, it's been good to know you
So long, it's been good to know you
So long, it's been good to know you
There's a mighty big war that's got to be won
And we'll get back together again I landed somewhere on a fighting shore
With ten million soldiers and ten million more
And while we were chasing that Super Race
We sung this song in the chase.
It was: So long, it's been good to know you
So long, it's been good to know you
So long, it's been good to know you
There's a mighty big war that's got to be won
And we'll get back together again So it won't be long till the fascists are gone
And all of their likes are finished and done
We'll throw the clods of dirt in their face
And walk away from that lonesome place So long, it's been good to know you
So long, it's been good to know you
So long, it's been good to know you
There's a mighty big war that's got to be won
And we'll get back together again In the world's mighty gallery of pictures
Hang the scenes that're painted from life
There's pictures of love and of passion
And there's pictures of keys and of strife There hung pictures of youth and of beauty
Of old age and a blushing young bride
They all hung on the wall but the saddest of all
Are the pictures from life's other side Just a picture from life's other side
Someone has fell by the way
A life has gone out with the tide
That might have been happy some day There's a poor old mother at home
She's watching and waiting alone
Just longing to hear from a loved one so dear
Just a picture from life's other side The first scene is that of a gambler
Who had lost all of his money at play
And he drowses dead mother's ring from his finger
Which she wore long ago on her wedding day It's his last earthly treasure but he stakes it
Then bows his head that his shame he might hide
But when they lifted his head they found he was dead
That's just a picture from life's other side Now the last scene is that by the river
Of a heartbroken mother and baby
As the harbor lights shine and they shiver
On an outcast, soon no one will save And yet she was once a true woman
She was somebody's darling and pride
God help her she leaps, oh there's no one to weep
It's just a picture from life's other side Ezekiel saw that wheel
Way up in the middle of the air
Now Ezekiel saw that wheel
Hurling way in the middle of the air Now the little wheel run by faith
And the big wheel run by the grace of God
In the wheel and a wheel hurling
Way in the middle of the air Tell you what a hypocrite, he will do
Way in the middle of the air
He'll talk about me and he'll talk about you
Way in the middle of the air Ezekiel saw that wheel hurling
Way up in the middle of the air
Ezekiel saw that wheel hurling
Way up in the middle of the air And the little wheel run by faith
And the big wheel run by the grace of God
In the wheel and a wheel hurling
Way in the middle of the air Brothers, sisters tell you what you got to do
Way in the middle of the air
Young like you give me two by two
Way in the middle of the air Ezekiel saw that wheel hurling
Way up in the middle of the air
Ezekiel saw that wheel hurling
Way in the middle of the air And the little wheel run by faith
And the big wheel run by the grace of God
In the wheel and a wheel hurling
Way up in the middle of the air Tell you what a bootlegger he will do
Way in the middle of the air
Sell you liquor and mix you booze
Way in the middle of the air Ezekiel saw that wheel hurling
Way up in the middle of the air
Ezekiel saw that wheel hurling
Way in the middle of the air And the little wheel run by faith of God
And the big wheel run by the grace of God
In the wheel and a wheel hurling
Way in the middle of the air The wheel and a wheel hurling
Way up in the middle of the air
The wheel and a wheel hurling
Way up in the middle of the air And the little wheel run by faith of God
And the big wheel run by the grace of God
In the wheel and a wheel hurling
Way in the middle of the air On Springfield Mountain there did dwell
A lovely youth I knowed him well. Too roo de nay, too roo de noo This lovely youth one day did go
Down to the meadom for to mow. Too roo de nay, too roo de noo. He scarce had mowed quite round the field
When a crul serpent bit his heel. Too roo de nay, too roo de noo. They took him home to molly dear
Which made him feel so very gueer. Too roo de nay, too roo de noo. Now Molly had two ruby lips
With which the poison she did sip. Too roo de nay, too roo de noo. Now Molly had a rotting tooth,
And so the poison killed them both. Put your finger in the air, in the air.
Put your finger in the air, in the air.
Put your finger in the air, and hold it right up there.
Put your finger in the air, in the air. Put your finger on your cheek, on your cheek.
Put your finger on your cheek, on your cheek.
Put your finger on your cheek, leave it there a week.
Put your finger on your cheek, on your cheek. Put your finger on your nose, on your nose.
Put your finger on your nose, on your nose.
Put your finger on your nose, and see if it grows.
Put your finger on your nose, on your nose. Put your finger on your ear, on your ear.
Put your finger on your ear, on your ear.
Put your finger on your ear, and leave it there a year.
Put your finger on your ear, on your ear. Put your finger on your finger, on your finger.
Put your finger on your finger, on your finger.
Put your finger on your finger, leave it there, let it linger.
Put your finger on your finger, on your finger. Come all you old time cowboys,
And listen to my song,
Please do not grow weary,
I'll not detain you long.
Concerning some wild cowboys,
Who did agree to go,
Spend the summer pleasant,
On the trail of the Buffalo.
I found myself in Griffin,
In the spring of 83,
When a well known famous drover,
Came walking up to me.
Said, How do you do, young fellow,
Well how would you like to go,
And spend the summer pleasant,
On the trail of the Buffalo? 
Well I being out of work right then,
To the drover I did say,
 Going out on the Buffalo Road,
Depends on the pay.
If you will pay good wages,
And transportation to and fro,
I think I might go with you,
On the hunt of the Buffalo. 
 Of course I'll pay good wages,
And transportation too,
If you will agree to work for me,
Until the season's through. 
But if you do get homesick,
And try to run away,
You will starve to death,
Out on the trail and also lose your pay. 
Well with all his flattering talking,
He signed up quite a train,
Some 10 or 12 in number,
Some able bodied men.
The trip it was a pleasant one,
As we hit the westward road,
Until we crossed old Boggy Creek,
In old New Mexico.
There our pleasures ended,
And our troubles began.
A lightening storm hit us,
And made the cattle run.
Got all full of stickers,
From the cactus that did not grow,
And the outlaws watching,
To pick us off in the hills of Mexico.
Well our working season ended,
And the drover would not pay,
If you had not drunk too much,
You are all in debt to me.
But the cowboys never had heard,
Such a thing as a bankrupt law,
So we left that drover's bones to bleach,
On the Plains of the Buffalo. Now, come and bathe my forehead, Mother
For I'm growing very weak
Let one drop of water, Mother,
Fall upon my burning cheek Go and tell my little playmates
That I never more will play
Give them all my toys, but Mother,
Put my little shoes away You will do this won't you Mother?
Please remember what I say
Give them all my toys, but Mother,
Put my little shoes away Santa Claus he brought them to me
With a lot of other things
And I thought he brought an angel
With a pair of golden wings Soon the baby will be larger
And they'll fit his little feet
Won't he look so nice and funny
As he walks upon the street You will do this won't you Mother?
Please remember what I say
Give them all my toys, but Mother,
Put my little shoes away There's more pretty girls than one
More pretty girls than one
Every town I rambled around
More pretty girls than one Look down that railroad line
See the train rolled by
Train rolls by with a woman I love
And I hung my head and cried More pretty girls than one
More pretty girls than one
Every town I rambled around
More pretty girls than one Look out across that sea
See the breakers swell
How many a love is washed away
No human tongue can tell There's more pretty girls than one
There's more pretty girls than one
Every town I rambled around
More pretty girls than one There's more pretty girls than one
There's more pretty girls than one
Every town I rambled around
More pretty girls than one I'm gonna tell you fascists
You may be surprised
The people in this world
Are getting organized
You're bound to lose
You fascists bound to lose Race hatred cannot stop us
This one thing we know
Your poll tax and Jim Crow
And greed has got to go
You're bound to lose
You fascists bound to lose. All of you fascists bound to lose:
I said, all of you fascists bound to lose:
Yes sir, all of you fascists bound to lose:
You're bound to lose! You fascists:
Bound to lose! People of every color
Marching side to side
Marching âcross these fields
Where a million fascists dies
You're bound to lose
You fascists bound to lose! I'm going into this battle
And take my union gun
We'll end this world of slavery
Before this battle's won
You're bound to lose
You fascists bound to lose! Lots of folks back East, they say, is leavin home every day
Beatin the hot old dusty way to the California line
Cross the desert sands they roll, gettin out of that old dust bowl
They think they're goin to a sugar bowl but here's what they find Now the police at the port of entry say
 You're number fourteen thousand for today Oh, if you ain't got the do re mi folks you ain't got the do re mi
Why you better go back to beautiful Texas
Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee California is a garden of Eden, a paradise to live in or see
But believe it or not you won't find it so hot
If you ain't got the do re mi You want to buy you a home or a farm that can't deal nobody harm
Or take your vacation by the mountains or sea
Don't swap your old cow for a car, you better stay right where you are
You better take this little tip from me Cause I look through the want ads every day
But the headlines on the papers always say If you ain't got the do re mi boys you ain't got the do re mi
Why, you better go back to beautiful Texas
Oklahoma, Kansas, Georgia, Tennessee California is a garden of Eden, a paradise to live in or see
But believe it or not you won't find it so hot
If you ain't got the do re mi I stood on the stepstone when schooldays was over
Long for the time to go by
Now that it's gone, I stand here tonight
Bid this old stepstone good bye. Goodbye to my stepstone, goodbye to my home
God bless the ones that I leave with a cry
The field will be widening and I wil be gone
To ramble this wide world alone. I stand on my stepsyone at eventide now,
The wind whistles by with a moan
Now it is gone and I stand here tonight
Goodbye to my stepstone and home. Goodbye to my stepstone, It's hard to be parted from those that we love
When reverses in fortune have come.
The world's strongest heartstrings are broken in twain
From the absence of loved ones and home. Goodbye to my stepstone, I ain't got no home, I'm just a-roamin round,
Just a wandrin worker, I go from town to town.
And the police make it hard wherever I may go
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore. My brothers and my sisters are stranded on this road,
A hot and dusty road that a million feet have trod;
Rich man took my home and drove me from my door
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore. Was a-farmin on the shares, and always I was poor;
My crops I lay into the banker's store.
My wife took down and died upon the cabin floor,
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore. I mined in your mines and I gathered in your corn
I been working, mister, since the day I was born
Now I worry all the time like I never did before
Cause I ain't got no home in this world anymore Now as I look around, it's mighty plain to see
This world is such a great and a funny place to be;
Oh, the gamblin man is rich an the workin man is poor,
And I ain't got no home in this world anymore. Jesus Christ was a man who traveled through the land
Hard working man and brave
He said to the rich, Give your goods to the poor. 
So they laid Jesus Christ in his grave. Jesus was a man, a carpenter by hand
His followers true and brave
One dirty little coward called Judas Iscariot
Has laid Jesus Christ in his grave He went to the sick, he went to the poor,
And he went to the hungry and the lame;
Said that the poor would one day win this world,
And so they laid Jesus Christ in his grave. He went to the preacher, he went to the sheriff,
Told them all the same;
Sell all of your jewelry and give it to the Poor,
But they laid Jesus Christ in his grave. When Jesus came to town, the working folks around,
Believed what he did say;
The bankers and the preachers they nailed him on a cross,
And they laid Jesus Christ in his grave. Poor working people, they follered him around,
Sung and shouted gay;
Cops and the soldiers, they nailed him in the air,
And they nailed Jesus Christ in his grave. Well the people held their breath when they heard about his death,
And everybody wondered why;
It was the landlord and the soldiers that he hired.
That nailed Jesus Christ in the sky. When the love of the poor shall one day turn to hate.
When the patience of the workers gives away
 Would be better for you rich if you never had been born 
So they laid Jesus Christ in his grave. This song was written in New York City
Of rich men, preachers and slaves
Yes, if Jesus was to preach like he preached in Galillee,
They would lay Jesus Christ in his grave. sung to Jesse James Take off, take off your shoes
This place you're standing, it's holy ground
Take off, take off your shoes
The spot you're standing, its holy ground These words I heard in my burning bush
This place you're standing, it's holy ground
I heard my fiery voice speak to me
This spot you're standing, it's holy ground That spot is holy holy ground
That place you stand it's holy ground
This place you tread, it's holy ground
God made this place his holy ground Take off your shoes and pray
The ground you walk it's holy ground
Every spot on earth I trapse around
Every spot I walk it's holy ground Every spot it's holy ground
Every little inch it's holy ground
Every grain of dirt it's holy ground
Every spot I walk it's holy ground Mermaid Avenue that's the street
Where the fast and slow folks meet,
Where the cold ones meet the hot ones
Just a block from Coney's beach.
Mermaid Avenue that's the place
Where the wolves and haybags chase
In big fur coats and bathing suits
They're in the raggeldy race Chorus But there's never been a mermaid here
On Mermaid Avenue
No, I've never seen a mermaid here
On Mermaid Avenue
I've seen hags and wags and witches;
And I've seen a shark or two
My five years that I've lived along
Old Mermaid's Avenue Mermaid Avenue that's the street
Where the lox and bagles meet,
Where the hot dog meets the mustard
Where the sour meets the sweet;
Where the beer flows to the ocean
Where the halvah meets the pickle
Where the wine runs to the sea;
Why they call it Mermaid Avenue
That's more than I can see. Mermaid Avenue that's the street
Where the saint and sinners meet;
Where the grey hair meets the wave curls
Where the cops don't ever sleep;
Where they pay some cops to stop you
When you hit that Sea Gate gate;
Where them bulls along that wire fence
Scare the mermaids all away Mermaid Avenue that's the street
Where the sun and storm clouds meet;
Where the ocean meets that rockwall
Where the boardwalk meets the beach;
Where the prettiest of the maidulas
Leave their legprints in that sand
Just beneath our lovesoaked boardwalk
With the bravest of our lads. Mermaid Avenue that's the street
Where all colors of goodfolks meet;
Where the smokefish meets the pretzel
Where the borscht sounds like the seas;
This is where hot Mexican Chili
Meets Chop Suey and meatballs sweet;
Mermaid Avenue she's a nervous jerk
But, still, she's hard to beat. It's a mighty hard row that my poor hands have hoed
My poor feet have traveled a hot dusty road
Out of your Dust Bowl and Westward we rolled
And your deserts were hot and your mountains were cold I worked in your orchards of peaches and prunes
I slept on the ground in the light of the moon
On the edge of the city you'll see us and then
We come with the dust and we go with the wind California, Arizona, I harvest your crops
Well its North up to Oregon to gather your hops
Dig the beets from your ground, cut the grapes from your vine
To set on your table your light sparkling wine Green pastures of plenty from dry desert ground
From the Grand Coulee Dam where the waters run down
Every state in the Union us migrants have been
We'll work in this fight and we'll fight till we win It's always we rambled, that river and I
All along your green valley, I will work till I die
My land I'll defend with my life if it be
Cause my pastures of plenty must always be free It was sad when that great ship went down
It was sad when that great ship went down
Cold ocean floor must now be your home
It was sad when that great ship went down It was sad when that great ship went down
It was sad when that great ship went down
Cold ocean floor must now be your home
It was sad when that great ship went down It was sad when that great ship went down
Sad when that great ship went down
Cold ocean floor will now be your home
Sad when that great ship went down It was sad when that great ship went down
It was sad when that great ship went down
Cold ocean floor must now be your home
It was sad when that great ship went down Love is the only God that Ill ever believe in. The books of the holy bible never say but one time just exactly what God is, and in those three little words it pours out a hundred million college educations and says, God Is Love. And that is the only real definite answer to ten thousand wild queries and questions that I my own self tossed at my bible. That is the only really sensible, easy, honest, warm, plain, quick and clear answer I found - when I was ready to throw so-called fearful cowardly thieving poisoning religion out my trash door, it was those three words that made not only religion, but also several other sorts of superstitious fears and hatreds in me meet one very quick death. God is Love.
God is really love.
The Great Historical Bum
I'm just a lonesome traveler, The Great Historical Bum.
Highly educated from history I have come.
I built the Rock of Ages, twas in the Year of One
And that was about the biggest thing that man had ever done. I worked in the Garden of Eden, that was the year of two,
Joined the apple pickers union, I always paid my due;
I'm the man that signed the contract to raise the rising sun,
And that was about the biggest thing that man had ever done. I was straw boss on the Pyramids, the Tower of Babel, too;
I opened up the ocean let the migrant children through,
I fought a million battles and I never lost a one,
And that was about the biggest thing that man had ever done. I beat the daring Roman, I beat the daring Turk,
Defeated Nero's army with thirty minutes work,
I fought the greatest leaders and I licked them everyone
And that was about the biggest thing that man had ever done. I stopped old Caesar's Romans, and I stopped the Kubla Khan;
I took but half an hour's work to beat the Pharaoh's bands;
I knocked old Kaiser Bill flat, then I dumped the bloody Huns,
And that's about the biggest thing that man has ever done. I was in the Revolution when we set the country free;
Me and a couple of Indians that dumped the Boston tea;
We won the battle at Valley Forge, the battle of Bully Run;
And that was about the biggest thing that man has ever done. Next, we won the slavery war, some other folks and me,
And every slave from sea to sea was all turned loose by me.
I divorced old Madam slavery, and I wed this freedom dame.
And that's about the biggest thing that man has ever done. And then I took to farming on the great midwestern plain,
The dust it blowed a hundred years, but never come a rain
Well, me and a million other fellas left there on the run
And that was about the biggest thing that man has ever done. I clumb the rocky canyon where the Columbia River rolls,
Seen the salmon leaping the rapids and the falls
The big Grand Coulee Dam in the state of Washington
Is just about the biggest thing that man has ever done. There's a building in New York that you call the Empire State
I rode the rods to Frisco to walk the Golden Gate
I've seen every foot of film that Hollywood has run
But Coulee is the biggest thing that man has ever done. Three times the size of Boulder or the highest pyramid
Makes the Tower of Babel a plaything for a kid
From the rising of the river to the setting of the sun
The Coulee is the biggest thing that man has ever done. There was a man across the ocean, I guess you knew him well,
His name was Adolf Hitler, goddam his soul to hell;
We kicked him in the panzers and put him on the run,
And that was about the biggest thing that man has ever done. I'm living with my freedom wife in this big land we built;
It takes all forty eight States for me to spread my quilt.
Our kids are several millions now; they run from sun to sun.
And that's about the biggest thing that man has ever done. I built mines and mills and factories to run for Uncle Sam;
I turned th ploughs and wheels to feed my soldiers in your lands;
This Nazi job's a tough un, it'll take us everyone,
Cause this is about the biggest thing that man has ever done. There's warehouse guys and teamsters and guys that skin the cats
Guys that run my steel mill, my furnace and my blast
We'll stop the Axis rattlesnakes and thieves of old Nippon
And that will be the biggest thing that man has ever done. I'd better quit my talking, cause I told you all I know,
But please remember, pardner, wherever you may go,
The people are building a peaceful world, and when the job is done
That'll be the biggest thing that man has ever done. I better quit my talking now; I told you all I know,
But please remember, pardner, wherever you may go,
I'm older than your old folks, and I'm younger than the young,
And I'm about the biggest thing that man has ever done. I was standing down New York town one day
I was standing down in New York town one day
I was standing down in that New York town one day
Just singing Hey hey hey hey I was broke and I didn't have a dime
I was broke and I didn't have a lousy dime
I was broke and I didn't have a dime
Every good man gets a little hard luck some time Every good man gets a little hard luck some time
Every good man gets a little hard luck some time
Every good man gets a little hard luck some time
When he's down and out and ain't got a lousy dime What you do woman, that sure don't worry me
What you do woman, Lord, that sure don't worry me
What you do woman, that sure don't worry me
I got more women than the Civil War set free And I can get more women than a passenger train can haul
I can get more women than a passenger train can haul
I can get more women than a passenger train can haul
Just singing Hey hey hey hey I'm gonna ride that new morning railroad
I'm gonna ride that new morning train

Just what you sow To the rich man's bright lodges I ride in this wind
On my good horse I call you my shiny Black Bess
To the playhouse of fortune
to take the bright silver
An gold you have taken from somebody else And as we go riding in the damp foggy midnight
You snort, my good pony, and you give me your best
For you know, and I know, good horse
mongst the rich ones
How oftimes we go there an unwelcome guest I've never took food from the widows and orphans
And never a hard working man I oppressed
So take your pace easy,
for home soon like lightening
We soon will be riding, my shiny Black Bess No fat rich man's pony can ever overtake you
And there's not a rider from the east to the west
Could hold you a light
in this dark mist and midnight
When the potbellied thieves
chase their unwelcome guest I don't know good horse,
As we trot in this dark here
That robbing the rich is for worse or for best
They take it by stealing and lying and gambling
And I take it my way, my shiny Black Bess I treat horses good and I'm friendly to strangers
I ride and your running makes my guns talk the best
And the rangers and deputies
are hired by the rich man
To catch me and hang me, my shining Black Bess Yes, they'll catch me napping one day
and they'll kill me
And then I'll be gone but that won't be my end
For my guns and my saddle will always be filled
By unwelcome travellers and other brave men And they'll take the money and spread it out equal
Just like the Bible and the prophets suggest
But the man that go riding to help these poor workers
The rich will cut down like an unwelcome guest I've got to know, yes, I've got to know, friend;
Hungry lips ask me wherever I go!
Comrades and friends all falling around me
I've got to know, yes, I've got to know. Why do your war boats ride on my waters?
Why do your death bombs fall from my skies?
Why do you burn my farm and my town down?
I've got to know, friend, I've got to know! What makes your boats haul death to my people?
Nitro blockbusters, big cannons and guns?
Why doesn't your ship bring food and some clothing?
I've sure got to know, folks, I've sure got to know! Why can't my two hands get a good pay job?
I can still plow, plant, I can still sow!
Why did your lawbook chase me off my good land?
I'd sure like to know, friend, I've just got to know! What good work did you do, sir, I'd like to ask you,
To give you my money right out of my hands?
I built your big house here to hide from my people,
Why you crave to hide so, I'd love to know! You keep me in jail and you lock me in prison,
Your hospital's jammed and your crazyhouse full,
What made your cop kill my trade union worker?
You'll hafta talk plain cause I sure have to know! Why can't I get work and cash my big paycheck?
Why can't I buy things in your place and your store?
Why do you close my plant down and starve all my buddies?
I'm asking you, sir, cause I've sure got to know! Oh when the Yanks when the Yanks

My number's on my skin.
Old Ilsa Koch is here.
The prisoners walk the grounds.
The hounds have killed a girl.
The guards have shot a man.
Some more have starved to death.
Here comes the prisoner's car.
They dump them in the pen.
They load them down the schute.
The trooper cracks their skulls.
He steals their teeth of gold.
He shoves them on the belt.
He swings that furnace door.
He slides their corpses in.
I see the chimney smoke.
I see their ashes hauled.
I see their bones in piles.
Lamp shades are made from skins.
I'm choking on the smoke.
The stink is killing me.
Old Ilsy Koch was jailed.
Old Ilsy Koch went free.
I've got to hush my song.
Here comes the super man.
I'll see you later on.
I've got to duck and run. On the 14th day of April of 1935,
There struck the worst of dust storms that ever filled the sky.
You could see that dust storm comin, the cloud looked deathlike black,
And through our mighty nation, it left a dreadful track.
From Oklahoma City to the Arizona line,
Dakota and Nebraska to the lazy Rio Grande,
It fell across our city like a curtain of black rolled down,
We thought it was our judgement, we thought it was our doom. The radio reported, we listened with alarm,
The wild and windy actions of this great mysterious storm;
From Albuquerque and Clovis, and all New Mexico,
They said it was the blackest that ever they had saw. From old Dodge City, Kansas, the dust had rung their knell,
And a few more comrades sleeping on top of old Boot Hill.
From Denver, Colorado, they said it blew so strong,
They thought that they could hold out, but they didn't know how long. Our relatives were huddled into their oil boom shacks,
And the children they was cryin as it whistled through the cracks.
And the family it was crowded into their little room,
They thought the world had ended, and they thought it was their doom. The storm took place at sundown, it lasted through the night,
When we looked out next morning, we saw a terrible sight.
We saw outside our window where wheat fields they had grown
Was now a rippling ocean of dust the wind had blown. It covered up our fences, it covered up our barns,
It covered up our tractors in this wild and dusty storm.
We loaded our jalopies and piled our families in,
We rattled down that highway to never come back again. ROLL ON COLUMBIA
by Woody Guthrie
tune Good Night Irene
Roll on, Columbia, roll on
Roll on, Columbia, roll on
Your power is turning our darkness to dawn
So roll on, Columbia, roll on
Green Douglas firs where the waters cut through
Down her wild mountains and canyons she flew
Canadian Northwest to the oceans so blue
Roll on Columbia, roll on
Other great rivers add power to you
Yakima, Snake, and the Klickitat, too
Sandy Willamette and Hood River too
So roll on, Columbia, roll on
Tom Jefferson's vision would not let him rest
An empire he saw in the Pacific Northwest
Sent Lewis and Clark and they did the rest
So roll on, Columbia, roll on
It's there on your banks that we fought many a fight
Sheridan's boys in the blockhouse that night
They saw us in death but never in flight
So roll on Columbia, roll on
At Bonneville now there are ships in the locks
The waters have risen and cleared all the rocks
Shiploads of plenty will steam past the docks
So roll on, Columbia, roll on
And on up the river is Grand Coulee Dam
The mightiest thing ever built by a man
To run the great factories and water the land
So roll on, Columbia, roll on
These mighty men labored by day and by night
Matching their strength gainst the river's wild flight
Through rapids and falls, they won the hard fight
So roll on, Columbia, roll on

At a dollar down and a dollar a week.
Every time he turned the wheel,
It was a dollar down and a dollar a week. He went riding down the road,
Pinched this girl upon her cheek.
Speed cop took him to the judge,
He got a dollar down and a dollar a week. Sixty days he laid in jail,
At a dollar down and a dollar a week,
Another man was a lovin his gal,
At a dollar down and a dollar a week. When he got out he shot the man,
And laid him in the graveyard six feet deep.
And when he bought the graveyard spot,
it was a dollar down and a dollar a week. Ade olay E-E

My Daddy
Well, a curly-headed girl with a bright shining smile

To her playmates she said, with a bright twinkling eye
My Daddy flies that ship in the sky My Daddy flies that ship in the sky
My Daddy flies that ship in the sky
My Mama's not afraid and neither am I
Cause my Daddy flies that ship in the sky Then a button-nosed kid, as he kicked up his heels
He said, My Daddy works in the iron and the steel
My Dad builds the planes and they fly through the sky
And that's what keeps your daddy up there so high That's what keeps your daddy up there so high
That's what keeps your daddy up there so high
My Dad builds the planes and they fly through the sky
And that's what keeps your daddy up there so high Then a freckle-faced kid pinched his toe in the sand
He says, My Daddy works at that place where they land
You tell your mama, don't be afraid

A story I will tell
Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw,
Oklahoma knew him well. It was in the town of Shawnee,
A Saturday afternoon,
His wife beside him in his wagon
As into town they rode. There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude,
Vulgar words of anger,
An his wife she overheard. Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain,
And the deputy grabbed his gun;
In the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down. Then he took to the trees and timber
To live a life of shame;
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name. But a many a starving farmer
The same old story told
How the outlaw paid their mortgage
And saved their little homes. Others tell you bout a stranger
That come to beg a meal,
Underneath his napkin
Left a thousand dollar bill. It was in Oklahoma City,
It was on a Christmas Day,
There was a whole car load of groceries
Come with a note to say: Well, you say that I'm an outlaw,
You say that I'm a thief.
Here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief. Yes, as through this world I've wandered
I've seen lots of funny men;
Some will rob you with a six-gun,
And some with a fountain pen. And as through your life you travel,
Yes, as through your life you roam,
You won't never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their home. Down in the scrub oak timber of the Southeast Texas Gulf
There used to ride a brakeman and a brakeman double tough
He worked the town of Kilgore and Longview nine miles down
Us travelers called him East Texas Red the meanest bull around. I rode by night and by broad daylight in wind and snow and sun
I always seen little East Texas Red sporting his smooth running gun
The tale got switched down the stems and main and everybody said
The meanest man on the shiny rails was little East Texas Red. It was early in the morning and along towards nine or ten
A couple of boys on the hunt of a job stood in the blizzardy wind
Hungry and cold they knocked on the doors of the working folks around
For a piece of meat and a spud or two to boil a stew around. Red he come down the cinder dump and he flagged the number two
He kicked their bucket over a bush and he dumped out all their stew
A traveler said, Mister East Texas Red you better get everything fixed
Cause you're gonna ride your little train just one year from today. Red he laughed as he clumb the bank and swung aside of a wheeler
The boys caught a tanker to Seminole and west to Amarillo
They struck them a job of oil field work and followed a pipe line down
It took them lots of places till the year had rolled around. On one cold and wintery day they hooked them a Gulf bound train
They shivered and shook with dough in their clothes to see Kilgore again
Over hills of sand and hard froze roads where the cotton wagons roll
On past the town of Kilgore and on to old Longview. With their warm suits of clothes and overcoats they walk into a store
They pay the man for some meat and stuff to fix a stew once more
The ties they walk back past the yards till they come to the same old spot
Where East Texas Red just a year ago had dumped their last stew pot. The smoke of their fire went higher and higher a man come down the line
He ducked his head in the blizzardy wind and waved old number nine
He walked off down the cinder dump till he come to the same old spot
And there was the same three men again around that same little pot. Red went to his knees and he hollered,
Please don't pull that trigger on me.
I did not get my business fixed but he did not get his say
A gun wheeled out of an overcoat and it played the old one two
And Red was dead when the other two men set down to eat their stew. I'm a-going down this old dusty road
I'm a-going down this old dusty road
O Lord God
And I ain't gonna be treated this way I'm a-going where the dust storms never blow
I'm a-going where the dust storms never blow
O Lord God
And I ain't gonna be treated this way My children need three square meals a day
My children need three square meals a day
O Lord God
And I ain't gonna be treated this way I'm a-looking for a job and honest pay
I'm a-looking for a job and honest pay
O Lord God
And I ain't gonna be treated this way Two good men a long time gone,
Two good men a long time gone
Two good men a long time gone, oh, gone,
Sacco, Vanzetti a long time gone,
Left me here to sing this song. Say, there, did you hear the news?
Sacco worked at trimming shoes;
Vanzetti was a peddling man,
Pushed his fish cart with his hands. Sacco was born across the sea
Somewhere over in Italy;
Vanzetti was born of parents fine,
Drank the best Italian wine. Sacco sailed the sea one day,
Landed up in Boston Bay;
Vanzetti sailed the ocean blue,
Landed up in Boston, too. Sacco's wife three children had,
Sacco was a family man;
Vanzetti was a dreaming man,
His book was always in his hand. Sacco earned his bread and butter
Being the factory's best shoe cutter;
Vanzetti spoke both day and night,
Told the workers how to fight. I'll tell you if you ask me
Bout this payroll robbery;
Two clerks was killed by the shoe factory
On the street in South Braintree. Judge Thayer told his friends around
He would cut the radicals down;
Anarchist bastards was the name
Judge Thayer called these two good men. I'll tell you the prosecutors names,
Katsman, Adams, Williams, Kane;
The judge and lawyers strutted down,
They done more tricks than circus clowns. Vanzetti docked here in 1908;
He slept along the dirty streets,
He told the workers Organize 
And on the electric chair he dies. All you people ought to be like me,
And work like Sacco and Vanzetti;
And every day find some ways to fight
On the union side for workers rights. I've got no time to tell this tale,
The dicks and bulls are on my trail;
But I'll remember these two good men
That died to show me how to live. All you people in Suassos Lane
Sing this song and sing it plain.
All you folks that's coming along,
Jump in with me, and sing this song. It was late last night I made my rounds
I met my woman and I blowed her down
I went on home and I went to bed
I laid my pistol up under my head Early next morning, by the rising sun
I woke up and a started to run
I made a run but I run too slow
A man overtook me down in Jericho I was standing on the corner reading my daddy's will
Long came a man they call him Bad Texas Bill
He said, Uhh, Captain, is your name Lee Brown?
I believe that you the rascal blowed yer woman down I said, Yes sir, Captain, my name is Lee
And if you got any blues boy sing em to me 
 Well I guess Lee, that you know the best
You better come with me the judge will tell you the rest When I was arrested I was dressed in black
Put me on a train and they brung me back
Jury found me guilty in the first degree
And they laid me down in the penitentiary Yes, the judge found me guilty and the jury too
I cried, Lord in Heaven, have some mercy on me 
I'll be here for the rest of my life
All I done was kill my wife I've sung this song, but I'll sing it again,
Of the place that I lived on the wild windy plains,
In the month called April, county called Gray,
And here's what all of the people there say: So long, it's been good to know yuh;
So long, it's been good to know yuh;
So long, it's been good to know yuh.
This dusty old dust is a-gettin my home,
And I got to be driftin along. A dust storm hit, an it hit like thunder;
It dusted us over, an it covered us under;
Blocked out the traffic an blocked out the sun,
Straight for home all the people did run,
Singin: We talked of the end of the world, and then
We'd sing a song an then sing it again.
We'd sit for an hour an not say a word,
And then these words would be heard: Sweethearts sat in the dark and sparked,
They hugged and kissed in that dusty old dark.
They sighed and cried, hugged and kissed,
Instead of marriage, they talked like this:
 Honey, Now, the telephone rang, an it jumped off the wall,
That was the preacher, a-makin his call.
He said, Kind friend, this may the end;
An you got your last chance of salvation of sin! The churches was jammed, and the churches was packed,
An that dusty old dust storm blowed so black.
Preacher could not read a word of his text,
An he folded his specs, an he took up collection,
Said: This morning I was born again and a light shines on my land
I no longer look for heaven in your deathly distant land
I do not want your pearly gates don't want your streets of gold
This morning I was born again and a light shines on my soul This morning I was born again, I was born again complete
I stood up above my troubles and I stand on my two feet
My hand it feels unlimited, my body feels like the sky
I feel at home in the universe where yonder planets fly This I was born again, my past is dead and gone
This great eternal moment is my great eternal dawn
Each drop of blood within me, each breath of life I breathe
Is united with these mountains and the mountains with the seas I feel the sun upon me, it's rays crawl through my skin
I breathe the life of Jesus and old John Henry in
I give myself, my heart, my soul to give some friend a hand
This morning I was born again, I am in the promised land This morning I was born again and a light shines on my land
I no longer look for heaven in your deathly distant land
I do not want your pearly gates don't want your streets of gold
And I do not want your mansion for my heart is never cold. Went up on the mountain
Just to give my horn a blow
Thought I heard my true love say
Yonder comes my beau ,
Bile them Cabbage down
Turn them hoecakes round
The only song that I can sing
Is bile them cabbage down Took my gal to the blacksmith shop
To have her mouth made small
She turned around a time or two
And swallowd shop and all , Possum in a Simmon tree
Raccoon on the ground
Raccoon says you son-of-a-gun
Shake some Simmon's down , Someone stole my old coon dog
Wish they'd bring him back
He chased the big hogs through the fence
And the little ones through the crack , Met a possum in the road
Blind as he could be
Jumped the fence and whipped my dog
And bristled up at me , Once I had an old gray mule
His name was Simon Slick
He'd roll his eyes and back his ears
And how that mule would kick , How that mule would kick
He kicked with his dying breath
He shoved his hind feet down his throat
And kicked himself to death , I didn't promise you skies painted blue
Not all colored flowers all your days through
I didn't promise you, sun with no rain
Joys without sorrows, peace without pain. All that I promise is strength for this day,
Rest for my worker, and light on your way.
I give you truth when you need it, my help from above,
Undying friendship, my unfailing love. I never did promise you crowns without trials,
Food with no hard sweat, your tears without smiles,
Hot sunny days without cold wintry snows,
No victory without fightin, no laughs without woes. All that I promise is strength for this day,
Rest for my, worker, my light on your way,
I give you truth when you need it, my help from above,
Undying friendship, my unfailing love. I sure didn't say I'd give you heaven on earth,
A life with no labor no struggles no deaths,
No earthquakes no dryspells, no fire flames no droughts,
No slaving no hungers, no blizzards no blights. All that I promise is strength for this day,
Rest for my worker, my light on your way,
I give you truth when you need it, my help from above,
Undying friendship, my unfailing love. I promise you power, this minute this hour,
The power you need when you fall down to bleed,
I give you my peace, and my strength to pull home
My love for all races all creeds and all kinds. My flavors my saviors my creeds of all kinds,
My love for my saviors, all colors all kinds,
My love for my races all creeders all kinds,
My saviors my flavors my dancers all kinds,
My dancers my prancers my singers all kinds,
My flavors my saviors my dancers all kinds. Wake up, wake up, wake up.

Through the wild and windy weather, the sun and sleet and rain,
Comes a-whistlin through the country this Farmer-Labor train. Listen to the jingle and the rumble and the roar,
She's rollin through New England to the West Pacific shore.
It's a long time we've been waitin, now she's been whistlin round the bend,
Roll on into Congress on that Farmer-Labor train. There's lumberjacks and teamsters and sailors from the sea,
There's farmin boys from Texas and the hills of Tennessee,
There's miners from Kentucky, there's fishermen from Maine;
Every worker in the country rides that Farmer-Labor train. There's warehouse boys and truckers and guys that skin the cats,
Men that run the steel mills, the furnace and the blast,
Through the smoky factory cities, over the hot and dusty plains,
And the cushions they are crowded, on this Farmer-Labor train. Listen to the jingle and the rumble and the roar,
She's rollin through New England to the West Pacific shore.
It's a long time we've been waitin, now she's been whistlin round the bend,
Ride on on into Congress on that Farmer-Labor train. There's folks of every color and they're ridin side by side
Through the swamps of Louisiana and across the Great Divide,
From the wheat fields and the orchards and the lowing cattle range,
And they're rolling onto victory on this Farmer-Labor train. This train pulled into Washington a bright and happy day,
When she steamed into the station you could hear the people say:
 There's that Farmer-Labor Special, she's full of union men
Headin onto White House on the Farmer-Labor train. My mother called me to her bedside
These words she said to me
If you don't quit your rambling ways
They're gonna get you in the penetentiary
Gonna get you in the penetentiary poor boy
Gonna get you in the penetentiary
If you don't quit your reckless ways
They're gonna get you in the penetentiary So I sat myself down in a gambling game
But I could not play my hand
Just thinking about that woman I love
Run away with another man
Run away with another man poor boy
Run away with another man
Just thinking about that woman I love
Run away with another man The cards came around the table lord
And I had such a worried mind
My stack of gold dollars I wasted away
And I lost about ninety-nine
I lost about ninety-nine poor boy
I lost about ninety-nine
My stack of gold dollars I wasted away
And I lost about ninety-nine It wasn't very long till I seen him again
He ran away left her behind
And I laid him down with my old forty-four
And the judge gave me ninety-nine
The judge gave me ninety-nine poor boy
The judge gave me ninety-nine
I laid a man down with my big forty-four
And the judge gave me ninety-nine Well the jury said I had to pay
And the clerk he wrote it down
And the judge called out my number
Two sixes upside down
Two sixes upside down poor boy
Two sixes upside down
The judge called out my number
Two sixes upside down Way out in Reno, Nevada,
Where romance blooms and fades,
A great Philadelphia lawyer
Was in love with a Hollywood maid. Come, love, and we'll go ramblin
Down where the lights are so bright.
I'll win you a divorce from your husband,
And we can get married tonight. Wild Bill was a gun-totin cowboy,
Ten notches were carved in his gun.
And all the boys around Reno
Left Wild Bill's maiden alone. One night when Bill was returning
From ridin the range in the cold,
He dreamed of his Hollywood sweetheart,
Her love was as lasting as gold. As he drew near her window,
Two shadows he saw on the shade;
Twas the great Philadelphia lawyer
Makin love to Bill's Hollywood maid. The night was as still as the desert,
The moon hangin high overhead.
Bill listened awhile through the window,
He could hear every word that he said: Your hands are so pretty and lovely,
Your form's so rare and divine.
Come go with me to the city
And leave this wild cowboy behind. Now tonight back in old Pennsylvania,
Among those beautiful pines,
There's one less Philadelphia lawyer
In old Philadelphia tonight. Open your hearts to the paradise,
To the peace of the heavenly angels,
Takes away that woeful shadow dancing on your wall;
Take to the skies of peace, oh friends,
Of peace of the heavenly Father;
Get ready for my bugle call of peace. CHORUS:
Peace, peace, peace, peace, peace, peace, peace.
I can hear the bugle sounding,
Roaming around my land, my city and my town;
Peace, peace, peace, peace, peace, peace, peace.
I can hear the horn and voices ring louder,
While my bugle calls for peace. Thick war clouds will throw its shadows,
Darkening the world around you,
But in my life of peace your dark illusions fall;
Think and pray my union way,
Kiss everybody around you;
Get ready for my bugle call of peace.
CHORUS
If these war storms fill your heart
With a thousand kinds of worry,
Keep to my road of peace, you'll never have to fear;
Keep in the sun and look around
In the face of peace and plenty;
Get ready for my bugle call of peace.
CHORUS
I'll clear my house of the weeds of fear
And turn to the friends around me,
With my smile of peace, I'll greet you one and all;
I'll work, I'll fight, I'll sing and dance,
Of peace of the youthful spirit;
Get ready for my bugle call of peace.
CHORUS
Many a month has come and gone
Since I wandered from my home
In those Oklahoma hills where I was born.
Many a page of life has turned,
Many a lesson I have learned;
Well, I feel like in those hills I still belong. Way down yonder in the Indian Nation
Ridin my pony on the reservation,
In those Oklahoma hills where I was born.
Now, way down yonder in the Indian Nation,
A cowboy's life is my occupation,
In those Oklahoma hills where I was born. But as I sit here today,
Many miles I am away
From a place I rode my pony through the draw,
While the oak and blackjack trees
Kiss the playful prairie breeze,
In those Oklahoma hills where I was born. Now as I turn life a page
To the land of the great Osage
In those Oklahoma hills where I was born,
While the black oil it rolls and flows
And the snow-white cotton grows
In those Oklahoma hills where I was born. I'd like to rest my heavy head tonight
On a bed of California stars
I'd like to lay my weary bones tonight
On a bed of California stars
I'd love to feel your hand touching mine
And ell me why i must keep working on
Yes, I'd give my life to lay my head tonight
On a bed of California stars I'd like to dream my troubles all away
On a bed of California stars
Jump up from my starbed and make another day
Underneath my California stars
They hang like grapes on vines that shine
And warm the lovers glass like friendly wine
So, I'd give this world just to dream a dream with you
On our bed of California stars It was late last night when the boss came home askin for his lady
The only answer that he got, 
She's gone with the Gypsy Davey,
She's gone with the Gypsy Dave. Go saddle for me a buckskin horse
And a hundred dollar saddle.
Point out to me their wagon tracks
And after them I'll travel,
After them I'll ride. Well I had not rode to the midnight moon,
When I saw the campfire gleaming.
I heard the notes of the big guitar
And the voice of the gypsies singing
That song of the Gypsy Dave. There in the light of the camping fire,
I saw her fair face beaming.
Her heart in tune with the big guitar
And the voice of the gypsies singing
That song of the Gypsy Dave. Have you forsaken your house and home?
Have you forsaken your baby?
Have you forsaken your husband dear
To go with the Gypsy Davy?
And sing with the Gypsy Davy?
The song of the Gypsy Dave? Yes I've forsaken my husband dear
To go with the Gypsy Davy,
And I've forsaken my mansion high
But not my blue-eyed baby,
Not my blue-eyed baby. She smiled to leave her husband dear
And go with the Gypsy Davy;
But the tears come a-trickling down her cheeks
To think of the blue-eyed baby,
Pretty little blue-eyed baby. Take off, take off your buckskin gloves
Made of Spanish leather;
Give to me your lily-white hair
And we'll ride home together
We'll ride home again. No, I won't take off my buckskin gloves,
They're made of Spanish leather.
I'll go my way from day to day
And sing with the Gypsy Davy
That song of the Gypsy Davy,
That song of the Gypsy Davy,
That song of the Gypsy Dave. Hey lolly lolly lolly
hey lolly lolly lolly low A married man will keep your secret
a single boy will talk about you A playin man will keep your secret
a quiet man will talk about you Well, a married man's an easy rider
a single boy gets all excited Single boy walks up and down the street
Married man's in his stockin feet There is a house in this old town,
And that's where my true love lays around.
And he takes other women right down on his knee
And he tells them a little tale he won't tell me. It's a-hard and it's hard, ain't it hard
To love one that never did love you?
It's a-hard, and it's hard, ain't it hard, great God,
To love one that never will be true? First time I seen my true love
He was walkin by my door.
The next time I saw his false hearted smile
He was layin dead and cold on floor. Well, who's goin to kiss your ruby lips,
And who's goin to hold you to his breast?
And who will talk your future over
While I'm out ramblin in the West? Don't go to drinkin or to gamblin,
Don't go there your sorrows to drown.
