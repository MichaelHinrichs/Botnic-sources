Free Christmas Plays for Children "The Birth of Jesus"
"The Birth of Jesus" Script for Children's Christmas Pageant

Here is a simple kids Christmas skit for church. You can download, print, and use with your children’s choir. Like all our resources this is 100% free for you to use in your children’s ministry. This pageant is written directly from the Bible, only adding songs and direction for the actors. There are no speaking parts for the actors, only a narrator. The narration is indicated by being in italics. Please leave a comment below with any suggestions or to let us know how you used our Christmas play in your church. You can also check out our other free Christmas plays.

Ages: This pageant has been used with a preschool ages 1-5 year olds as well as a children’s church ages 2 – 5th grade.

Costumes: These can be as simple or as extravagant as you want them to be. We have used large t-shirts for all of the children (in different colors) when we were on a very little budget. The first year, we didn’t even have a budget, so we asked all of the parents to donate a large t-shirt (they were more than happy to do that). We have also bought cheap white flat sheets, had the children watercolor on them and then cut them up for all of the head dresses. Yarn can be braided to make belts, cardboard can be cut and painted for wings, tree glitter garland can be used to make halos and Burger King still has crowns! Be creative and have the children help make their costumes!

Props: Just like the costumes, can be as simple or as extravagant as you want them to be. We have used large cardboard boxes and sheets to cover up the equipments on the stage with a simple “Bethlehem” sign. Don’t forget Baby Jesus!!!

Songs: We used a the Cedarmount Kids CD with children’s voices, but you can use any music that fits your congregation.  We gave the Sunday School teachers a CD with the just the songs that the children will be singing so that they could practice. We played the CD with the children’s voices with our children singing. We have done this with 60 1-5 year olds and 30 2 year old-5th graders and we could ALWAYS hear our children over the CD. It just helped our children feel more confident in their singing if we played the CD with the voices. Don’t worry about not being able to hear your children.

Narration: We opted to have a person in the balcony with a microphone, over pre-taping the narration. This way, she could watch the children and make sure that they were in their places before she went on. This also gave something for the children to look at when they got nervous.

Direction: Someone stood beside the Narrator to help remind the children where they were to go. We also had helpers on both sides of the church to help the children down the aisles.

Practices: Since we gave the CD to the Sunday School teachers for the children to practice the singing during class on Sundays, we didn’t need to practice much. We gave the narrator their parts about a month early so that they were comfortable with them and we had the children (who had individual moving parts) practice during class. This helped us only need 1 dress rehearsal on a Saturday morning for 2 hours. We were able to run through the pageant 2 times and then have Happy Birthday, Jesus party to celebrate afterwards!

Just remember, the parents are looking at their child and how great they are up on stage! Our goal is to share the Good News of Jesus’ Birth with others!

Christmas Play Script
** As the parents are entering, play a Christmas CD for background music.

CHILDREN’S MINISTER WELCOMES THE PARENTS AND STARTS WITH AN OPENING PRAYER

“Oh Little Town of Bethlehem” will be playing in the background.

Registrar will walk to stage right
Innkeeper will walk to stage left

In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. And everyone went to his own town to register.

Joseph and Mary walk on stage to the Registrar

So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.

Joseph and Mary walk across the stage to the Innkeeper

While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.

Innkeeper shakes head “no”

Joseph and Mary walk to center stage, sit in chairs and pull out baby Jesus from underneath one of the chairs.

“It Came Upon A Midnight Clear” will be playing in the background.
?Main Angel will come in and stand stage left
Shepherds (and sheep) come in and stand (kneel) in front of angel

And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord.”

All children on stage will sing “Away in a Manger”

“Hark the Herald Angels Sing” will be playing in the background.

Angels will come in and stand with the Main Angel

Suddenly a great company of heavenly hosts appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests.”

Shepherds go see Jesus

So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them.

All on stage will sing “Joy to the World”

Angels, Registrar and Innkeeper will sit down
King will go where the Angels were

“We Three Kings” will be playing in the background

Wisemen and Star Holder will go to see the King

After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, Wise Men from the east came to Jerusalem and asked, “Where is the one who has been born the king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.” Jesus was a king for all people and one day every knee will bow before him.

Stars come in and stand in front

All on stage will sing “Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star”

Stars will sit down on stage
Star holder will walk over and hold the star over Mary and Joseph
Wisemen will walk slowly over to Mary and Joseph

After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was.

Wisemen bow down to baby Jesus and give their gifts

On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshipped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh.

All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: “The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel” which means,…

“God with us.” (all children will say with narrator)

Scene One
CHRISTMAS FX 2010  OLD DUDES SCRIPT   
 
At the end of “Joy to the World” the worship director will ask the audience to be
seated. The praise team will file out. Pablo will be the last one 
feet behind the last person. As he is getting close to the exit he will hear the old
men starting to make noise. He will pause, look back like he is puzzled. Start to
leave again and hear them louder this time. He will turn around this time and
walk back to the middle of the stage still looking puzzled. Will turn and look at the
audience with questioning look like he is trying to figure out where the noise is
coming from, what’s going on, etc.
John: (from behind stage)  you hear all that noise out there?
Bill: (from behind stage) The noise? Well, what about the smell. It smells like a
bunch of sour notes out there!
John: (from behind stage)  it s interrupting our game of checkers. Let’s go see what’s going on out there.
Bill: (from behind stage)  I get on my electric scooter? John: s just take a look from the balcony first.
John: Hey, look at the dude with the Goofy mask on!
Bill: (peers more closely) That’s not a s his real face!
John:  dude!
Laugh together
Pablo: Excuse me?
John: Listen you young whippersnapper! We’re trying to play a game of checkers back here! You need to quit making all that racket!
Pablo: It’s not racket! It’s a Christmas show with singing and dancing.
 Lights come on balcony. Old men appear /John has glasses and Bill doesn’t.
 They look around and then spot Pablo as he also spots them.
Bill: A show? Is that what you’re calling it?
John: I know what’s wrong with this show. The seats are all facing toward the
stage!
Laugh together
Pablo: ve been a successful singer for over half my life!
Bill: Then why’d we get stuck with this half!
Laugh together / Pablo shakes head
John:  know what your problem is?
Pablo:  is it?
John: You’re too close to the audience!
Bill:  up some!
Pablo hesitates
Bill: Go  up some.
Pablo takes 3-4 steps backwards
Pablo: Is this better?
John: No. You need to go back further.
Pablo takes few more steps back.
Pablo: Am I far enough from the audience now?
Bill: You gotta’ car!
Laugh together!
Pablo walks back to original place while shaking his head.
John: Here’s a tip for you. Instead of singing, maybe you should try making a movie. You could call it “Revenge of the Dork!”
Laugh together!

Pablo: I am trying to respect my elders but you guys are making it tough! Bill:  want us to help you out?
Pablo: That would be nice.
John: We’ll be glad to help you out. Which way did you come in?
Laugh together
Pablo: Well at least the skit was good.
Bill: d call that a medium skit!
Pablo: A medium skit?
Bill:  wasn’t rare and it wasn’t well done.
Laugh together
Pablo:  guys are making me really upset! I’m going to have to ask the ushers to take you out of the auditorium.
John: The ushers can’t take us out of the auditorium. Pablo: And why not!
John: They’re too busy trying to keep people in! Laugh together
Pablo: (stuttering and getting angry) s...
John: (interrupting) Looks like to me he’s getting pretty desperate up here!
Bill:  he will panic and run away!
Laugh together
John: Well, maybe we should just... (starts moving mouth with no words coming out)
Bill looks at John and starts tapping his ear
Bill: What? What are you saying? I can’t hear you! Looks like I need some new batteries for my hearing aid!
     
John:  him every time!
Pablo starts laughing really loud.
Bill: What are you laughing at! I’m not feeling very well over here!
Pablo: Oh, I’m sorry. What’s wrong?
Bill: Well, it’s either indigestion or this show. And I hope it’s indegestion.
Pablo: Why?
Bill: Because then it will get better after a little while.
Laugh together
John: Well, we better leave this young whipper snapper to his show and go finish our game of checkers.
Bill: Just remember to keep it down out here!
John: Hey, guess what I’m getting you for Christmas this year?
Bill: What?
John: A  you’re bald on top it’s a gift you’ll never part with!
John Laughs
Bill: You won’t be laughing when I finish beating you in this chess game, you old crusty!
         
 Pablo shakes head and walks off as the old dudes go back behind stage. Lights
 fade down. You can hear them talking backstage like they are leaving.
 
Scene Two
John: ve watched the  unlock the doors! Laugh together.
Bill: I actually liked that last number.
John: Why?
Bill: Because it was the last number! Laugh together.
John:  when you think this show is terrible something  ends!
Laugh together.
Bill: It was certainly a show to remember.
John: Why?
Bill: I forgot!
Laugh together!
John: I wonder why they didn’t sing the parent’s favorite song?
Bill: What is it?
John: Silent night!
Laugh together.
Bill: Well, do you know what Adam said on the day before Christmas? John: What?
Bill: It’s Christmas, Eve.
Laugh together!
  Soon as person on stage dismisses crowd they appear again in the balcony and
 light comes on them.
    
John: Ha! Ha! That was a good one!
John: I think I heard something about Christmas cookies after the show. Do you
know the best thing to put into a Christmas cookie? Bill: What?
John: Your teeth!
Laugh together.
Bill: (laughing)  gotta’ stop!
John: What does a reindeer do when he loses his tail? Bill: (still laughing)
John: He goes to a retail shop and buys another one!
Bill: (still laughing hard)  gotta let up! I’m dying over here! Let me tell you one. Did you know the three wise men wore fire helmets when they came to see Jesus?
John: That’s not true!
Bill: It’s in the Bible. It says they came from “afar” to see Jesus! Laugh together.
John:  to call it a night?
Bill:  certainly wouldn’t call it a show!
Laugh together as turn and start leaving.
John: (as leaving) Are you coming next time?
Bill: (from behind stage)  I get lucky and break a leg! Laugh together.

Planning a Christmas play takes a lot of work and commitment but even the best-laid plans are subject to change when kids get involved. How many times have you held a month of rehearsals (or more) only to have five new kids show up the week before the big event? It has happened to me more than once. The worst-case scenario is lines to a core group then having absent spaces at the play’s premiere. (Been there too!)  Sending a frightened, unprepared child out on stage seems a bit mean.

I gave up the complicated Christmas plays with the expensive backdrops and choreographed dances. (I do tend to do things big.) Experience has taught me a few things about Christmas plays. Number one: keep it simple! (This is lesson two through ten, too.) Stick with what you know and most of all have fun.

Lead the angels. Invest in a few inexpensive instruments like bells, tambourines or drums and lead an angel band. It’s easy for kids to tap and jingle along to recorded songs. It doesn’t take a lot of practice and parents don’t mind if kids are off beat. Another idea that I’ve used is an angel choir. Make garland halos and let children hold battery-operated candles while they sing, “O Come All Ye Faithful.”

Host a Christmas variety show. Instead of planning a play, offer 2 to 3 minutes spots in a Christmas variety show. Of course, you’ll have to review the acts before Christmas, just in case a mini-Elvis impersonator needs some instruction. (Yes, this happened to me.) Create an itinerary and use slide shows and adult performers to fill in blanks.

Narrate the Nativity Story. When in doubt, stick to the gospel of Matthew or Luke. Narrate the nativity story or assign someone the narration part. Kids can act out the parts without learning any lines.

Rely on teens to help you. Never underestimate the power of a teen’s influence over a child. I have found that kids sometimes resist getting on stage; teens can really help a child overcome a case of nerves.

Follow Charlie Brown’s example. Charles Schultz left the world a wonderful gift. A Charlie Brown Christmas is one of the most viewed Christmas programs still to this day. Download the soundtrack and select a few songs from the CD to act out. Charlie Brown delivers the gospel message in a fun, special way.

(Children & Mom are decorating their house for Christmas)

Mom: OK Kids! Are you ready to get the house ready for Christmas?

Sandy: I love getting ready for Christmas!

Susie: It’s my favorite time of the year!

Sally: It makes me get in the mood for Christmas.

Sammy: Yeah, I guess.

Stanley: This stuff just fills up the house and gets in my way.

Mom: Girls, I’m so glad you are excited about it. But you have to remember that this “stuff”, as Stanley put it, means something as well.

Sandy: What do you mean, Mom?

Mom: Why do we celebrate Christmas?

Susie: It’s Jesus’ birthday!

Sally: It’s when we remember that Jesus came into this world as a baby.

Mom: That’s right.

Sammy: Why do we have to decorate then?

Stanley: Yeah, why do we have to fill up our house with all this stuff?

Mom: Well, let’s talk about some of this “stuff” and what it all means. Let’s start with the evergreen tree that we are decorating.

Reader 1: An evergreen tree has a very appropriate name. It is ever green – always green. It does not become dormant in the winter as other trees do. The color green represents new life and the needles of the evergreen always point up – heavenward. It symbolizes our everlasting life with Jesus Christ. We should be as the evergreen tree – always full of life, never becoming dormant in our life with Christ as our arms are lifted heavenward. “The bread of God is the One who comes down from heaven. He gives life to the world.” John 6:33

Sandy: I didn’t realize.

Susie: Wow, I didn’t either.

Sally: I just thought it was a tree.

Sammy: Yeah, I didn’t know that it meant something.

Stanley: What does this other stuff mean?

Mom: How about the ornaments?

Reader 2: Ornaments are used to decorate Christmas trees each and every year. People look for the perfect ones to fit on their tree. Our Christmas tree just would seem complete without our ornaments. Ornaments can symbolize the blessings in our lives. Our lives just wouldn’t be complete without God’s blessings. Everything that we have is due to God loving us so much that He wants to shower us with His blessings. Just as ornaments are all different shapes and sizes, blessings are all different as well. God picks and chooses each blessing for us so that it will be just right. The next time you decorate your tree, and as you put up each ornament, think of a blessing that God has given you. I think you’ll find that you’ll run out of ornaments before you can run out of blessings! “Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD your God that He has given you.” Deuteronomy 16:17

Sandy: Blessings!

Susie: We have so many blessings.

Sally: We have our home and our family.

Sammy: It’s hard to think of all of the blessings that God has given us.

Stanley: Ok, so I guess that’s not so bad. And it does look nice.

Mom: Oh, there’s so much more. How about we talk about the lights and candles.

Reader 3: Lights and candles are used to give light. When a room is full of darkness, it is dark. But, if you light a single match in a dark room, the room is light. There may be more darkness, but the light overpowers it. We are that light. We can be the single light in a world of darkness. We must share our light with the world so that the light increases. “You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.” Matthew 5:14-15

Sandy: I love the lights!

Susie: They’re so pretty!

Sally: Let’s put more lights on.

Sammy: I never knew.

Stanley: I guess I never looked at it that we are the lights for God.

Mom: Exactly. Let’s put these bells on the tree next.

Reader 4: The bell rings out to guide the lost sheep back to the fold, signifying that all are precious in the eyes of the Lord. Jesus is our shepherd and He laid down His life for us so that we may spend eternity with Him in heaven. He is calling us to follow Him through His Word. Are you going to listen? “If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leaven the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray?” Matthew 18:12 “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.” John 10:11

Sandy: The bells sound so beautiful.

Susie: I just love to listen to them.

Sally: Jesus is our shepherd.

Sammy: We are His sheep.

Stanley: He would go looking for me.

Mom: Who likes candy canes?

All Children: ME!

Mom: Let’s put these on next.

Reader 1: The Candy Cane symbolizes multiple things. If you hold it upright…it looks like a shepherd’s crook. The shepherds were some of the few people who were able to see the baby Jesus in Bethlehem. If you turn the candy cane upside down…it looks like a “J”. Jesus starts with the letter “J”. The colors of the candy cane are also symbolic. The red represents the blood that Jesus shed for us on the cross and the white represents the purity of Jesus. There are candy canes with three small red stripes running around it. These stripes symbolize the Trinity – God the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit. Who knew that this delicious simple candy was so profoundly symbolic of our Lord Jesus Christ and His simple birth? “And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS, for He will save His people from their sins.” Matthew 1:21

Sandy: These are delicious!

Susie: I love this part of Christmas.

Sally: It means so many things.

Sammy: There seems to be a reason why we do everything that we do.

Stanley: I can see now how this “stuff” has meaning.

Mom: I’m so glad that you are changing your mind about some of these things. I have some stars to put on the tree next.

Reader 2: The star is a heavenly sign of prophecy fulfilled ages ago, the shining hope for all mankind. The star led the wise men to find the baby Jesus. These wise men traveled many miles following a star in the sky. The star was their “guiding light” to the Savior. God was the wise men’s travel agent, in sorts, leading them to the greatest destination known to man – the Savior. We now have His Word as our “guiding light” to lead us to be with Him in heaven. Are you going to follow Him? “And behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.” Matthew 2:9b-10

Sandy: I like that the star was their “guiding light”.

Susie: They were able to follow the star to Jesus.

Sally: That must have been an amazing journey.

Sammy: I’m glad that we have the Bible now to help lead us.

Stanley: Yes, God’s Word leads us to Jesus.

Mom: Well, I think our tree it almost finished. We just have to put the angel on top.

Reader 3: Imagine…you are a lowly shepherd, watching over your sheep. This night seems no different than any other. Then all of a sudden an angel of the Lord is in the sky above you…telling you of the Savior’s birth. You, a shepherd? Why did God send an angel to tell shepherds? Because the message that God had about the birth of Jesus was for all people! Not just for the right, not just for the Jew…EVERYONE! God chose His #1 messenger to tell the lowest of people (in the world’s eyes) of His Son’s birth! God looks at the heart – not what the world looks at – thank goodness! “And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone ‘round about them: and they were so afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.” Luke 2:9-11

Sandy: Our tree looks beautiful!

Susie: I wouldn’t change anything.

Sally: The angel was like a messenger of God.

Sammy: The angel told the Good News of Jesus’ birth.

Stanley: Wow! I didn’t know. But what about all the other “stuff” that we put around the house.

Mom: Well, Stanley. Let’s talk about this holly that we’re going to put on the table.

Reader 4: We see holly as decorations during the Christmas season. But do we really understand what holly stands for? The leaves represent the crown of thorns that were placed upon Jesus’ head as He was being crucified. The berries symbolize the blood that He shed for us. He endured criticism, excruciating pain, and embarrassment…all for you and I. The next time you see a decoration with holly on it, remember what was done for you so that He could spend eternity with you. I know that I will. “And twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on His head and put a reed in His right hand. And kneeling before Him, they mocked Him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” Matthew 27:29

Sandy: That’s amazing what He did for us.

Susie: It makes me feel blessed to know Him.

Sally: He went through all of that for me!

Sammy: He came to this earth in order to die for me and you.

Stanley: That’s quite an amazing thing to think about during this Christmas season.

Mom: That leads us to this wreath that we’ll hang on the door.

Reader 1: The wreath has its evergreen branches bent in a circle so that the ends touch, having no beginning or end, just as there is no beginning or end of Jesus’ eternal love for us. Just as the wreath looks the same throughout and seems to not change, so He will always be the same. “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.” Hebrews 13:8

Sandy: I just love how it looks on our door.

Susie: Yes, it really finishes off the look of the room.

Sally: It’s nice to know that He will never change.

Sammy: I didn’t realize that it had a meaning.

Stanley: That’s a great reminder that even though we change and grow, He’ll always be right there. Now what about the presents? Those can’t have a meaning.

Mom: Well, you will be surprised then.

Reader 2: These days, the world has forgotten the reason for Christmas. Most people seem to think that getting presents is the greatest thing about Christmas. Other people seem to think that presents have nothing to do with Christmas. Well, they are both wrong. The wise men came to visit Jesus as a young child and gave Him presents. They have His gold, frankincense, and myrrh. They offered Him hold, as a king, paying Him tribute; frankincense, as God, for they honored God with the smoke of incense; and myrrh, as a man that should die, for myrrh was used in embalming dead bodies. These men…these wise men…saw this child and knew that He is a king, is God, and that He would die for the sins of the world. How can anyone, with the knowledge that we have now, not believe? “The Wise Men went to the house. There they saw the child with Hid mother Mary. They bowed down and worshipped Him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave Him gold, incense, and myrrh.” Matthew 2:11

Sandy: I love to get presents!

Susie: I didn’t know that was the reason we give gifts.

Sally: But, Jesus is really the greatest gift to us all.

Sammy: He truly is.
Stanley: I never knew that the wise men’s gifts had meanings. What about the wrapping? That’s just something that we came up with, right?

Mom: Yes, and no. The bows and ribbons do have a special meaning that would be good for us to remember.

Reader 3: Many people spend hours wrapping all of their presents during Christmas time. They use ribbons, garland, and bows to make sure that their presents are as beautiful as possible. What they don’t realize is that the items that they use to complete the outside of the gift have more meaning than the actually gift inside. The bow ties our present with a beautiful ribbon, just as Jesus ties us as Christians together in His love. We may not be in the same family, but we are all in the family of God. Jesus is the ribbon that binds us together. “And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.” Colossians 3:14

Sandy: I just thought the wrappings were to hide the present inside.

Susie: Yea, I never thought about them having their own meaning.

Sally: There’s really a lot to think about.

Sammy: I guess I’ll have to look at things differently.

Stanley: That’s for sure. I never knew that all of this “stuff” had meaning.

Mom: People do get a little crazy with the “stuff” of Christmas. The parties, the gift-giving, the “busy-ness” of the Christmas season. What we need to do is slow down and enjoy every moment by remembering the true meaning of Christmas. Who wants a cookie?

Stanley: I know there’s not a meaning in the cookie.

Mom: Oh, you’d be surprised.

Reader 4: Making cookies is a favorite pastime for most families during the Christmas season. Cookie cutters are used to turn ordinary dough into edible masterpieces. God doesn’t use cookie cutters when He creates each one of us. He makes every one of us so special and unique that He would have to break the mold after just one use. He is the potter and we are His clay. He wants to mold us into His masterpieces. We only need to be moldable and willing to follow His lead. “Behold, like the clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel.” Jeremiah 18:6

Christmas in Genesis? How could this be?
Narrator: Long, Long, Long time ago was nothing.. close your eyes and see nothing.. Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God created….everything! Then he created man and woman. Everything went fine for a while and then It happened! Satan, the devil told the lady if she ate the fruit from the tree of good and evil she to could be as smart as God. God told Adam not to eat from that tree and he told Eve, only one rule to OBEY, but she pulled the fruit and ate it! so did Adam. That’s when sin entered the world and that’s why we were all born with the nature to do the wrong things. And God way back then had a plan! That plan would happen many years from that day….. day by day he waited until the right minute and it happened.

An angel appeared to a young lady named Mary. Mary was probably very frightened! The angel said as all angels do FEAR NOT! and Mary ask who are you. I am a messenger from God, the most high and Holy, he sent me to tell you… You have been chosen to have the Holy baby, the son of God and his name should be Jesus, Emmanuel the Holy one.

Mary was speechless….. Angel: ” Are you okay? nod if you understand.. ” (Mary nods her head yes)

Angel: “Will you listen and obey God’s plan for your life?”

(Mary again nods…yes) (The angel disappears)

Narrator: Mary sits speechlessly and in deep thought. That was a lot to say to a young lady who was engaged to be married to her boyfriend Joseph… What have I done? What will Joseph say? What will everyone say? Have I ever goofed? That very night as Joseph slept softly well, not softly Joseph snored very loud… Joseph woke up from his dream shaking his head, could it be? how? us? why?

Joseph hurries to Mary’s house… She meets him…

Mary:  …Joseph I need to talk to you…
(as she speaks so does he…) Joseph : Mary, we need to talk…

Joseph: ” you go first… ”

Mary:”Joseph, you are never going to believe me….”

Joseph: “go ahead I think I may….”

Mary: Joseph, I was kneeling and praying and from no where there was an angel, that said I was the chosen one, the scriptures spoke of the mother of the son of God. I told the angel I wasn’t married and the angel said that was God’s plan the scripture spoke of that too… and I said yes before I could stop myself..

Joseph: “Mary, It’s okay the angel said the same to me, Fear not and follow the plans of God and the promised Messiah was coming.”

Narrator: The king send a letter to everyone in the villages, It read you are to go to the city of your birth place and pay your taxes.By this time Mary was about to give birth to this baby, but the law was the law and it didn’t wait for any baby! On a donkey with their bags they started their journey with no hotel reservations, because they had no cell phone to call. Hoping for an empty room somewhere that started knocking on doors, each time the same… sorry, no rooms left.no rooms left.. Joseph knew before they said it…NO rooms, he would repeat. The last hotel in the city The “N” Joseph was not taking no for an answer… No rooms was the answer…… But my wife.. The door slammed anyway. The “n” keepers wife saw the young couple and the expecting mom, she slipped out the side door and stop them… excuse me, excuse me… We have a barn with animals in the back, there is no bed but you can rest on the hay… Thank you , thank you it will work for now, for we have traveled far and my wife. I see said the n keeper’s wife. When’s the little one due? anytime now….

(Barn scene opens….)

Scene opens with the cow is arguing with the donkey….

Cow: I know it was my feeding tray!

Donkey: I rode her in on my back, I know the whole story.

Chicken: I was at her feet.

Duck: (quacked) I was listening at the door of the inn!

Pig: Will you all calm down.

Cow: Why should we listen to a pig? you just roll in your mud all day, what would you know anyway?

Chicken: yeah!

Pig: Someone has to take control of this madness.

Rat: (as he picks up dropped corn… ) I know the story I was in the house and outside!

Cow: What could a rat tell us? He lives in the dump!
(All laugh)

Pig: We can sort this out if only one at a time talks. Chicken first!

Chicken: I was by the lady and I heard her said that this was the one!

Cow: One what!

Chicken: I don’t know, I just know he is the ONE!

Pig: okay, He is the one! okay, duck

Duck: I heard the lady of the house say, They only had the barn, the couple said that would be fine they had traveled a long way.

Pig: okay, we know He’s the one and they traveled a long way! rat, do you have something to add…

Rat: yeah, the man said that star was placed here so others would know!

Pig: okay we know He’s the one, they traveled a long way and others will know by the star! What will they know?

Horse ( speaks up): They also said everyone had been waiting for him.

Pig: He’s the one, they came along way, the star shows others, everyone is waiting on him. okay we are getting a story together…cow

Cow: don’t forget the baby! I gave up my food for that little one and the mother said the angel said he’s name was Jesus! What’s an angel?

Pig: Don’t know, I do know He’s the one, they traveled a long way, the star shows others, everyone is waiting on him. It’s about the baby the mother calls Jesus! wait a minute someone’s coming, sssshhhhhh, keep your ears open and mouths closed let’s see what’s going on…

Over the mountain the shepherds in the field watching their sheep and playing a star game and all of a sudden BBOOOMM! a bright blinding light!

Angel: FEAR NOT!

( screaming loudly they missed the command to FEAR NOT!)

oldest shepherd: settle down …. okay. maybe we are not seeing anything, everyone close your eyes, now open..

Smallest Shepherd: It’s real. Who are you and where did you come from? how did you find us?

Angel: slow down…. I am a messager of the most Holy God. I come in peace to tell of the great news. Tonight in Bethlehem the city of David, the Messiah was born, if you go you will find him in a manger in swaddling clothes. Go quickly follow the star….

( Shepherds leave following the star……)

(lamb enters barn with shepherds….)

lamb: excuse me, may I sit for awhile I walked from the other side of the mountain…

pig: sure, what do you know about what’s going on?

lamb: I know that my masters where playing star games and something, they called an angel came from nowhere and told them the Lamb of God was born, follow the star and you will find him in a manger…(cow) that’s my manger…. and he would be in swaddling clothes. Here we are!

pig: He’s the one, they traveled along way, the star shows others and everyone is waiting on him. It’s about the baby the mother calls Jesus! and angel said he is the lamb of God and is in a manger go see! that is a lot about nothing…

donkey: can I speak now? pig sure I forgot about you…. well it started when we were home. I was resting and an angel appeared and spoke to my lady and said she was going to have a baby and he would be the Messiah, the son of God… (There was a aawwhhh in the barn!)

pig: …why didn’t you speak up sooner donkey?

Donkey: anyway, Joseph my lady’s husband had a dream and an angel told him the same thing and then he recieved a letter about taxes and here we are, no rooms in the inns or homes and the nice lady and the last stop n said we could stay here and here we are in your barn with the most special baby to ever be born was born in your barn and slept in your manger… chicken (spoke up) and slept next to me. And don’t forget me, duck said… WOW they said together!

Narrator: In another part of the country was Magi, they where men who watched the stars, like sciencists, they where very smart men and that same night they too saw the new star…

#1 wise men: Look!

#2 wise men: where?

#3 wise men: There you can’t miss it! WOW! there it is. It is as bright and big as we thought it would be.

#1 wise men:We must go!Now?

#2: Yes! But what about dinner?

#3: What about it? should we eat first?

#1: There is no time for that! we must go!

#3: Yeah!

#2: We must go buy gifts for the king! gifts where will we get gifts at 8:30? you know the marketplace closed at 4:00 yeah you are right… digging through old boxes one finds a tie? I have a tie! It’s never been worn!

#1: And what will a baby do with a tie!

#2: Yeah, the king is a baby!

#3: Let’s just get the gifts we had ready for the past few months for this occasion. Yeah that’s right, I forgot all about that. That’s why you have us to look after you!

#1: I’ll take the gold,

#2: I guess I’ll get the frankincense

#3: That leaves me with the myrrh, good thing I like myrrh!

#1: Let’s go!

Narrator: They to left to find the king, stopped by Herod who was jealous and a wicked King. He too had heard the rumors about the new king. He told the wise men, magi that when they find him come and tell him where he is so he too could go and worship! They knew he was lying to them, remember they were wise men. Herod wanted to kill the baby so he could not take his job away.

The magi had a long trip to make so they left….Arriving later they too found the baby and presented their gifts fit for a king.

(About that time entering the barn the three camels……)

Camels: excuse us, may we rest here…
pig: why no, this seems to be the most special spot on earth tonight, why are you here?

camels: our masters are here to bring gifts to the new king…

pig: King, Messiah, God’s son. Lamb of God, wow in our barn… God must really love us to allow us to give our home up to the King of kings….. What a night!

Narrator: And that night with the chickens, duck, cows, donkey, pigs, lambs, and the rest of the animals there it was a tiny baby boy, and was he ever beautiful. Mary could not take her eyes off the beautiful baby. There in the sky was the brightest star they had ever seen over the barn they where they all were… See the King of the world was born in a barn! not a hospital not a castle, but a barn! Still it didn’t matter to Mary or Joseph, he was the most beautiful precious baby ever born!

That night all that heard came to see and worship the son of God! the Messiah the promised one! That was to beginning to God’s plan to take away our sins and make a way to heaven again.

That’s why we give gifts to each other at Christmas to remind us of the gift God gave us. His son Jesus was born and came to earth as a baby. God loves us all so much that in John 3:16 For God so loved the world…….. He gave His only begotten son. He loves us all so much he gave his son Jesus to take our punishments for all our sins., he was born, died and rose again to make a way for us, because we all know that the only thing not in heaven is SIN and we must be forgiven of sin. And that was God plan all the way from Genesis to now! What a story of love. Remember Christmas is a time to give because God gave us his son, we can give ourselves to him by receiving Jesus for our own savior by allowing him to forgive us for our sins and confessing to him when we do wrong. What better gift to give this Christmas as giving yourself to Jesus and receiving Jesus as your gift. Jesus is the reason for our season!

Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!

The Symbols of Christmas

(Children & Mom are decorating their house for Christmas)

Mom: OK Kids! Are you ready to get the house ready for Christmas?

Sandy: I love getting ready for Christmas!

Susie: It’s my favorite time of the year!

Sally: It makes me get in the mood for Christmas.

Sammy: Yeah, I guess.

Stanley: This stuff just fills up the house and gets in my way.

Mom: Girls, I’m so glad you are excited about it. But you have to remember that this “stuff”, as Stanley put it, means something as well.

Sandy: What do you mean, Mom?

Mom: Why do we celebrate Christmas?

Susie: It’s Jesus’ birthday!

Sally: It’s when we remember that Jesus came into this world as a baby.

Mom: That’s right.

Sammy: Why do we have to decorate then?

Stanley: Yeah, why do we have to fill up our house with all this stuff?

Mom: Well, let’s talk about some of this “stuff” and what it all means. Let’s start with the evergreen tree that we are decorating.

Reader 1: An evergreen tree has a very appropriate name. It is ever green – always green. It does not become dormant in the winter as other trees do. The color green represents new life and the needles of the evergreen always point up – heavenward. It symbolizes our everlasting life with Jesus Christ. We should be as the evergreen tree – always full of life, never becoming dormant in our life with Christ as our arms are lifted heavenward. “The bread of God is the One who comes down from heaven. He gives life to the world.” John 6:33

Sandy: I didn’t realize.

Susie: Wow, I didn’t either.

Sally: I just thought it was a tree.

Sammy: Yeah, I didn’t know that it meant something.

Stanley: What does this other stuff mean?

Mom: How about the ornaments?

Reader 2: Ornaments are used to decorate Christmas trees each and every year. People look for the perfect ones to fit on their tree. Our Christmas tree just would seem complete without our ornaments. Ornaments can symbolize the blessings in our lives. Our lives just wouldn’t be complete without God’s blessings. Everything that we have is due to God loving us so much that He wants to shower us with His blessings. Just as ornaments are all different shapes and sizes, blessings are all different as well. God picks and chooses each blessing for us so that it will be just right. The next time you decorate your tree, and as you put up each ornament, think of a blessing that God has given you. I think you’ll find that you’ll run out of ornaments before you can run out of blessings! “Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD your God that He has given you.” Deuteronomy 16:17

Sandy: Blessings!

Susie: We have so many blessings.

Sally: We have our home and our family.

Sammy: It’s hard to think of all of the blessings that God has given us.

Stanley: Ok, so I guess that’s not so bad. And it does look nice.

Mom: Oh, there’s so much more. How about we talk about the lights and candles.

Reader 3: Lights and candles are used to give light. When a room is full of darkness, it is dark. But, if you light a single match in a dark room, the room is light. There may be more darkness, but the light overpowers it. We are that light. We can be the single light in a world of darkness. We must share our light with the world so that the light increases. “You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.” Matthew 5:14-15

Sandy: I love the lights!

Susie: They’re so pretty!

Sally: Let’s put more lights on.

Sammy: I never knew.

Stanley: I guess I never looked at it that we are the lights for God.

Mom: Exactly. Let’s put these bells on the tree next.

Reader 4: The bell rings out to guide the lost sheep back to the fold, signifying that all are precious in the eyes of the Lord. Jesus is our shepherd and He laid down His life for us so that we may spend eternity with Him in heaven. He is calling us to follow Him through His Word. Are you going to listen? “If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leaven the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray?” Matthew 18:12 “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.” John 10:11

Sandy: The bells sound so beautiful.

Susie: I just love to listen to them.

Sally: Jesus is our shepherd.

Sammy: We are His sheep.

Stanley: He would go looking for me.

Mom: Who likes candy canes?

All Children: ME!

Mom: Let’s put these on next.

Reader 1: The Candy Cane symbolizes multiple things. If you hold it upright…it looks like a shepherd’s crook. The shepherds were some of the few people who were able to see the baby Jesus in Bethlehem. If you turn the candy cane upside down…it looks like a “J”. Jesus starts with the letter “J”. The colors of the candy cane are also symbolic. The red represents the blood that Jesus shed for us on the cross and the white represents the purity of Jesus. There are candy canes with three small red stripes running around it. These stripes symbolize the Trinity – God the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit. Who knew that this delicious simple candy was so profoundly symbolic of our Lord Jesus Christ and His simple birth? “And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS, for He will save His people from their sins.” Matthew 1:21

Sandy: These are delicious!

Susie: I love this part of Christmas.

Sally: It means so many things.

Sammy: There seems to be a reason why we do everything that we do.

Stanley: I can see now how this “stuff” has meaning.

Mom: I’m so glad that you are changing your mind about some of these things. I have some stars to put on the tree next.

Reader 2: The star is a heavenly sign of prophecy fulfilled ages ago, the shining hope for all mankind. The star led the wise men to find the baby Jesus. These wise men traveled many miles following a star in the sky. The star was their “guiding light” to the Savior. God was the wise men’s travel agent, in sorts, leading them to the greatest destination known to man – the Savior. We now have His Word as our “guiding light” to lead us to be with Him in heaven. Are you going to follow Him? “And behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was. When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.” Matthew 2:9b-10

Sandy: I like that the star was their “guiding light”.

Susie: They were able to follow the star to Jesus.

Sally: That must have been an amazing journey.

Sammy: I’m glad that we have the Bible now to help lead us.

Stanley: Yes, God’s Word leads us to Jesus.

Mom: Well, I think our tree it almost finished. We just have to put the angel on top.

Reader 3: Imagine…you are a lowly shepherd, watching over your sheep. This night seems no different than any other. Then all of a sudden an angel of the Lord is in the sky above you…telling you of the Savior’s birth. You, a shepherd? Why did God send an angel to tell shepherds? Because the message that God had about the birth of Jesus was for all people! Not just for the right, not just for the Jew…EVERYONE! God chose His #1 messenger to tell the lowest of people (in the world’s eyes) of His Son’s birth! God looks at the heart – not what the world looks at – thank goodness! “And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone ‘round about them: and they were so afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.” Luke 2:9-11

Sandy: Our tree looks beautiful!

Susie: I wouldn’t change anything.

Sally: The angel was like a messenger of God.

Sammy: The angel told the Good News of Jesus’ birth.

Stanley: Wow! I didn’t know. But what about all the other “stuff” that we put around the house.

Mom: Well, Stanley. Let’s talk about this holly that we’re going to put on the table.

Reader 4: We see holly as decorations during the Christmas season. But do we really understand what holly stands for? The leaves represent the crown of thorns that were placed upon Jesus’ head as He was being crucified. The berries symbolize the blood that He shed for us. He endured criticism, excruciating pain, and embarrassment…all for you and I. The next time you see a decoration with holly on it, remember what was done for you so that He could spend eternity with you. I know that I will. “And twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on His head and put a reed in His right hand. And kneeling before Him, they mocked Him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” Matthew 27:29

Sandy: That’s amazing what He did for us.

Susie: It makes me feel blessed to know Him.

Sally: He went through all of that for me!

Sammy: He came to this earth in order to die for me and you.

Stanley: That’s quite an amazing thing to think about during this Christmas season.

Mom: That leads us to this wreath that we’ll hang on the door.

Reader 1: The wreath has its evergreen branches bent in a circle so that the ends touch, having no beginning or end, just as there is no beginning or end of Jesus’ eternal love for us. Just as the wreath looks the same throughout and seems to not change, so He will always be the same. “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.” Hebrews 13:8

Sandy: I just love how it looks on our door.

Susie: Yes, it really finishes off the look of the room.

Sally: It’s nice to know that He will never change.

Sammy: I didn’t realize that it had a meaning.

Stanley: That’s a great reminder that even though we change and grow, He’ll always be right there. Now what about the presents? Those can’t have a meaning.

Mom: Well, you will be surprised then.

Reader 2: These days, the world has forgotten the reason for Christmas. Most people seem to think that getting presents is the greatest thing about Christmas. Other people seem to think that presents have nothing to do with Christmas. Well, they are both wrong. The wise men came to visit Jesus as a young child and gave Him presents. They have His gold, frankincense, and myrrh. They offered Him hold, as a king, paying Him tribute; frankincense, as God, for they honored God with the smoke of incense; and myrrh, as a man that should die, for myrrh was used in embalming dead bodies. These men…these wise men…saw this child and knew that He is a king, is God, and that He would die for the sins of the world. How can anyone, with the knowledge that we have now, not believe? “The Wise Men went to the house. There they saw the child with Hid mother Mary. They bowed down and worshipped Him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave Him gold, incense, and myrrh.” Matthew 2:11

Sandy: I love to get presents!

Susie: I didn’t know that was the reason we give gifts.

Sally: But, Jesus is really the greatest gift to us all.

Sammy: He truly is.
Stanley: I never knew that the wise men’s gifts had meanings. What about the wrapping? That’s just something that we came up with, right?

Mom: Yes, and no. The bows and ribbons do have a special meaning that would be good for us to remember.

Reader 3: Many people spend hours wrapping all of their presents during Christmas time. They use ribbons, garland, and bows to make sure that their presents are as beautiful as possible. What they don’t realize is that the items that they use to complete the outside of the gift have more meaning than the actually gift inside. The bow ties our present with a beautiful ribbon, just as Jesus ties us as Christians together in His love. We may not be in the same family, but we are all in the family of God. Jesus is the ribbon that binds us together. “And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.” Colossians 3:14

Sandy: I just thought the wrappings were to hide the present inside.

Susie: Yea, I never thought about them having their own meaning.

Sally: There’s really a lot to think about.

Sammy: I guess I’ll have to look at things differently.

Stanley: That’s for sure. I never knew that all of this “stuff” had meaning.

Mom: People do get a little crazy with the “stuff” of Christmas. The parties, the gift-giving, the “busy-ness” of the Christmas season. What we need to do is slow down and enjoy every moment by remembering the true meaning of Christmas. Who wants a cookie?

Stanley: I know there’s not a meaning in the cookie.

Mom: Oh, you’d be surprised.

Reader 4: Making cookies is a favorite pastime for most families during the Christmas season. Cookie cutters are used to turn ordinary dough into edible masterpieces. God doesn’t use cookie cutters when He creates each one of us. He makes every one of us so special and unique that He would have to break the mold after just one use. He is the potter and we are His clay. He wants to mold us into His masterpieces. We only need to be moldable and willing to follow His lead. “Behold, like the clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel.” Jeremiah 18:6

A Super Christmas
Characters:  Superman, Wonder Woman, Spiderman, Hulk, Batman, Cat Woman,  Mary, Joseph, 2 Shepherds

 There is a huddle of Super Heroes DSC. They create a semi circle, and are busily talking loud and frantic.

Superman; ORDER! ORDER! I call this meeting of Superheroes to order!

The group is quieted with groans.

Superman: As some of you have heard, there is a rumor going around that a new superhero is coming to earth. They say that he is coming to save the world, and that he receives his powers from the big G – O – D.

Hulk: I have heard the same thing! What does this mean!? WE save the Earth. WE have been here for years! What does this guy think he is doing?

Wonder Woman: Do we even know who this guy or WOMAN is? Doesn’t he know that that is our job?

Batman: I have heard that this G-O-D guy means real business. Apparently he has a connection with all of us. He says the he loves the world so much that he is going to give us his SON. This new superhero, is here to save the world from the villain SIN.

Spiderman: Who is this SIN? I don’t know this evil villain? Cat Woman, is he one of your arch nemeses?

Cat Woman: No. I don’t know him, but I know that I could take him down and probably better than this new guy.

Superman: OK OK, let’s calm down everyone. We don’t know if this guy is going to take our jobs. He might be here to help us, as well as the rest of the world.

Hulk: Well I don’t need any help! Didn’t you see me crush that bad guy last week? I saved a bus full of school children… with one hand!

Batman raises a hand for a high-five.

Batman: I did see that man! You were awesome, but I think that next time you could…

Cat Woman: Woah. Slow down guys. Let’s focus on this new guy. We can share our glory stories later!

Spiderman: Do we know when this new guy is supposed to show up?

Wonder Woman: I’ve heard as early as Christmas Day. That’s tomorrow!?

Hulk: NO WAY. Christmas can’t be tomorrow!? Is it really Christmas Eve?

WW: Yes, Hulk, tomorrow… I think the muscles are cutting off circulation to your brain.

Batman: This means we have to act fast! We have to find this guy, learn what his weaknesses are, and find out his enemies… AGGGH… What if he has a SIDEKICK? We have so much to do…

Superman: Well then we better start tracking this big guy down.

Superheroes Exit

Mary and Joseph walk DSR

Mary: I am so tired; can’t we just book a room somewhere? I am so tired of this walking thing.

Joseph: [irritated] Only a little bit farther love. I’m sorry that every Holiday Inn was full, but I didn’t know we would be traveling this deep into the holiday season!

Mary: Don’t get huffy at me! I didn’t ask if I wanted to flee my home, or if I wanted to become the mother of God’s son!

Joseph: Yes, dear. I know. How did that happen again? You were so frightened when you came to me.

Mary: Well an angel came from God to me in Nazareth. He told me to get excited because God chose me to bear his son. I am to call him, Jesus. I was so scared, but then the angel said do not be frightened for this means that God will always be with me. I’m still nervous and unsure about this whole thing. What if I’m not right? What if I’m not going to be a good mother to GOD’S son?

Joseph: Mary, Mary, Mary! Stop you’re worrying, and breathe. God chose you for a reason, and he chose me as your husband for a reason. (Or at least that’s what I keep telling myself.

Superheroes swarm from USL. Looking under things, behind things, under cloaks etc.

Superman: Well, we haven’t found him yet. This superhero sure knows how to hide himself. Or maybe he is in a disguise

Hulk: (Lifts a large object (ie house)) I have turned over everything, and he sure isn’t hiding under anything.

WW: HULK. PUT THAT DOWN. Do you really think the man who saves the world would be hiding under a ______?

Catwoman: I’m tired of looking. Maybe he has weakness, like Tuna, or catnip, or those little squeaky mice, or those darn little balls of light that you NEVER can catch!

Batman: Woah, down kitty. Um, we don’t know that stuff yet. Maybe these fine people have heard something about him. I’ll go ask.

Batman starts walking, then Superman puts out his arm and strides ahead.

Superman: (clears his throat) Ahem, excuse me you fine citizens but do you happen to know of a new superhero?

Mary: A new superhero? No? Joseph have you?

Joseph: (shocked) No way. Are you really SUPERMAN. (squeal) Oh my goodness, and Wonder Woman, and the Hulk, and and and and…

Mary: Oh get a hold of yourself! No, we haven’t. Do you know of place where we could stay? Apparently all the inns are full.

Spiderman: I know a man down the road who has a nice stable. You could ask if he knows of a place.

Joseph: (still in shock) Wow, you guys are all my heroes. You save the world, like EVERYDAY. And you’re here. Right now. (Squeal)

Hulk: (brushes his shoulders) Yes, we know. We are pretty powerful.

All superheroes begin striking fierce poses

WW: Oh my! Miss, are you pregnant?

Mary: Yes, I’m due almost any day. It may even be tonight.

Catwoman: Oh there is nothing better than a baby.

Superman: Oh I hope we run into you again, I would love to hold your baby.

Hulk: Me too, I love to rock babies to sleep.

Spiderman: And you’re sure you don’t crush them? (Laughs to himself)

Mary has a look of terror on her face

Mary: Yes, yes that would be nice. I’m sure I will need all the help I can get.

Joseph: You, you, you, would come see us AGAIN? Oh wow.

Faints. Supported by a superhero.

WW: (Ignoring Joseph) Do you know if it’s a boy or a girl? What are you going to name him?

Mary: It’s a boy, and his name shall be Jesus.

The superheroes give content sighs.

Joseph is revived.

Mary: Well my feet are getting sore; I think we will give that man with the stable a try. Good luck with your search for this superhero…?

Joseph: Uh, uh-huh!

Superheroes: (a hubbub of noise) Congratulations on the baby! I am so excited for you. Good luck with the baby.

Superheroes exit SL, and Mary/Joseph SR

2 Shepherds relaxing DSC

Shepherd 1: This job is sooooo LAME.

Shepherd 2: Hey, I wouldn’t complain. It’s paying for your data plan for that fancy phone. Heaven forbid that you couldn’t text on the job.

Shepherd 1: Ha… ha… ha… you think you are so funny! No seriously. This job is so boring. Nothing exciting ever happens! I mean all my friends work at Starbucks and get free coffee, and what do I get? I get to “watch o’er my flocks by night” and shovel sheep poop! Gross.

Shepherd 2: Oh come on, it isn’t that bad. It’s a clear night on Christmas Eve. You can just stare out into the black sky full of stars and really appreciate the wonder that God created

Shepherd 1: Ugh, you’re one of those, those God people.

Shepherd 2: Well yeah. I guess I am. I mean. I don’t know! I have heard that God is sending his son to save us from our sin.

VOICE: Mmmhmmm. You got that right!

Shepherds cling to each other in fear and scream.

Shepherd 1: Who is that!? I am trained in karate and I’m not afraid to use it!

Shepherd 2: Better question… where are you?!

spot light

Shepherds block the light.

VOICE: I’m right here. Do not be afraid! I am an angel from God. I bring you good news!

Shepherd 1: Sheesh lay off the glare. Miley Cyrus called and she wants her sequined body suit back!

VOICE: (Laughs) Miley Cyrus has nothing on my shine. But I have to tell you that JESUS, the son of God was born tonight! Rejoice! Immanuel, the savior of the universe was born tonight, here in Bethlehem!

Shepherd 2: Oh my goodness! Are you serious?! How exciting! Where is he? Can I go see him?

VOICE: Yes! Please do! Follow his star by night, and you will find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes.

Shepherd 1: Um. I don’t know what swaddling clothes mean, but I’m assuming when I see the baby I’ll know I’m in the right place. But what does this mean? Why is this baby such a big deal?

VOICE: God sent his son, Jesus, so that we could be forgiven of our sins. When we do bad things, or make bad choices we are sinning against God. When we sin, we are moving away from God. But God loves us so much that he is willing to send his son to us so that even when we do sin, we are forgiven. It’s called grace. Isn’t that great?

Shepherd 1: Wow. God’s love is amazing.

Shepherd 2: I know a congregation in Renton, Washington that knows a thing or two about that grace thing. They have some crazy pastor always talking about it.

VOICE: Oh don’t you worry. We know that congregation too, and that crazy Kirby guy.

Shepherd 1: I still don’t get how sending a baby is going to help though? How is he going to stop me from sinning?

Voice: Jesus is coming to help us build a relationship with God. He will be a way for us to see God, and know that he loves us. So no matter how far we try to move away from God, Jesus will be there to remind us that God will never give up on us. But seriously, get a move on over to the stable. That’s the star right over there!

Light goes out

Superheroes enter looking weary.

Superman: Excuse me fine… shepherds? Have you heard anything about a new superhero that is coming to save the earth?

Batman: We have been looking for him all day. We’re tired.

Catwoman: We’re scared he is going to take our jobs.

Shepherd 1: Woah, first an angel now super heroes?! Maybe this job isn’t so lame after all!

Shepherd 2: I don’t know anything about a new super hero, but did you hear that God’s son was born tonight!?

Hulk: Wait, did you say God’s son? That’s our guy!

WW: Woah, woah, woah Hulk. We have not been searching for a baby! How could a baby save the world?

Shepherd 1: I don’t really get it either, but let’s go see! I just want to see this Super-Baby-God … thing.

Exit

_______________________________________________________________________

Mary: Oh. Isn’t he wonderful?

Joseph: I never knew a baby was this wonderful. God has given us such a blessing.

Superheroes storm in

Superman: Alright you superhero, put your hands up! Nobody is taking my job!

Spiderman: Yeah. What he said!

WW: Oh my goodness. Boys. Settle down, can’t you tell there is a baby sleeping!

Superman: Well. Yeah. But he is going to take our jobs, and and and oh but he is so cute!

Mary: Yes, he is. I didn’t expect to see you guys again so soon. But what is this about my son taking your jobs?

Catwoman: Well, we heard that Jesus is this new superhero coming to town. And they that he is going to save the whole world from SIN.

Hulk: So we thought that no one would need us anymore. But this is a baby! So we don’t have anything to worry about guys! (coos at the baby)

Batman: You’re right! Phew. I was getting worried. So, were they wrong? Is Jesus just a baby?

Mary: Well, right now he is. But God has great plans in store for him. He will grow up and save us from our own sin.

Shepherd 1: We heard all about that! An angel came to us and told us to not be afraid because Jesus was born. And that he will bring us grace!

Shepherd 2: You know, you’re starting to sound like one of those “church” people…

Shepherd 1: Woah! I am. Well, could I maybe come to church with you sometime?

Shepherd 2: Yeah, I think I know just the place to take you!

Superman: Hold on, hold on! So Jesus isn’t going to take over my job? I still get to go out and save people?

Joseph: (holding the baby) Of course, you can still go save people. But, God sent his son so that we can be saved from ourselves and the sins we do. Jesus is reminding us of God’s love, and how we can share it with others. So now, when you save people you can tell them about Jesus’ power and about God’s unending love for us.

Spiderman: Wow! Ok! I think I could do that! “Stop right there mister! I will save you innocent citizens! But Jesus will save you with God’s love!” I like it!

Mary: I am so glad you all came to see Jesus and that now you will spread God’s love. I am not afraid anymore, I am trusting God and his plan. This is a merry Christmas.

ALL: Merry Christmas, and God’s Peace!

Stories of the Savior
Script Part 1: Christmas
(2 Scientists in lab coats & clipboards enter the stage)
(S1=Scientist 1 & S2=Scientist 2)
S1: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We are so very pleased that you have chosen to
join us for this presentation of “Stories of the Savior”.
S2: My colleague and I have been discussing the birth of Jesus and we have decided that
it doesn’t really start in the New Testament.
S1: (nodding in approval) Quite right. You see, it actually started at the beginning.
S2: So that is where our presentation is going to begin….(pause) at the beginning.
S1: Yes, at creation, to be exact.
S2: You may be wondering, what does the birth of Jesus have to do with Creation?
Reader: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was
God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being by Him, and apart from
Him nothing came into being that has come into being. In Him was life,
S2: Yes, of course. Adam and Eve.
Reader: Then the Lord God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living being. Genesis 2:7
Reader: And the Lord God fashioned into a woman the rib which He had taken from the
man, and brought her to the man. Genesis 2:22
S1: You may ask why do we bring them up in a Christmas presentation?
S2: Yes, why ARE you bringing them up?
S1: Well, it all started with them. They are the first story of the Savior.
Reader: When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight
to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and
ate; and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate. Genesis 3:6
Reader: And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of
the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God
among the trees of the garden. Then the Lord God called to the man, and said to him,
“Where are you?” He said, "I heard the sound of You in the garden, and I was afraid; so I
hid myself." And He said, "Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to
eat?” The man said, "The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me from the tree,
and I ate." Then the Lord God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?" And the
woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate.” Genesis 3: 8-13
S2: Sounds like the “blame game” to me.
S1: Yes, but by their disobedience, the human race now needed a Savior. That’s why we
wanted to do this presentation today.
S2: Our presentation is called “Stories of the Savior” because we are telling about different
people in the Bible and their story of the Savior.
(chart appears on screen showing Creation, Adam & Eve, and Noah)
S1: Exactly! I have this chart that can help us along the way.
S2: Fancy!
S1: I know. (acting proud)
S2: So who’s next?
2
(exit Adam & Eve) (enter Noah)
S1: Noah
Reader: Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that
every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And the Lord was sorry
that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. And the Lord said,
“I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, from man to animals
to creeping things and to birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I have made them. But
Noah found favor in the eyes of the Lord. Genesis 6:5-8
Song - Arky Arky Song
S2: How does Noah have a story of the Savior?
Reader: For the coming of the Son of Man will be just like the days of Noah. For as in
those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, they were
marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and they did not
understand until the flood came and took them all away; so shall the coming of the Son of
Man be. Matthew 24:37-39
Reader: For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust, in order that He
might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit; in
which also he went and made proclamation to the spirits now in prison, who once were
disobedient, when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the
construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through
the water. And corresponding to that, baptism now saves you - not the removal of dirt
from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience - through the resurrection of
Jesus Christ. 1 Peter 3:18-21
S2: So Adam and Eve have a story, and so does Noah. Who else?
(exit Noah) (enter Abraham)
S1: We are going to move on to Abraham.
S2: I love his song! (starts singing “Father Abraham” for 1st verse…)
3
S1: (cuts off song) No! No! We’re not going to sing THAT song.
Song - Trust and Obey
S2: So what was Abraham’s story of the Savior?
Reader: And in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have
obeyed My voice. Genesis 22:18
Reader: And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s offspring, heirs according to
promise. Galatians 3:29
Reader: The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
Matthew 1:1
S1: Jesus came from the blood line of Abraham.
S2: So Abraham was Jesus’ great, great, great, great, great, (counts on fingers, then pauses)
really great grandpa.
S1: I guess you could say it like that.
(exit Abraham) (enter David)
S2: But they also said that Jesus came from David. Should we go on to him next?
Song - Only a Boy Named David
Reader: He raised up David to be their king, concerning whom He also testified and said, “ I
have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My heart, who will do all My will.” From the
offspring of this man, according to promise, God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus. Acts
13:22-23
S2: Jesus came from the line of David.
S1: And that leads us up to the actual birth of Jesus.
4
S2: We skipped a lot of people in the Bible who have stories that lead up to the birth of
Jesus.
S1: Yes, but if we showed every one of them, we would maybe still be presenting them
until Jesus came the second time. So we decided just to show a few.
S2: That makes sense. I would probably get hungry.
S1: We are going to move on to the people who had a personal story of the Savior.
S2: There are many people who have stories that directly relate to the birth of Jesus.
(exit David) (enter Mary & Gabriel)
S1: Let’s start with Mary’s story. She is the best place to start when we’re discussing the
actual birth of Jesus.
S2: Her story was a deeply personal one.
Reader: Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee,
called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the descendants
of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary. And coming in, he said to her, “Hail, favored one!
The Lord is with you.” But she was greatly troubled at this statement, and kept pondering
what kind of salutation this might be. Luke 1:26-29
Reader: And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary; for you have found favor with
God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb, and bear a son, and you shall name Him
Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will
give Him the throne of His father David; and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever;
and His kingdom will have no end.” Luke 1:30-33
(Gabriel & Mary sits on the side of stage) (enter Zacharias)
S1: Mary's story starts with her being told that she had been chosen to be the mother of
the Savior.
S2: That truly is an amazing story.
5
S1: This is where John’s story is started as well.
S2: John’s story started before He was even born.
Reader: But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zacharias, for your petition has been
heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will give him the name John.
And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth. For he will be great
in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine or liquor, and he will be filled with the
Holy Spirit, while yet in his mother's womb. And he will turn back many of the sons of
Israel to the Lord their God. Luke 1:13-16
Reader: And it is he who will go as a forerunner before Him in the spirit and the power of
Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers back to the children, and the disobedient to the
attitude of the righteous; so as to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. Luke 1:17
(exit Zacharias) (enter Elizabeth)
Reader: Now at this time Mary arose and went with haste to the hill country, to a city of
Judah, and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. And it came about that
when Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was
filled with the Holy Spirit. And she cried out with a loud voice, and said, “Blessed among
women are you, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And how has it happened to me,
that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold, when the sound of your
greeting reached my ears, the baby leaped in my womb for joy. Luke 1:39-44
S1: John’s story of the Savior continues, but that will have to be for another presentation.
S2: Right you are. We are just talking about the stories of the Savior as they have to do
with His birth today.
(exit Elizabeth) (enter Joseph)
S1: Joseph’s story fits in here.
S2: Joseph was questioning whether he should take Mary as his wife, when an angel came
to him in a dream and told him that it would be ok. The angel told him,
6
Reader: “And she will bear a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will
save His people from their sins.” Matthew 1:21
Reader: And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him,
and took her as his wife. Matthew 1:24
S1: Joseph’s story is that God chose him to raise His one and only Son. To be His father
here on earth.
S2: That is an incredible story! Can you imagine raising the Son of God as your very own
child? The pressure!
S1: And the pleasure! Just like it is raising any wonderfully gifted child (feeling proud of
himself)…Ahem! We are now going to move on to the innkeeper.
(exit angel) (Joseph to the side with Mary) (enter innkeeper)
Reader: Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus, that a census be
taken of all the inhabited earth. This was the first census taken while Quirinius was
governor of Syria. And everyone was on his way to register for the census, each to his own
city. Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of
David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David, in order
to register along with Mary, who was engaged to him, and was with child. While they were
there, the days were completed for her to give birth. And she gave birth to her firstborn
son; and she wrapped Him in cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room
for them in the inn. Luke 2:1-7
S2: That didn’t mention an innkeeper.
S1: It does say that Mary gave birth to Jesus and laid Him in a manger. Do you know what
a manger is?
S2: Sure. It’s like a trough that animals eat out of.
S1: Where do we usually find troughs that animals eat out of?
S2: In barns.
7
S1: What’s another name for a barn?
S2: A stable.
S1: Someone has to own the stables, don’t they?
S2: Yeah.
S1: That is who I am calling the “innkeeper”. He was the owner of the place where Mary
and Joseph stayed and where Jesus was born.
S2: Right! He has a story of the Savior. He didn’t know that by telling Mary and Joseph
that they could stay in his stable, that he was giving housing to the son of God! Wow!
What a thought!
S1: Yes. He was able to provide a place to stay for His Savior, and he didn’t even know it!
Song - Silent Night
(enter shepherds and angel(s) stand off to the side)
S2: This is where the shepherds’ story fits in also.
Reader: In the same region there were some shepherds staying out in the fields and
keeping watch over their flock by night. And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before
them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened.
But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great
joy which will be for all the people; for today in the city of David there has been born for
you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. This will be a sign for you: you will find a baby
wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger." Luke 2:8-12
Reader: And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host
praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace among men with
whom He is pleased.” Luke 2:13-14
(exit all angels)
8
Reader: When the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds began
saying to one another, "Let us go straight to Bethlehem then, and see this thing that has
happened which the Lord has made known to us." So they came in a hurry and found their
way to Mary and Joseph, and the baby as He lay in the manger. When they had seen this,
they made known the statement which had been told them about this Child. And all who
heard it wondered at the things which were told them by the shepherds. But Mary
treasured all these things, pondering them in her heart. The shepherds went back,
glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as had been told
them. Luke 2:15-20
Song - Joy to the World
(exit shepherds) (enter Simeon)
S1: There was a man named Simeon who also had a story of the Savior.
S2: He was told by the Holy Spirit that he would not die until he saw the Savior.
Reader: And he came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the
child Jesus, to carry out for Him the custom of the Law, then he took Him into his arms,
and blessed God, and said, "Now Lord, You are releasing Your bond-servant to depart in
peace, according to Your word; for my eyes have seen Your salvation, which You have
prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light of revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory
of Your people Israel.” Luke 2:27-32
S1: He was actually able to hold the Savior in his arms!
(enter Anna)
S2: But, let’s not forget about Anna. Her story was right there with Simeon’s.
Reader: And there was a prophetess, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher.
She was advanced in years and had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,
and then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple, serving night
and day with fastings and prayers. At that very moment she came up and began giving
thanks to God, and continued to speak of Him to all those who were looking for the
redemption of Jerusalem. Luke 2:36-38
9
S1: So that concludes today’s presentation.
S2: Of course you all know that this evening’s presentation is only the beginning of the
story. This is only the beginning of the Stories of the Savior.
S1: There are so many people who have a story of the Savior.
S2: What's your story?
(all bow)

Act I

Scene I

(Living room with Mom alone.)

Mom:  I don’t know how I’m going to do it this year.  Christmas is just so expensive.  I don’t want the kids to be disappointed.   (Pacing around room slowly)

Mom: I just wonder why we even bother anymore.  (Starts putting some ornaments on the tree)

(Mom stops looking at the ornament with a picture of the family.  Carries it and goes to the couch and sits)

Mom:  All four of us… I miss him so much and it is so hard without him.  Please help us this Christmas.  (Mom drops head.)

(Sound of door opening offstage and the kids coming)

(Mom wipes a tear and quickly puts the ornament on the tree.)

Mom:  The kids…..  pull it together.

(Son and Daughter enter taking coats off and throwing the coats on corner of couch.)

Daughter: We’re home.  Did you know that Becky is getting a cell phone for Christmas?  Why can’t I get a cell phone?

Son:  Yeah, so you could talk all the time, like anyone wants to hear you more than they already do!

Mom:  Be nice.  Remember Christmas is just around the corner.  And I’m sorry, but I just don’t think you are quite ready for a cell phone.   Now, will you two please help me finish decorating the tree?

Son: Yes Mom (sarcastically)

Daughter: Fine! (sarcastically)

(All start decorating.  Mom steps aside.)

Mom:  Lord, what am I going to do?  I don’t know how I can afford the kind of gifts that their friends are getting this year.  Give me Your wisdom.

(Mom goes and gets the box of the manger scene and takes it to the table to set up.)

Mom:  My favorite decoration…..

Son:  What?  The statues and barn?  (Turning to look at Mom)

Daughter:  It’s called the manger scene.  The whole celebrating the homeless baby is kinda dull though.

Mom:  Let me tell you a story.  We’ll finish the tree later, come sit and listen.  Do this for me, please.

(Kids take a seat on the couch semi-paying attention; Mom places a red cloth across the table and picks up the figures of Mary and Joseph)

Mom:  There once was a young lady named Mary who was very excited to be getting married to a nice man named Joseph.  Mary was visited by an angel who told her she would have the son of God, Jesus.  Mary was very concerned as to what Joseph would say, but God had that taken care of. (Lights fade)

Scene 2:

(Mary kneels in prayer)

Mary:  God, you have told me that I will carry Your child.  I don’t understand this, but I am willing to do Your will.  But God, I don’t know what to do.  Joseph is going to be so upset.   (Mary drops her head)

(Joseph sits on side of his bed)

Joseph:  God, I thought Mary was a follower of You.  I thought she was special, but she is pregnant now.  Where was I mistaken?  (Joseph lies down to sleep.)

(Angel appears, Joseph remains asleep)

Angel:  Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.

(Joseph sits up as the angel disappears.  Looks around and then lays back down) (Lights fade)

Scene 3:

Daughter:  So, God sent an angel to Joseph to let him know that Mary was telling the truth?

Mom:  Exactly.  Joseph had gotten so upset that he was not going to take Mary as his wife until the angel spoke to him.  When he woke up, he knew that Mary was telling the truth about her pregnancy and the angel and he knew that Mary was to be his wife.

Son:  So did they not have a hospital to have the baby at? No coybely pocket doppler to monitor the baby? Or even a house?

Mom: (Finishes setting up nativity set) Joseph had a home and worked as a carpenter.  But, they had to travel to be counted in a registry in the town of Bethlehem at a certain time.  And that time happened to be right at the time that Mary was about to have the baby, the child of God.  Because many people had to travel to Bethlehem at that time, when they arrived, there was no place for them to stay.  One innkeeper finally let them take shelter in the barn.  That’s why the manger scene is so special.  That’s where the son of God was born.

Scene 4

Away in a Manger    (spotlight on manger scene)

Act II

Scene 1

Daughter:  Mom, the story of Jesus’ birth is a sweet story, but why do we still celebrate it all these years later?  That happened, like, a long time ago.  Now Christmas is just about the gifts and stocking stuffers, at least that’s what the TV commercials say.

Mom:  Kids, Christmas is special because the birth of Jesus shows us how much God loves us.  Without Jesus, we could never do enough or be good enough to go to heaven when we die.  Before Jesus was born, the Jewish people tried to earn God’s forgiveness by following a strict set of rules and by sacrificing sheep and other animals.  However, these were just symbols of what God would do later byh sending Jesus to earth.  God’s people knew that someday a Messiah was coming because it was predicted in the Scriptures, thousands of years before His birth.

(lights fade)

Scene 2: (Spotlight on Isaiah at table writing on a scroll.  Prophecy of Jesus’s birth and that he would be the Savior will be read from offstage.)

Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel.   (PAUSE)

For to us a child is born,
to us a son is given,
and the government will be on his shoulders.
And he will be called
Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. (PAUSE)

He was despised and rejected by men,
a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering.
Like one from whom men hide their faces
he was despised, and we esteemed him not.

Surely he took up our infirmities
and carried our sorrows,
yet we considered him stricken by God,
smitten by him, and afflicted.

But he was pierced for our transgressions,
he was crushed for our iniquities;
the punishment that brought us peace was upon him,
and by his wounds we are healed.

Scene 3:

Son:  That is pretty cool!  The birth happened just like the prophet described it!

Daughter:  DUH! If God predicted it then of course it would come true.

Mom:  Now, let me finish telling you about the birth so you will remember why it is so important to not let the true message of Christmas get lost in all the other hoopla on TV and in the stores.  God loves us and wants us to love Him because He has so many blessings He wants to share with us.  Because of our sin, there is no way we can go to heaven or even have a life of peace on our own.  God is holy and sin cannot be in His presence.  That’s where the problem is for us.  We are sinful.  So, God made a way for us.  He sent His son to earth in the form of a human to take the punishment for our sins.  Jesus lived like a man so we can relate to Him and learn from His example.  As an adult, He took the punishment for our sins by dying on the cross.  When He did this, He fulfilled the promise God had made thousands of years earlier.

(Lights come up on Jesus on cross with his disciples, Mary, and assorted others around mourning.)

Mom:  See, that is why Christmas is special.  When God came to earth as a baby, hope became a reality for us.  Christmas is about God’s love, hope, and the peace that comes from knowing Jesus.

(Lights fade on family, lingering on the cross scene and then all lights off.)

(Lights come back up and cast gathers for a bow.)

Long ago, before even our grandparents’ grandparents’ grandparents were alive, the land of Israel was ruled by a wicked king named Antiochus Epiphanes.

King Antiochus counted many Jews among his subjects, and, just like so many of us today, our Jewish ancestors lived their lives according to Jewish custom and tradition. Like us, they celebrated Shabbat and marked the festivals of Passover, Sukkot, and Shavuot. Unlike us, though, our Jewish ancestors worshiped at the ancient Temple in the city of Jerusalem. This Temple was the holiest of holy places, the center of Jewish life.

But King Antiochus did not want to rule over a nation of many religions and many cultures; he wanted to rule one nation with one religion and one culture. He wanted all the people of his land to live the way he lived and to pray the way he prayed, according to Greek customs – and this meant that he did not want the Jewish people to dress differently or worship differently or eat differently.

Under King Antiochus, the practice of Judaism was completely abolished. He forbid the Jews from celebrating Shabbat, and he forbid the Jews from observing the festivals. He also forbid the Jews from reading or studying Torah. But perhaps worst of all, King Antiochus forbid Jewish worship in the Temple, and he turned the holy Temple into a place that became very unholy, making a real mess by setting up idols and altars to Greek gods inside.

Many Jews were afraid for their lives, so they felt forced to follow the king’s orders. But one group of brave souls decided that they would not submit to the king; they would not worship foreign gods or give up their Jewish way of life. This group was called the Maccabees, and they were determined to take back their Temple and defend their religious freedom.

The Maccabees were led at first by a man named Mattathias, and then, later, by his son Judah. Compared with the King’s army, they were small in number, but they were mighty in spirit. With faith and relentless determination as their guides, the Maccabees won a stunning victory over the King’s army. They fought hard and, against all odds, they won.

The Maccabees successfully took back the Temple from King Antiochus, but they were heartbroken to discover that the King had not taken care of their holy space. They got to work cleaning and purifying it, and they removed all the foreign idols and altars the king had set up inside. They lovingly cleansed every inch of the Temple, and then, on the 25th day of the month of Kislev, the Maccabees held a glorious rededication ceremony. The word “Hanukkah” means “dedication,” and it comes from the moment when the Temple was triumphantly returned to the Jewish people.

The most famous story about that rededication comes from our Talmud, where we read that, when the Maccabees walked into the Temple, they found only enough oil to light the menorah (lamp) for one day – but miraculously, that small amount of oil lasted for eight days, which is exactly how long it took to get new oil.

Today, our celebration of Hanukkah lasts eight days, in honor of the miracles that occurred so many years ago. We light eight candles on the hanukkiah (one candle the first night, two the second night, and so on) and we eat latkes (potato pancakes) and other foods fried in oil. We spin the dreidel, whose letters remind us “Nes Gadol Haya Sham,” “A great miracle happened there.” We give and receive chocolate gelt (coins) and often exchange gifts, too.

With every Hanukkah candle we light, we illumine the most important messages of all: that we must always work to find light in the darkness, and we must always work to keep the light of religious freedom burning for all people, for all time.

The Story of Hanukkah
A long, long time ago in the land of Israel, the most special place for the Jewish people was the Temple (synagogue) in Jerusalem. The Temple contained many beautiful objects, including a tall, golden menorah. Unlike menorahs of today, this one had seven (rather than nine) branches. Instead of being lit by candles or light bulbs, this menorah burned oil. Every evening, oil would be poured into the cups that sat on top of the menorah. The Temple would be filled with shimmering light.

At the time of the Hanukkah story, a mean king named Antiochus ruled over the land of Israel. “I don’t like these Jewish people,” declared Antiochus. “They are so different from me. I don’t celebrate Shabbat or read from the Torah, so why should they?”  Antiochus made many new, cruel rules. “No more celebrating Shabbat! No more going to the Temple, and no more Torah!” shouted Antiochus. He told his guards to go into the Temple and make a mess. They brought mud, stones, and garbage into the Temple. They broke furniture and knocked things down; they smashed the jars of oil that were used to light the menorah.



Antiochus and his soldiers made the Jews feel sad and angry. A Jewish man named Judah Maccabee said, “We must stop Antiochus! We must think of ways to make him leave the land of Israel.” At first, Judah’s followers, called the Maccabees, were afraid.  “Judah,” they said, “Antiochus has so many soldiers. His soldiers carry such big weapons and he uses huge elephants to fight his battles! How can we Jews, who don’t have weapons, fight against him?” Judah said, “If we think very hard and plan very carefully, we will be able to defeat him.” It took a long time, but at last the Maccabees chased Antiochus and his men out of Israel.



As soon as Antiochus and his soldiers were gone, the Jewish people ran to Jerusalem to clean their Temple. What a mess! The beautiful menorah was gone, and the floor was covered with trash, broken furniture, and pieces from the shattered jars of oil. The Maccabees built a new menorah. At first they worried that they would not be able to light their new menorah, but they searched and searched, until at last they found one tiny jar of oil – enough to light the menorah for just one evening. The Maccabees knew that it would be at least eight days before they could get more oil, but they lit the menorah anyway. To their surprise, this little jar of oil burned for eight days. The Jewish people could not believe their good fortune. First, their small army had chased away Antiochus’ large army, and now the tiny jar of oil had lasted for eight whole days! 



The Jewish people prayed and thanked God for these miracles. Every year during Hanukkah, Jews light menorahs for eight days to remember the miracles that happened long ago. 

In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. 2 (This was the first census that took place while[a] Quirinius was governor of Syria.) 3 And everyone went to their own town to register.

4 So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. 5 He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. 6 While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, 7 and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.

8 And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. 9 An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. 10 But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. 11 Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. 12 This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.”

13 Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,

14 “Glory to God in the highest heaven,
    and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.”

15 When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.”

16 So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. 17 When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, 18 and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. 19 But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. 20 The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.

Joseph Accepts Jesus as His Son
18 This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about : His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. 19 Because Joseph her husband was faithful to the law, and yet did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly. 20 But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. 21 She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.” 22 All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: 23 “The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel” (which means “God with us”). 24 When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. 25 But he did not consummate their marriage until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.

MEANEST MOTHER IN THE WORLD
This can be done as a monologue or with four characters.
At rise: Character is seated, swinging legs like a 4 year old.
(pouting) I have the meanest mother in the world. Other kids had candy and Twinkies for lunch,
but I had to eat soup and sandwiches with (make face) whole wheat bread. Supper was gross
too. Vegetables, fruit and sometimes even PRUNES. At least I wasn't the only one with the
meanest mother in the whole world. My brother and sisters had her too.

(age 8, pacing) I Have the meanest mother in the whole wide world. If we disobeyed she'd
actually strike us. Not just once in a while either but every time we were disobedient. Can you
imagine hitting a child just because they'd broken some stupid rule like (change voice to
mother's) "Don't threw the cat off the roof" or "Don't give the Dcon to your baby brother".
You begin to see how really mean she was. Sometimes my mother thought she was a judge
saying (mother voice) "always tell the truth, the whole, truth and nothing but the truth." even if it
killed us and sometimes it nearly did (rub bottom)
The worst is yet to come. We had to be in bed at nine and up at seven. We never got to watch
the late, late, late show or sleep in until noon like all the other kids did. And she never paid
attention to the child labor laws either. (mother's voice) "Wash the dishes, make the beds, cut
the grass, take out the trash” We had to do all these cruel and inhumane things too. She and dad
must have laid awake nights just dreaming up horrible things for us to do.
(change to 12/13 years old voice, standing, arms crossed) I have the meanest mother in the
whole world. I have limits on using the cell phone! Notice I didn’t say MY phone. No, we
kids only get the kid’s phone when it’s (switching to mother voice) necessary. Plus, we have a
schedule for who gets the computer.
I don’t see why I can’t be on it when no one else is using
it. Plus she acts like some kind of drill sergeant (switch to mother voice) “You’re not going out
dressed like that and not until I’ve looked at your homework”.
She is the nosiest mother too. Always wanting to know where we were going and who we
were going with and when we'd be back. And you won't believe this. We have to be back
when we said we'd be or we get grounded! It’s like having a ball and chain around your leg.
(With fervor) She is mean.
(change to adult) When I was a child I KNEW I had the meanest mother in the whole world.
Now I'm the meanest mother in the whole world. The other night my 7 year old asked me if she
could spend the night at a friend’s house. I said "No" because it was a school night. She called
me the meanest mother in the world. I thought about my mother as she stomped off to her
room. Then I thanked God I had the meanest mother in the world.

Dog Hats
CHARACTERS: A and B as dogs. A and B should ham it up, pretending to be dogs – panting with
tongues out, scratching at fleas, etc.
COSTUMES: Street clothes with dog collars, possibly fake ears.
PROPS: none
SETTING: None specified

At rise: A and B walk in on all fours from opposite sides. They stop to talk.
A: Arf, Arf! How’s it going?
B: Not so good, I’m afraid. I’ve had a fight with Lassie.
A: The collie over on Main Street?
B: That’s the one. We had plans to dig around and look for old bones together. But then we had a BIG
argument. Lassie was wearing one of those stupid hats people like to put on us dogs, to make us look
cute. I happened to say how stupid Lassie looked.
A: I bet Lassie got upset.
B: Sure did. Started barking up a storm. Lassie got all worked up into a lather and raced off home in big
"woof". We didn’t even start digging at all. It was a wasted afternoon all round.
A: You really stuck your paw in your mouth, if you know what I mean.
B: Yeah, and now Lassie won’t even bark at me. I’ve been bored with nobody to chase cats with or dig
for bones.
A: I think you ought to apologize to Lassie for what you said. Maybe you could work things out between
you.
B. Yeah I guess so. It was a pretty stupid thing to disagree over.
A: People do it all the time too. They argue over all sorts of silly things at times. It's so easy to get
sidetracked from what's really important. (To audience) What are some stupid things to fight over? (Get
suggestions)
B: (To audience) Anybody have any ideas about what I can say to Lassie to apologize? (Get suggestions.
With A get children to give some real life examples of stupid things to fight about and how they made
peace.)

I find that sometimes as a Christian I have to carefully watch what I say or else I...

D. Exactly.
B. Well I'm off to talk to Rolly to sort things out.

Peacemaker of the Gossipers

CHARACTERS: A and B
COSTUMES: Street clothes
PROPS: Bible
SETTING: None specified

At rise: A is deep in thought. B enters.
B: Are you studying for a test or something?
A: No, I’m studying a scripture. “Blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called the sons of God. It
is in Matthew 5, verse 9. I want to do something to patch up the problems with all the gossip and fighting
going on.
B: That’s a great idea. Maybe I can help.
A: Did you know Carol and Keisha had a big argument?
B: Yes. They keep asking me what the other one is saying about them. I don’t want to get in the middle
of it.
A: You ought to see them now.
B: What happened?
A: Every time I talked to one of them they said some pretty nasty things about the other one. So I looked
at what they said and found the good in it.
B: How did that help?
A: I would go to Carol and tell her the nice part about what Keisha said. For instance, Keisha said
(Changing to a mocking voice) "I hate school but I suppose Carol likes it since she's the smartest girl in
class. She is always on the honor roll. It's disgusting.”
B: How did you handle that?
A: I told Carol that Keisha thought she was the smartest girl in class.
B: Wow. It was the truth. How did it go over?

A: They became friends again. In fact Keisha spent the night at Carol’s last night. Now if I could only
figure out a way to bring peace everywhere.
B: You've been a real peacemaker. That's a good description of a child of God.
A: (to audience) How about you boys and girls? Will you be a peacemaker? Listen for good things
about others and pass that along.
B: You will see what a difference it will make. It will please your friends, and it will also please God.
A: It will please you, too, for the Bible calls peacemakers "blessed" or "happy". Find at least one
compliment today to carry to someone else.
B: Especially between people who are not getting along.

Building bridges
CHARACTERS: 3
COSTUMES: A and B in street clothes. Narrator/carpenter in overalls
PROPS: Hat, tool box, nails, two pieces of wood for a cross
SETTING: Implied outdoors
Narrator/carpenter: (To audience) Once upon a time two siblings who lived on adjoining property fell into
conflict. It was the first serious fight in 40 years of living side by side, sharing things, helping each other
and enjoying being friends as well as siblings.
A: (To audience) I don’t even remember what started it. It was a small thing someone said.
B: (To audience) But it grew, no, it exploded into bitter words. (To A, gruffly) I have absolutely had
enough of you. It seems all you want to do is say and do hurtful things to me. Stay out of my life and off
my property from now on.
A: (Angry) Fine, I’ll stay out of your life. And to make it easier, I’ll just take my bulldozer and make a
creek between our properties. That way you needn’t worry about me getting in your way. Nor will I have
to worry about you getting onto my property or into my business anymore. (A takes a blue streamer and
lays it down to divide their property)
Narrator/carpenter: For months, things went on. At times, the brothers stood on either side of the creek,
hurling insults and screaming at each other. Then, one morning, there was a knock at B:’s door. He
opened it to find a carpenter in need of work. (Picks up his tool box, puts on hat, pantomimes knocking on
the door)
B: Yes?
Carpenter: (handing him his business card) I’m looking for a few days work. Perhaps you have a few
small jobs here and there that I could help you with?
B: Yes, I do have a job for you. See that farm across the creek? That's my awful, horrible, terrible
neighbor. A few months ago there was a meadow between us, but he took his bulldozer and now there’s a
creek between us. I think he did that to spite me, but I'll go him one better. Take that lumber and build me
a fence - an 8-foot high fence, so I won't have to look at him ever again.
Carpenter: I think I understand the situation. I have wood and nails. I can fix the situation. (B exits.
Carpenter takes 2 pieces of wood and makes a cross. He lays it over the “creek”)
B: (Angry at the carpenter.) This is not a fence; this is a bridge. Why did you do that?

Carpenter: Because sometimes what you want is not what you need. (A comes in, stares at the bridge,
breaks into a big grin and walks across the “bridge” with open arms, hugging B when reaching the other
side.)
A: Thank you so much. After all I have said and done, you built a bridge. Can you forgive me for
everything? (Carpenter quietly exits without them noticing)
B: Ummm. Yeah. I forgive you. Will you forgive me too?
A: Absolutely. (They embrace) It was actually that carpenter who built the bridge for us. I don’t even
know his name. You are quite a brother to build this bridge after all I've said and
done.
B: (Starts across the bridge. They meet in the middle and hug.) I’ve missed you. I am so happy we can
be friends as well as siblings again. Actually that carpenter. (Looks around) Where did he go?
A: Who was he?
B: (reading the business card) The carpenter from Galilee. “I fixed it all with wood and nails.” (To
audience) Who do you think that carpenter was? What do you think he means about fixing things with
wood and nails? (A and B should continue questioning the audience to bring out that the carpenter was
Jesus, he fixed things by dying on the cross for us and that by letting him give us what we need, not
always what we want, we have a better life in him.)

The Duct Taped Mouth
CHARACTERS: A and B
COSTUMES: Street clothes
PROPS: Duct Tape
SETTING: None specified
At rise: A and B are walking toward each other from opposite directions.
A: Why do you have duct tape on your mouth?
B: (Hamming it up, mumbles through the tape and uses exaggerated motions to try to communicate. A is
confused and keeps making wrong guesses until B finally removes the tape and talks normally)
A: Your computer ate all the pizza? ….. You just got a new goat? ….. The car jumped over the moon?
B: (removing tape) I can only take this off for a second. Tell me if you see my little sister coming.
A: OK. But why?
B: See, every time I try to talk to my younger sister, mean words fly out of my mouth.
A: You mean you speak unkindly to her?
B: You could put it that way, but I prefer to think of it as words flying out of my mouth.
That way I'm not responsible--I can't control it!
A: Words are hard to control. James says, "But no one can tame the tongue; it is a restless evil and full of
deadly poison."
B: Deadly poison? I didn't realize it was that bad. If the verse said that, "No one can tame the tongue;" It's
hopeless! I'm ruined!
A: Not completely ruined. You've forgotten that in Philippians Paul says, "I can do all things through
Christ who strengthens me." It's true, without God's help we’re hopeless. But with Jesus on our side, we
even control our tongues!
B: So I could put the duct tape on my just my tongue instead of over my mouth?

A: I don’t think that is the best solution. I mean – how would you eat? This is what I did when I kept
saying horrible things to my brother. I asked God to guard my mouth. Psalms 141:3 says, "Set a guard,
Oh Lord, over my mouth; keep watch over the door of my lips."
B: God is stronger than duct tape.
A: He sure is. Proverbs also says that "He who guards his mouth and his tongue, guards his soul from
troubles." But don't forget that we can't guard our mouths on our own…we must ask God to let the words
of our mouths be acceptable in His sight.
B: Okay, I can do that. What's the second thing?
A: I think we should practice. I'll pretend to be your little sister. I am in your room, and when you come
in, you have to say something. If you say godly things, something Jesus might like, the audience will
cheer for you and give you a thumbs up...
B: And if I say mean things?
A: Then the audience will say, "Boo" And give you the thumbs down.
B: Okay, let's try it.
A: All right! (To audience) You ready? Cheer and thumbs up for nice things, but boo and thumbs down
for bad things. (to B) start with the last thing you said to your sister.
B: You little hoodlum! This is my room, you hear? You better get out before I count to five, or else…
(Audience boos.)
A: Let's try that again. No name-calling this time.
B: No name-calling? I'll try. What are you doing in my room? It's mine! Get out right now!
(Audience boos.)
A: Hmmm…instead of ordering her around, try to make your words kind.
B: Kind? Hmm, that's new! I'll try it. (Gruffly) Please get out of my room.
(Audience boos.)
A: Try this. Talk to her the way you liked to be talk to.
B: Oh, you mean the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you'd have others do unto you.

A: That's right! But that's not just some little rule…Jesus said it!
B: That’s right. He did. You remember that verse in James that I told you about?
B: Uh huh.
A: Well, the next verse says that with our tongue we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men,
who have been made in the likeness of God;"
B: What is that supposed to mean?
A: Everybody was created in the likeness of God. When we speak to them cruelly, it’s like we're talking
to God that way. Jesus says that whatever we do to the least of them, we're doing it to Him!
B: That's pretty serious.
A: I think so!
B: Okay, I think I'm ready now.
A: All right, let's go!
B: (Kindly) Becky, I have to finish my homework before I can play with you. Could you please give me
some space and wait for me outside my room so I can get this done and we can play?
(Audience cheers.)
A: That was awesome Joe!
B: You really think so?
A: I really do! It wasn't so hard, was it?
B: No, once I tried to speak to her the way I'd like to be spoken to, it was easy as pie! Speaking of which,
I’m going to go find my sister and suggest we help mom make a pie for supper.
A: Great idea. Pie. I love pie. Good thing you won’t have that duct tape over your mouth anymore.
B: It sure would be bad to miss out on pie. (B starts to go)
A: Remember that “Do unto others…?”
B: Yeah. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

A: Suppose I was making a pie for supper. What would you want me to ask you?
B: I would want you to invite me over to have some pie. (Laughing) I’ll ask my mom and see if it’s OK
for you to come over. Having you around will help me remember how to speak to my sister and
everybody else.

A Tale Of Two Thanksgivings
CHARACTERS: 5, 2 are children and one child’s part is non speaking
PROPS: Can be done pantomime. Having a movie board is effective
COSTUMES: Street clothes
SETTING: Movie set of a home
(Mother, father, two kids getting ready for Thanksgiving dinner. Father pantomimes reading,
mother is cooking, two children are helping set the table, etc. during both halves of the skits.
Actions should stay consistent with both run- throughs).
PART A
DIRECTOR: Places please. (Cast moves into position) Lights! Camera! Action!
FATHER: (Reading the newspaper) How close are we to dinner? I don’t want to miss the
football game afterward.
MOTHER: It won’t be long. I’m just waiting for the pies. (Children get big grins)
FATHER: One for you three, and two all for me! (Children scowl at father)
MOTHER: Set the table now, kids. We need six places.
CHILD: Six?
FATHER: Yeah, one for each of you and three for me. I intend to pig out.
CHILD: Should we use the good china?
MOTHER: No sense doing that when it’s just family
FATHER: (Reading from paper) Listen to this “Approximately 2 in every nine people will have no
Thanksgiving dinner or will have to go to a shelter to have one”. I’m glad we have our own
dinner.
CHILD: All this food - just for us.
MOTHER: Even with the turkey, stuffing, potatoes, gravy, cranberries, green beans, squash,
cheddar biscuits and pies with whipped cream I can’t help feeling something is missing. Maybe I
should have made cranberry bread or that cranberry Jell-O your mom used to do.

FATHER: Which pie are we sending over to the Wilson’s?
MOTHER: They’re all pumpkin so it doesn’t matter. Set the table now, kids. We need six
places.
CHILD: Six?
FATHER: Yeah, one for each of us and two for our guests. .
CHILD: Should we use the good china?
MOTHER: Of course. We’re having company.
FATHER: (Reading from paper) Listen to this “Approximately 2 in every nine people will have no
Thanksgiving dinner or will have to go to a shelter to have one. I’m glad we thought to invite
Betty and James.
CHILD: Yes, they would have had no one to celebrate with since Betty is a widow and James is in
the Navy and a long way from home.
MOTHER: I can’t help feeling this is going to be the best Thanksgiving ever.
CHILD: You mean because of the turkey, stuffing, potatoes, gravy, cranberries, green beans,
squash, cheddar biscuits and pies with whipped cream?
MOTHER: No, because we included the most important ingredient - love.
DIRECTOR: Cut! I think we got it right this time. That’s a wrap.

A Dozen Decisions, One True God
What if…. If only
By Kathy Applebee

CHARACTERS: 12 F, doubling possible
COSTUMES: Period
SETTING: Bare stage
SCRIPTUE: Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near
in the valley of decision. Joel 3:14
DELILAH
Five thousand, 500 pieces of silver. I can buy a lot with 5500 pieces of silver. But I can’t buy
happiness. I can’t buy peace. I can’t go back and change where I have done.
You would think that I have it all. I am beautiful. I’m intelligent; I know how to use my charm
to get what I want. I had influence over all the rulers of my time. And with that power I was
able to get this - 5500 shekels of silver.
Beauty is fleeting and charm is deceptive and one day I will lose them both. Even if I invest this
5500 pieces of silver wisely, it will one day turn to dust. But not before I will.
And after I die what will become me?
If only I haven’t sold the man who loved me into the hands of the Philistines. If only I had
looked beyond what he was to what he could have been. What if I had seen what Simpson could
be, strong, not just in a physical sense, but strong in the power of the Lord?
What if I had thrown my lot in with Israel, like Rahab did?
Rahab and I had much in common: prostitutes, harboring political criminals, a decision that
would change the entire course of our lives based on what we did with these men.
What does it profit one, to gain the whole world and lose one’s soul?
I made my choice. I have 5000, 500 pieces of silver.
SAPPHIRA
If only I hadn’t lied. If only I had convinced my husband Ananias to tell the truth. But if onlys
will not bring us back from the grave.

King Solomon one said “Whoever loves money never has enough; whoever loves wealth is
never satisfied with their income.” How true. How true. And the lord hates lying lips.

When we sold our property, the money was at our disposal. We certainly had every right to keep
all of it or to keep part of it back and give part to the Lord. But we lied about it and now we’re
dead.
I knew my husband intended to lie and keep back part of the money. It doesn’t matter why –
whether he was trying to look big in the eyes of the apostles or trying to be another Barnabas.
Was it Satan? Or was it me? It doesn’t really matter because we are both dead.
If only I had encouraged him to tell the truth. Or maybe I should have encouraged him to give
the whole sum, trusting God more. Maybe I should have told the truth myself and feared God
more than my husband’s opinion of me.
If only I had encouraged my husband to do the right thing and had the courage to do it myself.
PUAH & SHIPRAH
PUAH: (Timid, even frightened) When messengers from Pharaoh came, I could scarcely breathe,
I was so scared.
SHIPRAH: (Strong, defiant) Civil disobedience. That’s what you call it. But in Egypt thousands
of years ago, it was simply defying authority, defying the Pharaoh’s orders.
PUAH: The king of Egypt had told us that when we helped the Hebrew women during childbirth
and saw that the baby is a boy, we were to kill him. If it was a girl, we could let her live. But
Shiprah and I chose to disobey the king.
SHIPRAH: We may be slaves, but Pharaoh doesn’t own our souls. God does.
PUAH: When we were brought before him, my knees shook so badly I could hardly stand. I
would have thrown up, except I already had when word came & his soldiers took me to the
palace. Thank God, Shiprah was right there beside me.
SHIPRAH: (Mocking the voice of Pharaoh) “Why have you done this? Why have you let the
boys live?”
PUAH: (Standing straight, in an unwavering voice, very unlike her timid voice) “Hebrew women
are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive.”
(pause, with a big smile) That was it. He let us go. We went on with our lives and God gave
them families of their own.

SHIPRAH: We weren’t the first or the last to defy human authority to obey God. Did Daniel
think of us when ordered not to pray? Did our actions help Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
when facing the king? Peter and the disciples before the Sanhedrin?
PUAH: (joyfully) The God we serve is able to deliver us,
PUAH & SHIPRAH: (in unison) and he does deliver us.
EVE
Why did I listen to the serpent? Why did I let him deceive me? And why, oh why, did I drag my
husband Adam into it as well?
Now we are cast out of the garden, the perfect garden of Eden. My husband labors hard every
day, fighting against weeds and thorns to feed us. Not only is my pain in childbirth great, but I
have doomed all my daughters to the same pain, generation after generation.
And worst of all I have brought sin into the world to haunt all generations that follow me. Why
did I listen to the evil serpent? What if I had made a different choice?

JOB’S WIFE
What if? What if I had encouraged my husband instead of advising him to curse God and die? I
guess I’ll never know.
SARAH
If only I had had the patience and the faith of my husband Abraham. If only I had waited on the
Lord. If I had hoped in the LORD, he would have renewed my strength. Yes, the strength of a
90 year old woman. I would have soared on wings like eagles; I would have run and not grown
weary, I would have walked and not grown faint.
If only I had not leaned on my own understanding and came up with a plan for Hagar to have a
baby for me. If Ishmael had not been born, then the Edomites would not have been a thorn in the
side of Israel for generations after generation. How could I have known that one decision would
have such terrible repercussions?
If only I had waited on the Lord.
ESTHER

Do you ever look back on your life and wonder what would have happened if…? I do. I wonder
where relief and deliverance for the Jews would have come, if I had not risked my life and gone
before the king.
Mordecai is convinced that had I chosen to remain silent, that aid for the Jews would have come
another way. I’m sure he’s right. Mordecai always did the right thing, even if it could have cost
him his life.
Mordecai asked me “And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a
time as this?” But I can’t help wondering … What if I had looked around at the physical things,
at my position, my power, my possessions instead of looking beyond to my people and my God?
Did you know that when I faced that big decision it really wasn’t all that hard to make? I had
year of practice obeying Mordecai in the small everyday things. He never steered me wrong. It
came naturally to obey him in this.
That’s how it is with obedience. When you obey the Lord in little things, day after day, every
day, the big decisions, the risky obedience, comes easily.
What would have happened if I had not spoken up for my people? I don’t know. And I am so
thankful I will never find out.
BATHSHEBA
Thirty minutes. Have you ever wondered what a difference 30 minutes might make? It could
steer the entire course of your life on another path.
What if I had taken my bath just 30 minutes later? Instead of evening, it would have been night.
No one, not even a king, could have seen me bathing on my roof if I had waited another 30
minutes.
SALOME
If someone promised to give you anything you wanted, and they were rich and powerful enough
to deliver up just about anything you could ask for, what, (pause) what would you ask for?
God asked Solomon that question.
At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream, and God said, “Ask for whatever you
want me to give you.” Solomon asked for wisdom. The Lord was pleased so God said to him,
“Since you have asked for this and not for long life or wealth for yourself, nor have asked for the
death of your enemies but for discernment in administering justice, I will do what you have
asked. I will give you a wise and discerning heart, so that there will never have been anyone like

you, nor will there ever be. Moreover, I will give you what you have not asked for—both wealth
and honor—so that in your lifetime you will have no equal among kings.
What would you have asked for?
King Herod asked me that question. (remembers, painfully and regretfully, self-loathing
apparent on her face)
And I asked for the head of John, the one they called the baptizer, on a platter. (Looks afar,
shakes head in disbelief)
I could have asked for anything, up to half his kingdom, and I asked for John’s head on a platter.
(remembering and gazing gat her hands holding an imaginary platter) And as I carried the
gristly gift back to my mother, his blood spilled onto my hands. (Looking at audience) I washed
them, but the stain will never come off. (holding out hands) His blood will be on my hands and
head forever.
If only I had asked for something else.
RAHAB
As I stood in the crowd of Israelites gathered before Joshua at Shechem, my children pressed
around me, listening as he recounted the escape from Egypt, crossing the Red Sea and the
Jordan, taking Jericho and defeating 30 more kings. I too had heard those stories as a child,
mouth open in awe. As an adult from my home on the city wall I had watched the Jordan ripped
open as they marched across.
Then Joshua’s voice thundered out: choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether
the gods your ancestors served beyond the Euphrates, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land
you are living.
And I thought, I made my choice years ago. I could have turned the Israelite spies over to the
king of Jericho and been applauded as a good citizen. But I choose not to. When every other
heart in Jericho melted in fear and everyone’s courage failed, my resolve grew stronger.
I knew the LORD their God was God in heaven above and on the earth below. I put my trust in
Him, threw my lot in with the spies and made my choice.
And as Joshua finished (Joshua voice) But as for me and my household, we will serve the
LORD, I said those words right along with him in my heart.
Had I not made that choice, I would be dead.
RUTH

One of your modern day poets once wrote “two roads diverged in a yellow wood and sorry I
could not travel both. I took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference.”
I too faced two roads. One well-traveled way that would lead me back home, to Moab, to the
familiar, to my family by blood. The other, less traveled led to a foreign land, an uncertain
reception, the great unknown.
My sister in law Orpah chose to go home. I chose to go with Naomi to Israel and that made all
the difference.
Joshua once spoke to the Israelites saying “choose this day whom you will serve, but as for me
and my house we will serve the lord.” Even though I never met the man, even though I only had
heard stories from Naomi, I knew that when the time came to make a choice, I would choose the
Lord, no matter what path led to Him.
ALL: Multitudes, multitudes
in the valley of decision!
For the day of the LORD is near
in the valley of decision.

STARS IN THE CHRISTMAS EVE SKY
By Kathy Applebee

CAST (either version)
TWINKLE - (A hyperactive show off who never stops moving entirely. All of Twinkle’s lines are
delivered fast)
GLITTER: - (Vain, showy, insecure, diva type)
SPARKLE (Aristocratic snob star, aloof and elegant)
BETH - The Star of Bethlehem (Wise and kind)
SIRIUS - Dog Star (Bossy, loud and assertive)
MR. SANDMAN: - (Nervous, almost hysterical wreck. Everything is a crisis. Carries a clipboard and
has a large watch or hourglass with sand)
NO NAME (Sweet, innocent, young, small - child’s part)

Stars in the Christmas Eve Sky
At Rise: A busy heavenly department. Sign read “Stellar Departures”. The atmosphere is busy and
rushed like backstage before a play.
MR. SANDMAN:
(Yelling even though there is no one around except No Name) Places please! Everyone! Places! Sol is
sinking fast! You know how quickly night falls in the winter. It’s just three days after the solstice.
Christmas Eve! (Bumping into NO NAME) Ooof. (Bewildered) Who are you? What are you doing
here? Are you a new star?
NO NAME: (Shrugging) I guess so.
MR. SANDMAN: Well, you’re not very big, (Glitter sweeps in) and you’re not very shiny. (NO NAME
just shrugs again while Glitter waltzes and twirls around her gathering attention like moths to a light.
Sandman frantically searches through clipboard. The rest of this line he mutters underneath GLITTER’s
lines) I don’t have any paperwork about a new star. No notification. How am I supposed to know what
to do?
GLITTER: (Taking center stage) And stars must be shiny, brilliant, glittering like me. I’m Glitter, the
most important star in the Alpha Centauri quadrant. (Twirls and shows off some more)
SPARKLE: (Regally entering and stepping in front of Glitter to take center stage) You certainly are not.
I am the brightest, most distinguished star in the Alpha Centuri quadrant. (Sparkle twirls)

MR. SANDMAN: Please! Please! We haven’t time for this. Glitter, darling, you seem tarnished
tonight. (Sparkle gloats)
GLITTER: (Bursting into tears). It’s that smog! That horrible awful smog. People just keep polluting
and ruining the sky. It’s bad enough we have clouds but now all this pollution. What are those humans
doing to the world God made them?
MR. SANDMAN: But the humans need the clouds to bring them rain and snow. They couldn’t live
without them.
GLITTER: But all the smog is unnecessary and just .makes me drab (Bursts into sobs. MR. SANDMAN
pats her and hands her a hankie)
MR. SANDMAN: Well sweetie, run along and get polished up. We can’t have a crying tarnished star,
now can we? Of course not. (GLITTER leaves, wiping her eyes)
Sparkle: She just can’t keep up, I’m afraid, with me. (To NO NAME) I set the standard for the other
stars, you know. I’m Sparkle and I do so sparkle. I am the Prima Dona, the role model, the...
SIRIUS: (Strutting in and cutting her off) I think not. I am THE brightest star in the galaxy. Numero
Uno. The Alpha. Premier. (Sparkle miffs him). SIRIUS, the North Star, the Dog star. (Poses like a
superhero) People all over the world depend on my appearance to get them to the right place. Why,
without me, mankind would be lost.
NO NAME: Lost?
SIRIUS: Yes, lost. Before all those inventions humans have today, they relied on the stars to guide
them. No one dared venture across the sea or an ocean or anywhere out of sight of land without their
star charts. If they were going to cross the desert, they needed to be guided by the stars too. You see, by
knowing where we are, they know where they are and how to get where they are going.
NO NAME: That sounds like an important job.
SIRIUS: Of course it is. And I am the key star to all directions. Me, SIRIUS! (Grumbling) Until those
people invented maps and compasses and GPS. Now they don’t seem to need us stars as much anymore.
GLITTER: (Entering, insecure, looking for approval) I’m back. Do I look any better? I had them use a
whole pot of polish. I hope I glitter like I used to.
MR. SANDMAN: You look just fine, dahling.
SPARKLE: You look as good as (Slight hesitation) you usually do (Mumbles)

GLITTER: What was that you mumbled? Was that some wise remark?
SPARKLE:
All I said was you look as good as you usually do.
GLITTER: What do you mean by that!? (Start to get in a fight)
MR. SANDMAN: Stop! Stop! It’s almost time for you stars to take your places! We don’t have time
for all this... this... this bickering!
SPARKLE: (Melodramatically) I cannot go back to my spot. I just can’t. The brown cloud over Denver
tarnishes me. I want a transfer over Australia’s outback or better yet Antarctica. There’s no pollution to
speak of there.
GLITTER: And no people to admire you either. (To MR. SANDMAN) If anyone deserves a transfer, it’s
me. For almost a month now I have had to compete with all those Christmas lights. People are so busy
looking at them they forget to look at me. The audacity.
SPARKLE: No! I should be transferred (They a start to argue. SIRIUS breaks it up)
SIRIUS: Enough! Everyone is staying where they were assigned in the beginning. That’s how God set
the universe up. Everything in its appointed place.
MR. SANDMAN: But this one (Indicates NO NAME) has no assigned place. (Continues to mumble to
himself, searches through clipboard and everywhere. All the stars ignore him)
SPARKLE: (Pouting) He made an exception (Pause) that one time.
GLITTER: Yes, He did. And right around this time of year.
SIRIUS: That was because His son was being born. That was a onetime thing.
MR. SANDMAN: We don’t have time for this, we don’t have time. What are we going to do with her
(Pointing at NO NAME) She didn’t come with any instructions about where I should put her. (To NO
NAME) Have you had any star training?
NO NAME: No.
GLITTER: Well I certainly can’t have her follow me. I have enough to worry about. My brightness, my
glittering. I wouldn’t be called Glitter without my glittering beams.

SPARKLE: I certainly can’t be responsible for her. I must pay attention to my radiance and my sparkle.
That’s why I’m called Sparkle.
SIRIUS: Stick her with Twinkle. (calling to her off stage) Twinkle! (Twinkle rushes in, bouncing,
talking loudly and rapidly and never standing still)
TWINKLE: Did I hear my name called? Twinkle! That’s me. Did somebody call Twinkle? (Sing
song) Twinkle, Twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are. Up above...
MR. SANDMAN: I don’t have time for this. Save it for later, Twinkle. Sirius, (Pointing to his watch)
its time. (SIRIUS puffs himself up and exits boldly)
SPARKLE: I’m next. (To NO NAME) Do I look alright? Can you see any tarnish? Soot? Pollution?
(Each time NO NAME shakes her head and says “No”)
MR. SANDMAN:  Shine bright all night, Sparkle. (Sparkle exits) Glitter, are you ready?
Then off you go. (She exits. MR. SANDMAN turns to Twinkle.) I have to go find out who and where she
(Points to NO NAME) goes. You don’t go out for awhile explain the ropes to her the best you can.
TWINKLE: Gotcha (MR. SANDMAN Exits. Twinkle speaks rapidly with zest and excitement) I’m
Twinkle. I’m sure you have heard of me. I am the most talked about, sung about, wished upon star in all
the galaxies.
NO NAME: (Impressed) OH
TWINKLE: Surely you have heard... (Singing) Twinkle, Twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
U p above the world so bright
Like a diamond in the night.
Twinkle. twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are.
That’s me - Twinkle.
Sometimes they chant (Chanting)
Starlight, Star bright
First star I see tonight.
I wish I may. I wish I might
Have the wish I wish tonight.
Sometimes it’s about me because they see me first. Usually it’s Sirius you know, the north star, the dog
star, Mr. Number One as he likes to call himself.
NO NAME: Can I wish on you? I’d wish Mr. Sandman would find a place for me. And a name.

TWINKLE: Sure, go ahead. No wait. It won’t work. I’m not the first star you saw tonight. I have to
be the first. Nope. Sorry. Oh, look, here comes the Star of Bethlehem. Real class act, that one. (To
Beth) Good Evening, Beth (To NO NAME) Beth - that’s what I call her. Its short for Bethlehem (To
Beth) Wow, can you believe the Christmas season is almost over? Not as exciting as the one two
thousand some years ago, is it? That was your year to shine, wasn’t it?
BETH: Yes. (To NO NAME) And who might you be?
TWINKLE: (Plunging in, interrupting before NO NAME can say a word) Don’t know. She doesn’t
have a name. Or assignment. Sandman went to find out. She showed up with no instructions, no
training, NO NAME. Just appeared. Like out of nowhere. Poof. Here she was. Just like that. Poof.
MR. SANDMAN: (Entering in a bustle) Dear, oh, dear. I still don’t know what I am supposed to do
with this one (Indicating NO NAME) But right now we have to get you (Indicating Twinkle) out into the
night sky.  Shine bright all night.
TWINKLE: (Bouncing off, chattering away as voice fades away) Bye for now. See ya around. (spins)
Later...
MR. SANDMAN: Beth, you look wonderful, as always. The Christmas season is almost over. Are you
sad?
BETH: No. I keep Christmas in my heart all year long.
NO NAME: (Tugging on MR. SANDMAN’s coat) What about me sir? What’s to become of me?
MR. SANDMAN: That’s just it. I don’t know. There was nothing in the orders about a new star
tonight. Beth, be a dear. I have to go find someone who knows what’s going on. Can you see yourself
out if I’m not back?
BETH: Of course. (MR. SANDMAN nods and exits; to NO NAME) Now, what shall we do with you?
You are quite little to be a star. I wonder, maybe you have some special purpose like I did.
NO NAME: Can I ask you a question?
BETH: Of Course.
NO NAME: The other stars seem kind of stuck up. Why do they act like that?
BETH: I don’t think they realize that the stars are NOT here to glorify themselves but God. Stars are to
give direction, not be the center of attention.

NO NAME: How do stars glorify God?
BETH: When people look up at the heavens and see us, they can marvel at the One who made us.
Sometimes we have special purposes as well.
NO NAME: What was your special purpose?
BETH: Two thousand and some years ago I appeared in the sky where no star was ever seen before.
You see, Jesus, the son of God was to be born in Bethlehem. God wanted the wise men to be able to
find him but they had to travel a very far distance on a route they had never traveled before. God chose
me to lead them to a stable in Bethlehem where Jesus would be born.
NO NAME: That sounds very important. Sirius told me people are guided by the stars when they travel.
He also said stars had assigned places.
BETH: That’s true. But I was an exception to the rule. Exceptions for an exceptional birth, an
exceptional event. You see, Jesus is the center of everything. Nothing in this world is as important as
Jesus and it was most important for the wise men to find him. For that special occasion I out-shown all
other stars and moved to lead people to the Christ, the son of God. Then after they had found him I went
back to my assigned place. I lost that special shine too but it didn’t matter. I will always treasure being
part of leading people to Jesus.
NO NAME: I’ll do my best to be a good star. I want to be the kind of star that glorifies God and leads
people to Jesus.
MR. SANDMAN ;( Flustered, entering in a hurry) No you won’t. You won’t be a star at all. This was a
mistake. A big mistake. You aren’t going to be a star at all. You are going to be a human being. You
know, one of the people on earth. Somebody made a mistake and sent you here. Your parents are
expecting you. I just need to finish my paperwork and then I’ll take you to your departure point. (Gets
busy with clipboard, watch, etc)
NO NAME: (Disappointed) Oh.
BETH: (comforting her) Don’t be disappointed or sad. God made you to be a human and He doesn’t
make mistakes. Just because you’re not a star doesn’t mean you can’t glorify God.
NO NAME: Really?
BETH: Really. People may have maps and compasses to help them find their way around earth but they
still need someone to lead them to Jesus. That’s a job for human beings. Not the stars.

NO NAME: Then that is what I’ll do. I’ll do my very best to lead people to Jesus.
BETH: Good. I’m glad I met you. You reminded me of Christmas Eve 2000 and some years ago when
another set of parents, Mary and Joseph, were waiting for Jesus to be born. Now you must excuse me.
It’s my time to enter the night sky. I’ll be watching you as you are born. I’ll be watching every night,
watching as you lead people to Jesus just like I did over two thousand years ago.
NO NAME; And I’ll be watching you. Whenever I see you in the night sky I’ll remember about leading
people to Jesus. (They hug and Beth exits)
MR. SANDMAN: Ok. (Checking off clipboard) She’s the last star. (Big sigh of relief) Now (Noticeably
less stressed, taking NO NAME hand). Let’s get you to the right place. You have two people - your
parents - who are very eager to have you arrive but you’ll have to leave from a different department.
Come on.
(Curtain)

STARS (after Christmas version)

SPARKLE: She just can’t keep up, I’m afraid, with me. (To NO NAME) I set the standard for the other
stars, you know. I’m Sparkle and I do so sparkle. I am the Prima Dona, the role model, the...
SIRIUS: (Strutting in and cutting her off) I think not. I am THE brightest star in the galaxy. Numero
Uno. The Alpha. Premier. (Sparkle miffs him). Sirius, the North Star, the Dog Star. (Poses like a
superhero) People all over the world depend on my appearance to get them to the right place. Why,
without me, mankind would be lost.
NO NAME: Lost?
SIRIUS: Yes, lost. Before all those inventions humans have today, they relied on the stars to guide
them. No one dared venture across the sea or an ocean or anywhere out of sight of land without their
star charts. If they were going to cross the desert, they needed to be guided by the stars too. You see, by
knowing where we are, they know where they are and how to get where they are going.
NO NAME: That sounds like an important job.
SIRIUS: Of course it is. And I am the key star to all directions. Me, Sirius! (Grumbling) Until those
people invented maps and compasses and GPS. Now they don’t seem to need us stars as much anymore.
GLITTER: (Entering, insecure, looking for approval) I’m back. Do I look any better? I had them use a
whole pot of polish. I hope I glitter like I used to.
MR. SANDMAN: You look just fine, dahling.
SPARKLE: You look as good as (Slight hesitation) you usually do (Mumbles)
GLITTER: What was that you mumbled? Was that some wise remark?

SPARKLE: All I said was you look as good as you usually do.
GLITTER: What do you mean by that!? (Start to get in a fight)
MR. SANDMAN: Stop! Stop! It’s almost time for you stars to take your places! We don’t have time
for all this... this... this bickering!
SPARKLE: (Melodramatically) I cannot go back to my spot. I just can’t. The brown cloud over
Denver tarnishes me. I want a transfer over Australia’s outback or better yet Antarctica. There’s no
pollution to speak of there.
GLITTER: And no people to admire you either. (To MR. SANDMAN) If anyone deserves a transfer, it’s
me. For almost a month now I have had to compete with all those Christmas lights. People are so busy
looking at them they forget to look at me. The audacity.
SPARKLE: No! I should be transferred (They a start to argue. SIRIUS breaks it up)
SIRIUS: Enough! Everyone is staying where they were assigned in the beginning. That’s how God set
the universe up. Everything in its appointed place.
SPARKLE: (Pouting) He made an exception (Pause) that one time.
GLITTER: Yes, He did. And right around this time of year. Beth got to move all around the night sky.
SIRIUS: That was because His son was being born. That was a onetime thing.
MR. SANDMAN: We don’t have time for this, we don’t have time. What are we going to do with her
(Pointing at NO NAME) She didn’t come with any instructions about where I should put her. (To NO
NAME) Have you had any star training?
NO NAME: No
GLITTER: Well I certainly can’t have her follow me. I have enough to worry about. My brightness, my
glittering. I wouldn’t be called Glitter without my glittering beams.
SPARKLE: I certainly can’t be responsible for her. I must pay attention to my radiance and my sparkle.
That’s why I’m called Sparkle.
SIRIUS: Stick her with Twinkle. (calling off stage) Twinkle!
TWINKLE: (Twinkle rushes in, bouncing, talking loudly and rapidly and never standing still) Did I

hear my name called? Twinkle! That’s me. Did somebody call Twinkle? (Sing song) Twinkle,
Twinkle little star, how I wonder what you are. Up above...
MR. SANDMAN: I don’t have time for this. Save it for later Twinkle. Sirius - (Pointing to his watch)
its time. (SIRIUS puffs himself up and exits boldly)
SPARKLE: I’m next. (To NO NAME) Do I look alright? Can you see any tarnish? Soot? Pollution?
(Each time NO NAME shakes her head and says “No”)
MR. SANDMAN:  Shine bright all night, Sparkle. (Sparkle exits) Glitter, are you ready?
Then off you go. (She exits. MR. SANDMAN: turns to Twinkle.) I have to go find out who and where
she (Points to NO NAME) goes. You don’t go out for a while explain the ropes to her the best you can.
TWINKLE: Gotcha (MR. SANDMAN: Exits) I’m Twinkle. I’m sure you have heard of me. I am the
most talked about, sung about, wished upon star in all the galaxies.
NO NAME: (Impressed) Ohh!
TWINKLE:
Surely you have heard... (Singing) Twinkle, Twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so bright
Like a diamond in the night.
Twinkle. Twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are.
That’s me - Twinkle.
Sometimes they chant (Chanting)
Starlight, Star bright
First star I see tonight.
I wish I may. I wish I might
Have the wish I wish tonight.
Sometimes it’s about me because they see me first. Usually it’s Sirius you know, the North Star, the
Dog Star, Mr. Number One as he likes to call himself.
NO NAME: Can I wish on you? I’d wish Mr. Sandman would find a place for me. And a name.
TWINKLE: Sure, go ahead. No wait. It won’t work. I’m not the first star you saw tonight. I have to
be the first. Nope. Sorry. Oh, look, here comes the Star of Bethlehem. Real class act, that one. (To
Beth) Good Evening, Beth (To NO NAME) Beth - that’s what I call her. Its short for Bethlehem (To
Beth) Wow, can you believe Christmas is over for this year? Not as exciting as the one two thousand
some years ago, is it? That was your year to shine, wasn’t it?

BETH: Yes. (Kindly to NO NAME) And who might you be?
TWINKLE: (Plunging in, interrupting before NO NAME can say a word) Don’t know. She doesn’t
have a name. Or assignment. Sandman went to find out. She showed up with no instructions, no
training, No name. Just appeared. Like out of nowhere. Poof. Here she was. Just like that. Poof.
MR. SANDMAN: (Entering in a bustle) Dear, oh, dear. I still don’t know what I am supposed to do
with this one (Indicating NO NAME) but right now we have to get you (Indicating Twinkle) out into the
night sky.  Shine bright all night.
TWINKLE: (Bouncing off, chattering away as voice fades away) Bye for now. See ya around. (twirls
once) Later...
MR. SANDMAN: Beth, you look wonderful, as always. The Christmas season is almost over. Are you
sad?
BETH: No. I keep Christmas in my heart all year long.
NO NAME: (Tugging on MR. SANDMAN:’s coat) What about me, sir? What’s to become of me?
MR. SANDMAN: That’s just it. I don’t know. (rifles through clipboard) There was nothing in the
orders about a new star tonight. (looks up from clipboard) Beth, be a dear. I have to go find someone
who knows what’s going on. Can you see yourself out if I’m not back?
BETH: Of course. (MR. SANDMAN nods and rushes off)
BETH: Now, what shall we do with you? You are quite little to be a star. I wonder, maybe you have
some special purpose like I did.
NO NAME: What was your special purpose?
BETH: Two thousand and some years ago I appeared in the sky where no star was ever seen before.
You see, Jesus, the son of God was to be born in Bethlehem. God wanted the wise men to be able to
find him but they had to travel a very far distance on a route they had never traveled before. God chose
me to lead them to a stable in Bethlehem where Jesus would be born.
NO NAME: That sounds very important. Sirius told me people are guided by the stars when they travel.
He also said stars had assigned places.
BETH: That’s true. But I was an exception to the rule. Exceptions for an exceptional birth, an
exceptional event. You see, Jesus is the center of everything. He created everything in the entire
universe. Nothing in this world is as important as Jesus and it was most important for the wise men to

find him.
NO NAME: Maybe I’m going to have an important job too. (Pause) Can I ask you a question?
BETH: Of course.
NO NAME: The other stars seem kind of stuck up. Why do they act like that?
BETH: I don’t think they realize that the stars are NOT here to glorify themselves but God. Stars are to
give direction, not be the center of attention.
NO NAME: I’ll do my best to be a good star. I want to be the kind of star that glorifies God and leads
people to Jesus.
MR. SANDMAN: (Flustered, entering in a hurry) No, you won’t. You won’t be a star at all. This was a
mistake. A big mistake. You aren’t going to be a star at all. You are going to be a human being. You
know, one of the people on earth. Somebody made a mistake and sent you here. Your parents are
expecting you. I just need to finish my paperwork and then I’ll take you to your departure point. (Gets
busy with clipboard, watch, etc.)
NO NAME: (Disappointed) Oh.
BETH: Don’t be disappointed or sad. God made you to be a human and He doesn’t make mistakes. Just
because you’re not a star doesn’t mean you can’t glorify God.
NO NAME: Really?
BETH: Really. People may have maps and compasses to help them find their way around earth but they
still need someone to lead them to Jesus. That’s a job for human beings. Not the stars.
NO NAME: Then that is what I’ll do. I’ll do my very best to lead people to Jesus.
BETH: Good. Now you must excuse me. It’s my time to enter the night sky. I’ll be watching you as
you are born and as you grow up. I’ll be watching as you lead wise people to Jesus just like I did two
thousand and some years ago.
NO NAME: And I’ll be watching you. Whenever I see you in the night sky I’ll remember about leading
people to Jesus. (They hug and Beth exits)
MR. SANDMAN: Ok. (Checking off clipboard) She’s the last star. (Big sigh of relief) Now (Noticeably
less stressed, taking NO NAME hand). Let’s get you to the right place. You have two people - your
parents - who are very eager to have you arrive but you’ll have to leave from a different department.

THE BIRTH OF JESUS FORETOLD
SCENE 1 (before the curtain)
NICODEMUS: (Standing center stage in spot light)
Four hundred years. Four hundred years and we had not had a word from God. I, Nicodemus, a
member of the Sanhedrin, the ruling body of the Jews, was acutely aware of another 400 year
period in our history. My people had been enslaved in Egypt for 400 years. I was also acutely
aware of our current occupation by the Romans. I, like my Jewish brethren, was looking for the
coming Messiah to restore the kingdom to Israel. (Moves stage left)
But it had been 400 years since my people had the word of the Lord. Four hundred years of
silence. When the word of the Lord came, it was not to the high priest, or a member of the
Sanhedrin or even a prophet. It was to an obscure young woman in the tiny town of Nazareth.
To most, she was nothing remarkable. But to God, she stood out among all women. For the
LORD does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the
LORD looks at the heart. (Freeze, spot off)
GABRIEL’S VISIT SCENE 2 (before the curtain)
Spot up on MARY who is sweeping the floor stage left. After 2 beats another spot hits GABRIEL
center stage. She looks up, drops the broom in amazement, then bows before him.
GABRIEL:
Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you. (Mary looks up in amazement and
fear.)
GABRIEL:
Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God. You will be with child and give birth to
a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the
Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, (enough emphasis so
when this is later quoted during Salome’s Sorrow the audience remembers) and he will reign
over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end.
MARY:
How will this be since I am a virgin?
GABRIEL:
The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. The

holy one to be born will be called the Son of God. Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a
child in her old age, and she who was said to be barren is in her sixth month. For nothing is
impossible with God
MARY:
I am the Lord's servant. May it be to me as you have said. (Spots off GABRIEL)
(Mary stands and praises God)
My soul glorifies the Lord
and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
for he has been mindful
of the humble state of his servant.
From now on all generations will call me blessed,
for the Mighty One has done great things for me—
holy is his name.
(Spot off MARY, back on NICODEMUS.)
NICODEMUS:
Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world. So
Joseph went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David,
because he belonged to the house and line of David. He went there to register with Mary, who
was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. While they were there, the time
came for the baby to be born, and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in
cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn. There were
shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.
BETHLEHEM SCENE 3
(Curtains open with Gabriel center stage backed by the choir in angel robes standing
powerfully. The choir sings. – “Joy to the World” verse one and two. Choir hums during
spoken dialogue.
Other songs to consider for this scene: “Angels from the Realms of Glory”, “The Flocks were
wrapped in Slumber”,” In the fields their Flocks Abiding”, “Rise Up Shepherd and Follow”,
“While Shepherds Watched their Flocks”, “While their Flocks the Shepherds Tended.”
Shepherds notice Gabriel and are frightened, the younger ones scurrying into the protective
embrace of an older shepherd.
GABRIEL:
Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. Today in the

town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ, the Lord. This will be a sign to you:
You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.
ANGEL VOICE 1: (from the choir): Glory to God in the highest!
ANGEL VOICE 2: (From the choir) And on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests
Choir sings “Hark, the Herald Angels Sing, verse one” while the shepherds look to each other in
wonderment and listen to the choir of angels. JOSEPH quietly enter next to MARY)
SHEPHERD 1:
Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.
(Shepherds exit left. Angel Choir sings “Rise Up, Shepherd and Follow”, then the second and
third verses of “Hark, the Herald Angels Sing” while the following occurs without dialogue.
Lights on the choir are dim to focus attention on MARY, JOSEPH, stage right during the song.
Mary lays Jesus in a manger, Joseph and Mary bow to pray, then raise their heads and hands to
God. Shepherds enter, bow and exit. Magi enter from the back and bow before the family)
NICODEMUS:
Once again the news had not come to the high and mighty, to the priests or teachers of the law
but to shepherds. And to Gentiles.
MAGI 1:
Here is the one who has been born king of the Jews. We saw his star in the east and have come
to worship him.
MAGI 2:
It has been said that in the land of Judah,
one will come who is a ruler
one who will be the shepherd of the people of Israel
(Song “Hail, Thou Source of Every Blessing”, “by Magi, Can be backed by the choir. Magi can
have servants who lend their voices as well) Curtain closes. Choir changes into Biblical
costumes. NICODEMUS in front of curtain)
NICODEMUS SCENE 4 (before the curtain)
NICODEMUS:
The good news spread as far as the palace of King Herod. He did not rejoice at the news of a
rival king. He sent out soldiers to destroy any threats to his throne. It was a time of sadness for

those who lost their infants and toddlers.
For another thirty years we heard nothing.
Then a powerful prophet began preaching in the desert, a powerful man. Wearing camel’s hair
and a leather belt, dining on locusts and wild honey– John brought the word of the Lord and was
baptizing people for the remission of their sins in the Jordan River. He told us the Messiah was
about to be revealed. (NICODEMUS inserts himself into the scene once the curtain opens)
BAPTISM SCENE 5
(Curtain opens. Rocks in the forefront conceal the area where baptism will take place and water
can be hidden to wet those being baptized. Choir starts “”These are the Days of Elijah”. JOHN
will baptize two people, NICODEMUS will merge with crowd)
PRIEST 1:
Who you are? Are you the Christ?
JOHN:
I am not the Christ
PRIEST 2:
Then who are you? Are you Elijah?
JOHN:
I am not.
NICODEMAS:
Are you the Prophet?"
JOHN:
No.
PRIEST 1:
Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about
yourself?
JOHN:
I am the voice of one calling in the desert, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.

NICODEMAS:
Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?
JOHN:
I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know. The reason I came baptizing
with water was that he might be revealed to Israel. He is the one who comes after me, the thongs
of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with
fire.
(Crowd parts, Jesus steps out)
JOHN:
Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! (John bows to Jesus; Jesus
takes his hand, raises him up and embraces him, moving into the water to be baptized)
JESUS:
I have come to be baptized.
JOHN:
I need to be baptized by you. Why do you come to me?
JESUS:
Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness. (John baptizes him)
VOICE of GOD:
This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. (Dove comes down)
JOHN:
Behold the Lamb of God.
Choir sings another verse of “These are the Days of Elijah” Other disciples are baptized.
NICODEMUS:
From that day on many chose to follow Jesus. I was not one of them
PETER:
But I was.
(Jesus beckons and several follow him. Peter steps out in front of the curtain. Curtain closes
behind him. Choir sings first verse of “Make Christ your King Today”)

NICODEMUS SCENE 6 (before the curtain)
(Lighted to infer darkness. Peter is in narrator stage right position.)
PETER:
Many followed but Jesus chose 12 of us to train, keeping us with him, day and night. For three
years he trained us. He spoke with authority and he served with humility. We were unschooled
ordinary men. Fishermen, a Roman tax collector, often hated as a traitor to his people, and a
zealot, willing to take up arms to rid us of Roman occupation. An unlikely bunch. But by
choosing ordinary men it became obvious it was God’s power working through us, not our own.
The religious leaders grew increasingly annoyed, then hostile toward Jesus. One, Nicodemus, a
Pharisee and member of the Jewish ruling council came one night, in secret.
(Light off PETER and spot on NICODEMUS and JESUS slightly left of down center)
Nicodemus:
Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the
miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him.
JESUS:
I tell you the truth; no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.
Nicodemus.
How can a man be born when he is old? Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's
womb to be born!
JESUS:
I tell you the truth; no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the
Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. You should not be surprised at
my saying, 'You must be born again.' The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound,
but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the
Spirit.
Nicodemus:
How can this be?
JESUS:
You are Israel's teacher. Do you not understand these things? The Son of Man must be lifted up,

that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall
not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the
world, but to save the world through him.
Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness (Uses hands to indicate the darkness
around them, NICODEMUS seems somewhat shamed) instead of light because their deeds were
evil. Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his
deeds will be exposed. But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen
plainly that what he has done has been done through God. (Lights off, they exit, curtain opens)
MIRACLES SCENE 7
(Curtain opens. Choir sings first two verses of “A Cold Heart Turns” by Rebecca St. James
while the crowd filters in, whispering without sound and looking expectantly at each other, and
looking around as if they expect someone. Choir sings chorus only of “Days of Elijah”. During
this song, from the back, Jesus with a few disciples appears. Mood of the crowd changes to
jubilation and excitement. People’s faces light up, they point and their faces reflect the
excitement of seeing him. A few children run to him and he bends down to scoop one up for a
hug, then returning them to the ground. Two children take Jesus’ hands and walk by his side as
he continues to walk, stopping to touch people, touch a child being held out to him as he moves
toward the stage. Curtain opens to reveal the rest of the choir and crowd. Blind men are far
stage left, softly calling once for Jesus to have mercy on them. Crowd will shush them)
MARTHA:
He went through all the towns and villages, teaching in our synagogues, preaching the good
news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. Word of his teaching and miracles
spread like wildfire. Even the Romans occupying our country heard of him and his power.
(inserts herself in scene)
JESUS: (Center stage, children are closest to him, sitting at his feet. A few adults sit as well)
If anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is my disciple, I
tell you the truth, he will certainly not lose his reward.
BLIND MAN 1:
Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
CROWD:
Quiet. Be quiet.

BLIND MAN 1 & 2: (Louder)
Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!
JESUS: (Indicating two of his disciples should lead them to him)
What do you want me to do for you?
BLIND MAN 2:
Lord, we want our sight.
JESUS:
Do you believe that I am able to do this?
BLIND MEN:
Yes, Lord.
JESUS:
According to your faith will it be done to you. (Jesus touches their eyes, they receive their sight
and thank him, the crowd is amazed)
Centurion comes down center aisle. The crowd looks at him with loathing as he kneels before
Jesus. Jesus focuses on him. The crowd grows silent - a Roman kneeling to a Jew?! The
centurion lifts his head and speaks)
CENTURION:
Lord, my servant lies at home paralyzed and in terrible suffering.
JESUS:
I will go and heal him.
CENTURION:
Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant
will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one,
'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does
it."
JESUS:
I tell you the truth; I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. Go! It will be done
just as you believed it would. (Centurion bows his head in reverence and exits center. The
crowd has mixed emotions. Most are either perplexed or unhappy Jesus that has helped a

Roman enemy.
(There is a commotion stage right. The stage right crowd parts to reveal a woman and her
daughter who is shuddering and foaming from demon possession. The girl falls and shudders
once more, then lies as if she is dead. The woman, kneeling by the girl, cradling her as the
seizure subsides, calls out desperately. The crowd reacts with fear and avulsion to this gentile
and the demon. They pull back, holding children in protective embraces.)
CANAANITE WOMAN:
Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is suffering terribly from demon
possession. (Someone in the crowd comes forward and kneels by the girl, gently wiping her
mouth and tending her as the mother goes to Jesus)
JESUS: (Compassionately)
I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.
CANAANITE WOMAN :( Comes and kneels before him, face down. Sobs rack her body. She
lifts her tear streaked face and one hand, imploring him) Lord, help me!
JESUS: (Kneels down to her, gently and expectantly)
It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs.
CANAANITE WOMAN:
Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table
JESUS: (Pulls her to her feet, with evident joy at her response)
Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted. (He indicates the girl with a wave of his
hand. The girl sits up, smiling and unpossessed. The crowd gasps. Mother and child rush into
each other’s arms and embrace)
CENTURION: (Coming from stage left moving right next to Jesus, kneeling)
Lord Jesus! My servant has been healed. At the very moment you spoke of it! (Crowd looks
amazed)
JESUS:
(Crowds faces start to register that maybe he is talking about Gentiles such as the Canaanite
woman’s daughter and the Centurion’s servant. Priests push to the forefront and center stage
for a confrontation.)

He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to him?
NICODEMUS:
These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the
blind?
PRIEST 2: (To Jesus)
How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.
JESUS:
I did tell you, but you do not believe. The miracles I do in my Father's name speak for me. I and
the Father are one.
PRIEST 1:
Blasphemy! You, a mere man, claim to be God.
JESUS:
I am the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world Why then do you
accuse me of blasphemy because I said, 'I am God's Son'? Do not believe me unless I do what
my Father does. Even though you do not believe me, believe the miracles that you may know
and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.
(Crowds attention shifts to the back where a father carries in a dead girl. The mother and
possibly siblings, following, weeping. Jesus takes the child in his arms. The choir starts quietly
singing “Lamb of God by Rebecca St. James. (or “Worthy is the Lamb”) Jesus prays over the
girl. Slowly he lifts her to heaven. Brings her back down and cradles her momentarily. The girl
stirs. The crowd is flabbergasted. Jesus gives the girl back to her parents. Choir finishes song
with volume and enthusiasm and praise. Priests 1 and 2 leave in disgust. Girls runs to Jesus to
hug him. He picks her up and stretches one hand to heaven. Everyone kneels to Jesus, raising
their hands. Black out. Curtain)
SALOME SCENE 8 (before the curtain)
MARTHA:
I knew Jesus was the Messiah and many others were coming to put their trust in him as well.
But we had missed part of his message – the nature of his kingdom. Many were looking for an
earthy king, an earthy kingdom and an earthy reward.
(Jesus enters from curtains to center. SALOME, JAMES and JOHN enter from stage right and
place themselves at Jesus feet. Other disciples enter stage left and stand left.)

JESUS
What is it you want?
SALOME: (Straightening up but still kneeling)
Grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your
kingdom.
JESUS
You don't know what you are asking. (To James and John) Can you drink the cup I am going to
drink?
JOHN:
We can.
JESUS
You will indeed drink from my cup, but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant. These
places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my Father. (Other disciples start
towards JESUS, upset and talking amongst themselves)
MARTHA:
When the ten heard about this, they were indignant.
JESUS
You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their high officials exercise
authority over them. Not so with you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must
be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave— just as the Son of Man did
not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.
Choir sings “Servant of All” and/or Song by disciples – Oh, Jesus I have promised, three verses.

(Curtain opens part way to reveal Jesus and his disciples. Peter will insert himself in scene.
Martha exits)
JESUS:
This sickness will not end in death. No, it is for God's glory so that God's Son may be glorified
through it. Let us go back to Judea.
JAMES:
But Rabbi, a short while ago the Jews tried to stone you, and yet you are going back there?
JESUS:
Are there not twelve hours of daylight? A man who walks by day will not stumble, for he sees by
this world's light. It is when he walks by night that he stumbles, for he has no light. Our friend
Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going there to wake him up.
PETER:
Lord, if he sleeps, he will get better
JESUS:
Lazarus is dead, and for your sake I am glad I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us
go to him.
THOMAS:
Let us also go, that we may die with him. (Jesus and disciples move to down right as the
curtains are opened all the way and the lights come up to reveal mourners at a tomb.)

Your brother will rise again.

I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
JESUS
I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; and
whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?

Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.

The Teacher is here, and is asking for you.

Where have you laid him?

Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God? Father, I thank you that
you have heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people
standing here, that they may believe that you sent me. (With power) Lazarus, come out!
(Lazarus emerges from the tomb. Martha and Mary rush to him to remove the grave clothes.
They embrace, bow to Jesus. Reprise of chorus of “These are the Days of Elijah”)
SALOME SCENE 11 (before the curtain)
SALOME:
Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the
dead continued to spread the word. Many people, because they had heard that he had given this
miraculous sign, went out of their way to hear and see him for themselves. (Choir sings “Agnus
Deus/Worthy” by Third Day “or “Hosanna, Loud Hosanna” (Crowd enters from the sides of
stage and back waving palm branches) By the time Passover came, people lined the streets with
their children, hoping to catch a glimpse of him. When he arrived they greeted him as king with
shouts of praise, singing and waving cut palm branches.
(Curtain opens to reveal choir and rest of crowd. Jesus enters from the back, trailed by his
disciples. The crowd calls out
"Hosanna!
"Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
"Blessed is the King of Israel! Jesus touches the people and when he is in place center
stage many children come to him for his blessing. Song ends with everyone kneeling or
paying Christ homage)
TEMPLE SCENE 12
(The crowds start to gather to hear him teach, slightly right of center. Three priests are set up,
left, collecting taxes. Some of the people stop to pay before they make their way over to Jesus.
Two with large sums make a big show of what large quantities they are giving. In the back of the
line is a poor widow, dressed in rags, moving humbly)
JUDAS
Look, Teacher! The temple! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!"
JESUS
Do you see all these great buildings? Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will
be thrown down. Destroy this temple and in three days I will rebuild it. (The crowd turns to
each other in confusion. Two members of the crowd go to the priests collecting money, point at

Jesus during the next segment)
Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest
with very little will also be dishonest with much. (Judas should shift about uncomfortably but the
rest should not notice. The priests are now noticing what Jesus is saying. They shake their heads
and two come over to join the group gathered around Jesus) So if you have not been trustworthy
in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches? And if you have not been
trustworthy with someone else's property, who will give you property of your own?
No servant can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be
devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.
PRIEST 1:
Who gives you the authority to teach these things to these people?
JESUS:
I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing
these things. John's baptism—where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?
(Priests put their heads together briefly)
PRIEST 2:
We don't know.
JESUS
Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
PRIEST 1:
Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
JESUS:
Show me the coin used for paying the tax. (They bring him a denarius. By this time the widow
should be next in line to deposit money.) Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?"
PRIEST 2:
Caesar's. (Widow needs to be at the front of the line by this time)
JESUS:
Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's. You see that widow? She has put in
two very small copper coins. I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put in more than all the
others. All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she out of her poverty put in all

she had to live on. (pointedly to priests) This temple should be a house of prayer for all nations
but you have made it a den of thieves.
PRIEST 1: (Moving to Jesus to confront him)
Who gives you the authority to teach these things to these people?
JESUS:
I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am doing

Curtain closes)
PRIESTS PLOT SCENE 13 (before the curtain)
NICODEMUS:
The priests were embarrassed, outwitted and angry but what could they do? The people were
convinced the Messiah had come. Discouraged, the priests reported to the High Priest, Caiaphas
and plotted in earnest against our savior. (Priests enter in front of the curtain)
NICODEMUS: (Trying in vain to convince Caiaphas)
Caiaphas, this Jesus performed miracles of healing and casting out demons! He raided the dead!
CAIAPHAS:
It was all staged. There was no demon. That other girl, (with distaste) that Gentile, wasn’t dead.
PRIEST: 2:
People swear the men were, had been, blind for years, Caiaphas.
PRIEST 1:
Caiaphas! The crowds are worse than ever, worse than at Bethany. Here is this man, this Jesus
of Nazareth teaching in the temple and the people latch on to his every word. Because they are
convinced he has performed many miraculous signs and that Jesus brought Lazarus back from
the dead!

CAIAPHAS: (Pacing, running his hand across his forehead)
See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!
NICODEMAS:
This man Jesus is performing many miraculous signs. The blind receive sight, the lame walk,
those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised. No one ever spoke the way
he does.
CAIAPHAS:
You mean he has deceived you also? "Have any of us believed in him? No! But this mob that
knows nothing of the law—there is a curse on them.
NICODEMAS
Does our law condemn anyone without first hearing him to find out what he is doing?
CAIAPHAS
(To Nicodemus) Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find that a prophet does
not come out of Galilee
PRIEST 1
If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will come and
take away both our place and our nation.
CAIAPHAS
(To Nicodemus) You know nothing at all! You do not realize that it is better for you that one
man die for the people than that the whole nation perish. (Priest 2 and Judas enter as Caiaphas
says to Priest 1) If he comes to the feast I want it reported to me immediately so we can arrest
him. But not during the Feast, or there may be a riot among the people.
PRIEST 2:
Caiaphas, this man, one of his disciples, is willing to help us.
JUDAS:
What are you willing to give me if I hand him over to you?
CAIAPHAS:
Thirty pieces of silver. (Judas nods, they count out the money to him, lights off)

(Curtain opens. Choir sings “Do this, Remember Me” by Keith Ilwain” During the song Jesus
blesses, then breaks bread and hands it to the disciples. He blesses, then passes the cup and his
disciples drink from it.)
(Jesus gets up from the meal, as he takes off his outer clothing, wraps a towel around his waist
and pour water into a basin the disciples clear the table and other Passover items off stage. The
disciples in small groups or singularly as their stage clearing tasks allow. Jesus begins to wash
his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.)
PETER: (During the foot washing)
Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under his power, and that he had come from God
and was returning to God. Jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go
to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent
of his love. He washed our feet. The lowest servant in a house was usually assigned that task.
Yet here was the Son of God, the Lord of the Universe washing our feet. (Peter inserts himself
into the scene)
PETER:
Lord, are you going to wash my feet?
JESUS:
You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.
PETER:
No, you shall never wash my feet.
JESUS:
Unless I wash you, you have no part with me. You call me 'Teacher' and 'Lord,' and rightly so,
for that is what I am. Now that I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also should
wash one another's feet. I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you. I
tell you the truth, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one
who sent him. Now that you know these things, you will be blessed if you do them.
(Possible to add “Make me a servant” if more time is needed for foot washing. Afterwards, one
of the disciples takes the basin and towel off stage. Jesus puts on his outer garments)
JESUS:
The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified. I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of
wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many
seeds. The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will

keep it for eternal life. Whoever serves me must follow me; and where I am, my servant also will
be. My Father will honor the one who serves me. (Curtain)
THE GARDEN SCENE 15 (before the curtain)
NICODEMUS:
Judas had walked with Jesus for three year. He knew Jesus would head for the Mount of Olives
because he often prayed there. Caiaphas called together a mob to follow Judas and arrest Jesus.
(As Nicodemus is speaking, choir is humming Ebon Pinion. Jesus and three disciples enter in
front of the curtain. Jesus has them stay center right while he crosses to center left. Disciples lie
down and fall asleep. Jesus kneels and begins praying)
PETER:
But never had he prayed as he did that night. He was sorrowful to the point of point of death.
All of us disciples fell asleep while he prayed the cup be taken from him, if it was possible.
Even with the knowledge of the horrors he would face in such a short time he said “Yet not as I
will, but as you will. (Peter lies down)
(Choir sings the second and third verse. Jesus prays and three times wakes the sleeping
disciples but they fall back asleep. During the last time the temple guards and Judas enter from
the back. Voices say “Find him, Judas” or “He’s got to be stopped” “Which one is he?”
Judas kisses Jesus and the guards arrest him. Disciples at first try to stop them, then they run.
Guards haul Jesus out the way they came in. Judas falls to his knees, remorseful)

TRIAL BEFORE PILATE SCENE 17
Curtain opens to Pilate’s Hall. . Crowd is muttering, angry, expectant. A few members of the
crowd filter in from the back. A trumpet sounds. Pilate comes out. Guards bring Jesus, bound,
in from stage right. Crowd mutters and points angrily.
SALOME:
By morning, our leaders had gained an audience with Pilate, the Roman governor. They had
turned the hearts of the people against Jesus. The same crowd that was ready to crown him king
a week early was calling for his execution. (Priests step forward to accuse Jesus.)
PILATE:
What charges are you bringing against this man?
CAIAPHAS:
We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the Son of God.
PRIEST 1:
He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has come all the
way here
PILATE:
Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.

CAIAPHAS:
But we have no right to execute anyone.
PRIEST 1:
If he were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you.
CAIAPHAS:
We have found this man subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to Caesar and
claims to be Christ a king (Crowd becomes more restless)
CAIAPHAS:
If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king opposes
Caesar
PILATE:
(To Jesus) Do you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?
JESUS:
You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above.
PILATE:
See how many things they are accusing you of. Aren't you going to answer? Are you the king of
the Jews?
JESUS:
You are right in saying I am a king. But my kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my servants
would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. My kingdom is from another place. In fact, for
this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone on the
side of truth listens to me.
PILATE:
What is truth? I find no basis for a charge against him. You brought me this man as one who
was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have found no
basis for your charges against him. Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as you can see,
he has done nothing to deserve death. (Motion to guards stage right. They bring our Barabbas, a
surly looking man) But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the
Passover. Do you want me to release Barabbas, murderer or Jesus, the one called Christ, the king
of the Jews'?

(Amos and children remove themselves from the scene and come in front of curtain)
PILATE: (Throws towel in disgust)
Take him away! Have him flogged and crucified. (Crowd cheers and exits. Barabbas is
untied. Jesus is tied to a post. Curtain closes partway so only the flogging post is visible.)
THE FLOGGING SCENE 18
The only lighting should be a spot on Jesus. This is not only to hide any activity while the
crosses are set but to focus the audience’s attention. During the song, “Blood on My Hands” by
Todd Agnew, the flogging will stop, guards will untie Jesus from the post, push a crown of
thorns on his head, give him his cross to carry . Jesus carries it out by going up the aisle and
out the back entrance. Jesus stumbles three times. Each time raising his eyes to God and clearly
portraying to the audience it is his love for us, not the soldiers that urges him on. After the third
time the soldiers will seize Simon of Cyrene to carry the cross the rest of the way. Curtain
closes.

Mourners enter from the back and kneel before the curtain. Choir sings “Were You There”
Audience can hear the sound of blows, nails being driven through Christ’s hands and feet and
his cries of pain. Curtain opens. Dim lighting with spots gives the feeling of the darkness that
came over the land. Jesus and the thieves will be upon their crosses. A written notice is nailed to
the cross that says THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. During the crucifixion scene the
following needs to be done in accordance with scriptures: Someone will offer Jesus a sponge to
drink from, soldiers will cast lots for his clothes, MARY, MARY MAGDELA, SALOME, MARY 2
will be crying with John comforting and supporting SALOME and MRAY, Jesus’ mother.
Song(s) Use one or more, depending on the timing of the dramatic action. “The Day He Wore
My Crown” “Were You There”, “Man of Sorrows”
While the chorus hums the following dialogue takes place. Jesus has obvious difficulty getting
enough breath to say the lines. There are pauses between them.
"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? (Towards heaven)
Dear woman, here is your son.

Here is your mother. (Toward his mother and John. They

It is finished. Father, into your hands I commit my spirit. (To heaven)
Jesus will bow his head and die. There will be a crack of lightning and thunder. Mourners will
leave hurriedly. Blackout and curtain closes. Another verse or song with a dark stage. SALOME
enters to center stage, spot light on her)
SALOME’S SORROW SCENE 20 (before curtain)
(Adapted from Mary’s Sorrow written by and used by permission of Linda Lineberry. The
audience should be able to relive the crucifixion scene from the women’s point of view)
SALOME:
In the darkness of noonday a few of us who loved him stood on that hill before His cross. My
son John, was the only one of the men who braved arrest and I could not keep the terror from

welling up in my heart….. that the soldiers would grab my son John. Forcefully stretch him out
on another cross. Drive nails through his hands and feet. And let him die too. Was this to be
the cup Jesus had asked if they could partake? I wondered as John held me and Mary.
At Jesus birth, a prophet named Simeon had warned Mary that a sword would pierce her heart.
In the darkness of noonday I stood on that hill next to her and watched her watch her firstborn,
her promised child, hanging bloodied and torn on a criminal’s cross.
His blood was running down from the crown of thorns cruelly pressed into his flesh. It poured
from wounds torn wide and gaping from the flogging. It was falling on Mary. He was dying and
we heard him cry out (in anguish) “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me.” (Looking up)
I looked up into his loving face and never in all my years had I ever seen such agony… and such
sorrow. I tried to comfort her. Her son was dying. (Catch in throat, struggle to go on) We
were watching him die. (Cover area below chin so sound is not blocked) I covered my mouth to
keep the horror inside.
As they laid him in the tomb Mary repeated the words that the angel Gabriel gave her so many
years ago. “He shall live forever and his kingdom will never end.” (with hope) El Shaddai, the
Holy God, keeps his promise. We held to that and each other. (Bow head. John comes on stage
to gently lead her off. )
Possible to add another song that was not used before to allow time for set change.
PETER: (spotlight)
Christ suffered for me and you. He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.
When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats.
Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly.
He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, so that we might die to sins and live for
righteousness; by his wounds have you and I been healed.
NICODEMUS: (spotlight)
Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus. Now Joseph had been a disciple of Jesus,
but secretly because he feared the Jews. Like me. A time of decision had come. He could no
longer walk in favor with both God and our leaders. He had choose. He chose Jesus.
I could no longer vacillate between two opinions. I had to choose. I chose Jesus. I brought a
mixture of myrrh, to anoint my king (starting to cry) and aloes, though those wounds wound
never be soothed by human hands.

(Crying out to God, grief stricken and in anguish) Why had I waited so long? Why had I waited
until he was dead? (Getting control over his emotions and in a flat tone) Passover was upon us
so we laid his body in the garden in a new tomb, in which no one had ever been laid.
MARTHA: (spotlight)
In the ultimate act of servant hood, Christ had died in my place, in your place. But death was a
beginning, not an end. The chief priests and elders posted their guard. (starting to sound
celebratory) But death had no power over him. I had seen my brother restored to life. We were
about to see just how much power Christ had. Nothing in all of creation could stop the Son of
God.
RESURRECTION SCENE 21
Curtain opens to the tomb. Guards posted on either side. Song “Low I the Grave He Lay” First
verse is slow, almost majestic. At the close of the first verse the guards fall, the stone rolls back
and Jesus appears as the chorus begins.
Jesus comes out of the tomb. MARY MAGDELA, SALOME and MARY 2 enter about 6 steps
before they stop, startled to see Jesus. SALOME and MARY 2 exit quickly. MARY MAGDELA
bows low to the ground. The other women return bringing first PETER and JOHN; then the nine
other disciples follow. They embrace and worship him, examine his hands, his side. All kneel
before him. The choir and crowd enter the scene and slowly move toward Jesus. Crowd
members kneel in awe.
MARTHA:
The news he had risen spread like wildfire through the city of Jerusalem and to Emmaus and
beyond. Over 400 people saw the risen savior during the next 40 days. He led us out to a place
near my home in Bethany, lifted up his hands and blessed us. (Kneels)
JESUS:
All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore Go into all the world and
preach the good news to all creation. Make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name
of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Teach them to obey everything I have
commanded you. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe
will be condemned. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age. (He ascends,
PETER moves in front of curtain. Curtain closes.)

INVITATION SCENE 22 (before the curtain)
PETER:
While he was blessing us, he was taken up into heaven. We worshiped him and returned to
Jerusalem with great joy. (Choir and crowd start filtering in before the curtain) Disciples went
into all the world preaching the good news making disciples in all nations, in all walks of life.
No matter what someone had been, no matter what someone had done, they found new life. I
had been a sheep going astray, but finally had returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of my
souls. Jesus, the good shepherd, is waiting to receive any who wish to come to him. Come to
him. Come now. Come forward as we sing.
Choir sings first verse of “Come just as you are@
SALOME:
Maybe this is the first time you have heard the story of Jesus, the servant king. Maybe you never
knew what he was willing to suffer for you. Maybe, like me, you have been looking for earthly
power and earthy answers. Lasting answers and lasting power come from heaven, come from
Jesus. He will save you, this very night. Come to him. Come now. Come as we sing.
NICODEMUS:
Don=t you wait too long. Now is your day of decision. If you have never accepted Jesus as your
Lord and Savior do so tonight. There are people here waiting to receive you, help you and pray
with you. Don=t let what other people might think stop you from coming to the one who loved
you enough to die for you. Come to him. Come now. Come as we sing.
(Sing second verse of “Come just as you are”)
MARTHA:
Perhaps you believe and have declared him to be the Christ, the son of God who has come into
the world. But maybe your love has grown dim or cold or died out altogether. Jesus has the
power to bring the dead back to life. Let that power wash over you tonight. Come to him.
Come now. Come as we sing.
PETER:
Maybe you once followed him but you fell away. If he could restore me, if he could welcome
me, a man who denied him, he can restore you. He not only can, he will. There is more
rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over 99 who do not need to. Come to him
to be restored. Come while we sing.

CHRIST THE KING! SCENE 23
(Curtain opens and Jesus is center stage on a throne, robed as a king, wearing a crown with the
angels around him, kneeling, raising their hands to pay him homage. Lights should be bright
with as much radiance and dazzling glow as possible.)
Choir B A”Crown Him Lord of All” The following all enter from the back, kneel before Jesus,
present their gift and move to the side, alternating left and right. A person from Jesus day
alternates with one from modern day.
The Magi enter from the back and lay their crowns before Jesus. A doctor or nurse, laying down
a surgical cap. The centurion comes, laying his sword down. A soldier, laying down his gun. A
shepherd, laying down his staff, a businessman lays down his briefcase. Nicodemus, laying
down his priestly stole, football player (or other sportsman) lays down his helmet and trophy, the
demon possessed girl and her mother lay down a basket with fruit, a motorcycle gang member,
his helmet, a graduate lays down her cap. After laying down their item, they join the crowd.
Jesus stands and opens his arms to the audience. Choir and all sing Hosanna!

Days of Elijah by Robin Mark

These are the days of Elijah
Declaring the Word of the Lord
And these are the days of your servant Moses
Righteousness being restored

Behold He comes! Riding on the clouds!
Shining like the sun! At the trumpet call
Lift your voice! It's the year of Jubilee!
And out of Zion's hill salvation comes!

And though these are days of great trials
Of famine and darkness and sword

There's no God like Jehovah!

Still we are the voice in the desert crying
Prepare ye the way of the Lord!

There's no God like Jehovah!

Behold He comes! Riding on the clouds!
Shining like the sun! At the trumpet call
Lift your voice! It's the year of Jubilee!
And out of Zion's hill salvation comes!
And these are the days of Ezekiel
The dry bones becoming as flesh
And these are the days of your servant David
Rebuilding a temple of praise
And these are the days of the harvest
The fields are as white in the world
And we are the labourers in your vineyard
Declaring the word of the Lord!
Agnus Dei

There's no God like Jehovah!
There's no God like Jehovah!
(Repeat 3 times)
Behold He comes! Riding on the clouds!
Shining like the sun! At the trumpet call
Lift your voice! It's the year of Jubilee!
And out of Zion's hill salvation comes!
Behold He comes! Riding on the clouds!
Shining like the sun! At the trumpet call
Lift your voice! It's the year of Jubilee!
And out of Zion's hill salvation comes!
And out of Zion's hill salvation comes!
And out of Zion's hill salvation comes!

A Cold Heart Turns by Rebecca St James
Power thunder, lightning bolts
Rushing wind, a waterfall
Babies' cry, a mother's tears
Humming river, rustling leaves

Winter snow, a fire's warmth
Summer's day a cold heart turns
Peaceful place, a helping hand
Kindly words, a smiling face

CHORUS:
He's calling loud and clearly
He's saying "Won't you hear Me"
We see Him everywhere
And still we roll on by

CHORUS
He was God but one of us
A king who had a servants heart
Born to die so we might live
His reason was His Father's will
Rushing wind, a waterfall
Winter snow, a fire's warmth
Summer's day a cold heart turns

CHORUS
Power thunder, lightning bolts
Blood on my Hands by Todd Agnew
Each crack of that whip was for my mistakes
Blood is on my hands
Each stumble up that hill was my step to take
Blood is on my hands
How do I say thanks for this
In the cross, In the cross, be my glory ever
Till my ransomed soul shall find rest beyond the
river

Make Christ Your King Today

Each tear that flowed was by my sorrow sown
Blood is on my hands
Each drop that was spilled, my debt fulfilled
His blood is on my hands
How can I say thanks for this
Jesus keep me near the cross
There a precious fountain
Free to all, a healing stream flows
from Calvary's mountain

O youth, with life before you, and with gladness
all around,
While in your heart the songs of hope and
courage ring,
“Remember thy Creator while the evil days
come not,”
And choose the Christ of Calvary to be your
King.

True wisdom you are seeking; no one ever
sought in vain
Who asked of Him who lived and taught in
Galilee;
A fullness and a brightness for your life in Him
you’ll find,
And safety from the sins that lie in wait for thee.

Refrain

Courageous be, and loyal, for on every hand are
foes
That wait with subtle charms to lead your feet
astray,
Yet Christ the world’s Redeemer every step
before you knows,
And He will guide, and guard, and love you all
the way.

Choose today! acknowledge Him your Savior;
Choose today! your heart a tribute bring
Unto Him who suffered to redeem you,
Let Him rule and reign, your King!
Choose today, for love and valiant service
Unto Him belong,
Take the vow, and ever faithful be
Till you sing the victor’s song.

Servant of all

Refrain

Refrain



If you want to be great in God's kingdom
Learn to be the servant of all (repeat)
Learn to be the servant of all
learn to be the servant of all.
If you want to be great in God's kingdom
Learn to be the servant of all.

I Will Serve Thee
I will serve Thee because I love Thee
You have given life to me
I was nothing before You found me
You have given life to me
Heartaches, broken pieces
Ruined lives are why You died on Calvary
Your touch was what I longed for
You have given life to me

Oh, Jesus I have promised 
O Jesus, I have promised to serve Thee to the
end;
Be Thou forever near me, my Master and my
Friend;
I shall not fear the battle if Thou art by my side,
Nor wander from the pathway if Thou wilt be
my Guide.
O let me feel Thee near me! The world is ever
near;
I see the sights that dazzle, the tempting sounds I
hear;

My foes are ever near me, around me and
within;
But Jesus, draw Thou nearer, and shield my soul
from sin.
O Jesus, Thou hast promised to all who follow
Thee
That where Thou art in glory there shall Thy
servant be.
And Jesus, I have promised to serve Thee to the
end;
O give me grace to follow, my Master and my
Friend.

Do This, Remember Me by Keith Ilwain

He took the cup of blessing, the blood of Jesus
And Jesus thought of the morrow, His work here
shed
nearly done.
That all might know forgiveness, received when
With one last night together, they knew not what
Jesus bled.
would be,
Salvation now available to all on bended knee
But Jesus had one final word:
Who repent and follow His command:
“Do This; Remember Me!”
“Do This; Remember Me!”
Thanksgiving to the Father, an ancient feast
made new.
Christ said, “This is My body, My body giv’n
for you.”
The holy bread was broken and shared with
Jesus’ plea
That His words not be forgotten:
“Do This; Remember Me!”

Yes, Christ’s command continues to all who
serve His Name
To go and make disciples, that all would sing
His fame.
And gathered at one table His holy church shall
see
Our Master is still calling:
“Do This; Remember Me!”

The Day He Wore my Crown
The darkest hour in history
I can’t believe my eyes
Before me hangs the Lamb of God
And I watch as all of creation cries

And I’m the one to blame
I caused all the pain
He gave Himself
The day He wore my crown

CHORUS

He brought me love
That only He could give

I brought Him cause to cry
And though He taught me how to live
I only sat and watched Him die
He could’ve called His Holy Father
And said “Take Me away,
Please take Me away!”
He could’ve said: “O I’m not guilty

And I’m not gonna stay
I’m not gonna pay”
But He walked right through the gate
Then on up the hill
And as He fell beneath the way
He cried, He cried:‘Father not my will’

When I survey the Wondrous Cross 
When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of Glory died
My richest gain I count but loss
And pour contempt on all my pride
See from his head, his hands, his feet
Sorrow and love flow mingled down
Did ever such love and sorrow meet
Or thorns compose so rich a crown

O the wonderful cross, O the wonderful cross
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly
live
O the wonderful cross, O the wonderful cross
All who gather here by grace draw near and
bless
Your name
Were the whole realm of nature mine
That were an offering far too small
Love so amazing, so divine
Demands my soul, my life, my all

SCENE 1 (before the curtain)

Before the curtain Amos is tending to a lamb (If a prop lamb is used it should be wrapped in a
blanket to help hide the fact) Children come running on stage ad libbing Amos! You found our
lamb! Our lamb is found!
AMOS: Yes. This little one had wandered from the flock. He could have been lost forever or
found by wolves. (Hands lamb to child) I have fixed his foot but best you carry him home and
for the next two days to allow him to heal. (Child leaves immediately if lamb is a prop.
Otherwise stays on stage as long as lamb is still)
RACHEL: Tell us the story of the Lamb of God, Amos. Tell us about how you were there when
he was born.
(Shepherds enter in front of the curtain. They lay down)
AMOS: When I was your age, I was already a shepherd. One night we were out in the fields
watching our flocks. I was taking my watch when …
BETHLEHEM SCENE 2
(Curtains open with Gabriel center stage backed by the choir in angel robes standing
powerfully. The choir sings. – “Joy to the World” verse one and two. Choir hums during
spoken dialogue.
Other songs to consider for this scene: “Angels from the Realms of Glory”, “The Flocks were
wrapped in Slumber”,” In the fields their Flocks Abiding”, “Rise Up Shepherd and Follow”,
“While Shepherds Watched their Flocks”, “While their Flocks the Shepherds Tended.”
Shepherds notice Gabriel and are frightened, the younger ones scurrying into the protective
embrace of an older shepherd. Amos and children insert themselves into the scene.
GABRIEL: Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.
Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ, the Lord. This will be a
sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.
ANGEL VOICE 1: (from the choir): Glory to God in the highest!
ANGEL VOICE 2: (From the choir) And on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests

Choir sings “Hark, the Herald Angels Sing, verse one” while the shepherds look to each other in
wonderment and listen to the choir of angels
AMOS: Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us
about. (Shepherds exit left. Angel Choir sings “Rise Up, Shepherd and Follow”, then the
second and third verses of “Hark, the Herald Angels Sing” while the following occurs without
dialogue. Lights on the choir are dim to focus attention on MARY, JOSEPH, etc)
(Mary, Joseph and baby enter stage right during the song. Mary lays Jesus in a manger and
Joseph and Mary bow to pray, then raise their heads and hands to God. Shepherds enter, bow
and exit. Magi enter from the back and bow before the family)
AMOS: We told everyone of this glorious news! The prophet Micah had told us that
Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, was by no means least among the rulers of Judah; He said “for
out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel. The Messiah was
born. The Great Shepherd had arrived. Israel would be redeemed. We returned to the flocks
and told the ones who had stayed behind. But this news was not confined to just us Jews.
MAGI 1: Here is the one who has been born king of the Jews. We saw his star in the east and
have come to worship him.
MAGI 2: It has been said that in the land of Judah,
one will come who is a ruler
one who will be the shepherd of the people of Israel
(Song “Hail, Thou Source of Every Blessing”, “by Magi, (Can be backed by the choir. Magi
can have servants who lend their voices as well) Curtain closes. Choir changes into Biblical
costumes. AMOS, RACHEL and other child(ren) in front of curtain)
SCENE 3 (before the curtain)
AMOS: The good news spread as far as the palace of King Herod. He did not rejoice at the news
of a rival king. He sent out soldiers to destroy any threats to his throne. But God shepherded the
family away to Egypt. For thirty years we heard nothing. Then we heard about a man preaching
in the desert, a powerful man. One day we brought our flocks to the River Jordan, hoping we
might see for ourselves. There he was – John – baptizing people for the remission of their sins.
BAPTISM SCENE 4
(Curtain opens. Rocks in the forefront conceal the area where baptism will take place and water
can be hidden to wet those being baptized. Choir starts “There’s a voice in the Wilderness
Crying”. John will baptize two people, Amos and children will merge with crowd)
PRIEST 1: Who you are? Are you the Christ?

JOHN: I am not the Crist
PRIEST 2: Then who are you? Are you Elijah?
JOHN: I am not.
NICODEMAS: Are you the Prophet?"
JOHN: No.
PRIEST 1: Who are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say
about yourself?
JOHN: I am the voice of one calling in the desert, 'Make straight the way for the Lord.
NICODEMAS: Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?
JOHN: I am the voice of one calling in the desert, 'Make straight the way for the Lord. He stands
among you, one more powerful than I.
PRIEST 1: Who is this one who is coming?
JOHN: The promised Messiah, he the prophets of old proclaimed. (Jesus begins moving to the
front of the crowd. John suddenly whirls and points directly at him) Look, the Lamb of God,
who takes away the sin of the world! (Crowd parts and Jesus steps forward.) This is the one I
meant when I said, 'A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.'
JESUS: (to John) I have come to be baptized.
JOHN B: I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me? (Bowing) I am not worthy to tie
your sandal.
JESUS: Let it be so now; (Jesus takes him by the shoulders and raises him up) it is proper for us
to do this to fulfill all righteousness. (JOHN B baptizes Jesus)
JOHN: Look, this is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! I have seen and I
testify that this is the Son of God.
VOICE of GOD: This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. (Dove comes down)
JOHN: Behold the Lamb of God. He must become greater; I must become less.
AMOS: From that day on many chose to follow Jesus.

(Jesus beckons and several follow him. Amos and children come downstage. Curtain closes
behind them. Disciples singing “Like a Lamb Who Needs a Shepherd” enter stage left, spot on
them as they sing. They exit)
SCENE 5 (before the curtain)
AMOS: John had called him the Lamb of God. That was confusing. We were expecting the
Messiah to be a king like David, the lion of Judah! Not a lamb. We were looking for one who
would restore the kingdom to Israel and rid us of Roman rule, a son of David, a conquering hero.
RACHEL:
David, he’s the one who saved the lambs from the lion and the bear!
AMOS: Yes. We had forgotten, even me, a shepherd. David was a shepherd before he was a
king and the prophet Isaiah had said “Out of Judah would come a ruler who will be the
Shepherd of Israel. A shepherd cares for his flock first and tends to his own needs second.
David had been that kind of king. And like David, Jesus had compassion for the weak, the
young, the sick, the outcast. When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because they
were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. (Choir and crowd start to trickle on
stage; they are looking expectantly at each other, and looking as if they expect someone. Then
from the back, Jesus with a few disciples appears. People’s faces light up, they point and their
faces reflect the excitement of seeing him. A few children run to him and he bends down to scoop
one up for a hug, then returning them to the ground. Two children take Jesus’ hands and walk
by his side as he continues to walk, stopping to touch people, touch a child being held out to him
as he moves toward the stage. Curtain opens to reveal the rest of the choir and crowd. Blind
men are far stage left, softly calling once for Jesus to have mercy on them. Crowd will shush
them)
JESUS THE GOOD SHEPHERD SCENE 6
AMOS: He went through all the towns and villages, teaching in our synagogues, preaching the
good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. Word of his teaching and
miracles spread like wildfire. Even the Romans occupying our country heard of him and his
power.
He even called himself the good shepherd. He said his sheep would know his voice. I remember
the day two blind men heard his voice and knew him. Knew him as the son of David, the
shepherd king. (Amos and children merge into the scene)
JESUS: (Center stage, children are closest to him, sitting at his feet. A few adults sit as well)
Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Does he not leave the ninetynine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it? (Scoops up a very small
child in illustration and puts her on his shoulder, the blind men are inching their way by touch

toward his voice,) And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home. Then
he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found my lost
sheep.' (Hands child back to parent) I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing
in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need
to repent.
BLIND MAN 1: Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
CROWD: Quiet. Be quiet.
BLIND MAN 1 & 2: (Louder) Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!
JESUS: (Indicating two of his disciples should lead them to him) What do you want me to do for
you?
BLIND MAN 2: Lord, we want our sight. (Jesus touches their eyes, they receive their sight and
thank him; the crowd is amazed)
JESUS: The man who enters by the gate is the shepherd of his sheep and the sheep listen to his
voice. The shepherd calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has brought out
all his own, he goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.
But they will never follow a stranger; in fact, they will run away from him because they do not
recognize a stranger's voice.
Centurion comes down center aisle. The crowd looks at him with loathing as he kneels before
Jesus. Jesus focuses on him. The crowd grows silent - a Roman kneeling to a Jew?! The
centurion lifts his head and speaks)
CENTURION: Lord, my servant lies at home paralyzed and in terrible suffering.
JESUS: I will go and heal him.
CENTURION: Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word,
and my servant will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I
tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one, 'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,'
and he does it."
JESUS: I tell you the truth; I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. Go! It will be
done just as you believed it would. (Centurion bows his head in reverence and exits center. The
crowd has mixed emotions. Most are either perplexed or unhappy Jesus that has helped a
Roman enemy)

JESUS: I am the gate for the sheep. I am the gate; whoever enters through me will be saved. He
will come in and go out, and find pasture. I have come that they may have life, and have it to the
full.
I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. The hired hand is
not the shepherd who owns the sheep. So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep
and runs away. Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it. The man runs away because he is
a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.
(There is a commotion stage right. The stage right crowd parts to reveal a woman and her
daughter who is shuddering and foaming from demon possession. The girl falls and shudders
once more, then lies as if she is dead. The woman, kneeling by the girl, cradling her as the
seizure subsides, calls out desperately. The crowd reacts with fear and avulsion to this gentile
and the demon. They pull back, holding children in protective embraces.)
CANAANITE WOMAN: Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is suffering
terribly from demon possession. (Someone in the crowd comes forward and kneels by the girl,
gently wiping her mouth and tending her as the mother goes to Jesus)
JESUS: (Compassionately) I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.
CANAANITE WOMAN :( Comes and kneels before him, face down. Sobs rack her body. She
lifts her tear streaked face and one had, imploring him) Lord, help me!
JESUS: (Kneels down to her, gently and expectantly)
It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to their dogs.
CANAANITE WOMAN: Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their
masters' table
JESUS: (Pulls her to her feet, with evident joy at her response)
Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted. (He indicates the girl with a wave of his
hand. The girl sits up, smiling and unpossessed. The crowd gasps. Mother and child rush into
each other’s arms and embrace)
CENTURION: (Coming from stage left moving right next to Jesus, kneeling)
Lord Jesus! My servant has been healed. At the very moment you spoke of it! (Crowd looks
amazed)
JESUS: I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me— and I lay down my
life for the sheep. I have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen. I must bring them also. They

too will listen to my voice, and there shall be one flock and one shepherd. (Crowds faces start to
register that maybe he is talking about Gentiles such as the Canaanite woman’s daughter and
the Centurion’s servant. Priests push to the forefront and center stage for a confrontation.)
PRIEST 1: (To the crowd and Nicodemus) He is demon-possessed and raving mad. Why listen to
him?
NICODEMUS: These are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon. Can a demon open the
eyes of the blind?
PRIEST 2: (To Jesus) How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us
plainly.
JESUS: I did tell you, but you do not believe. The miracles I do in my Father's name speak for
me, but you do not believe because you are not my sheep. My sheep listen to my voice; I know
them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch
them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can
snatch them out of my Father's hand. I and the Father are one.
PRIEST 1: Blasphemy! You, a mere man, claim to be God.
JESUS:I am the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world Why then
do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, 'I am God's Son'? Do not believe me unless I do
what my Father does. But if I do it, even though you do not believe me, believe the miracles that
you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.
(Crowds attention shifts to the back where a father carries in a dead girl. The mother and
possibly siblings, following, weeping. Jesus takes the child in his arms. The choir starts quietly
singing “Lamb of God by Rebecca St. James. (or “Worthy is the Lamb”) Jesus prays over the
girl. Slowly he lifts her to heaven. Brings her back down and cradles her momentarily. The girl
stirs. The crowd is flabbergasted. Jesus gives the girl back to her parents. Choir finishes song
with volume and enthusiasm and praise. Priests 1 and 2 leave in disgust. Girl runs to Jesus to
hug him. He picks her up and stretches one hand to heaven. Everyone kneels to Jesus, raising
their hands. Black out. Crowd moves off and Amos and children take center stage in a spot
light. Priests are down left)
SCENE 7 (before the curtain)
NICODEMUS: Caiaphas, this Jesus performed miracles of healing and casting out demons! He
raised the dead!
CAIAPHAS: It was all staged. There was no demon. That other girl wasn’t dead.
PRIEST: 1: People swear the men were, had been, blind for years, Caiaphas. (Spot out)

AMOS: Though John never performed a miraculous sign, all that John said about this man was
true. (Spot up on priests who are before the curtain, stage left) But it wasn’t until Bethany, that
whole towns were convinced.
RACHEL: What happened in Bethany?
AMOS: Something that the priests could not dismiss or silence. Bethany was home to Jesus
close friends, Lazarus and his sisters MARTHA: and Mary. Lazarus became gravely ill and the
sisters had sent for Jesus. But he did not come right away, and Lazarus died. He was wrapped in
strips of cloth and laid in a tomb. Many had come to mourn with MARTHA: and her sister
Mary. Some of priests had come, I think, to see if Jesus would and to use this as an opportunity
to discredit him.
RAISING OF LAZARUS SCENE 8
Curtain opens. Tomb with a crowd of mourners. Jesus and disciples enter. MARTHA: runs out
to Jesus and embraces him, sobbing. Amos, children and Priests merge into the scene.
MARTHA: If you had been here, my brother would not have died. But I know that even now
God will give you whatever you ask.
JESUS: Your brother will rise again.
MARTHA: I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
JESUS: I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies;
and whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?
MARTHA: Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into
the world.
JESUS: Get Mary. MARTHA leaves to get Mary, Priests to the crowd, away from Jesus.
Priest 1Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?
MARTHA: (Calling off stage right) The Teacher is here, and is asking for you.
MARY: (Enters to Jesus, falling at his feet weeping. Jesus gently raises her up to console her)
Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
JESUS: Where have you laid him?
MARTHA: Come and see, Lord.

JESUS: Take away the stone. (Some of the crowd do so)
MARTHA: But, Lord, by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been there four days.
JESUS: Did I not tell you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God? Father, I thank
you that you have heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the
people standing here, that they may believe that you sent me. Lazarus, come out!
(Lazarus emerges from the tomb. Reprise of Lamb of God. At end Amos and children move
down center so curtain can close behind them. )
SCENE 9 (before the curtain)
AMOS:
Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the
dead continued to spread the word. Many people, because they had heard that he had given this
miraculous sign, went out of their way to hear and see him for themselves. (Crowd enters from
the back waving palm branches) By the time Passover came, people lined the streets with their
children, hoping to catch a glimpse of him. When he arrived they greeted him as king with
shouts of praise, singing and waving cut palm branches.
(Jesus enters, trailed by his disciples. Song “Blessed is He” or “Hosanna, Loud Hosanna” The
crowd calls out
"Hosanna!
"Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!
"Blessed is the King of Israel! Jesus touches the people and when he is in place center
stage many children come to him for his blessing.)
TEMPLE SCENE 10
(The crowds start to gather to hear him teach. Curtain opens to the temple. Three priests are set
up, collecting taxes. Some of the people stop to pay before they make their way over to Jesus.
Two with large sums make a big show of what large quantities they are giving. In the back of the
line is a poor woman, dressed in rags, moving humbly)
JUDAS: Look, Teacher! The temple! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!"
JESUS: Do you see all these great buildings? Not one stone here will be left on another; every
one will be thrown down. Destroy this temple and in three days I will rebuild it. (The crowd

turns to each other in confusion. Two members of the crowd go to the priests collecting money,
point at Jesus during the next segment)
Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest
with very little will also be dishonest with much. (Judas should shift about uncomfortably but the
rest should not notice. The priests are now noticing what Jesus is saying. They shake their heads
and two come over to join the group gathered around Jesus) So if you have not been trustworthy
in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches? And if you have not been
trustworthy with someone else's property, who will give you property of your own?
No servant can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be
devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money.
PRIEST 1
Who gives you the authority to teach these things to these people?
JESUS: I will also ask you one question. If you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I am
doing these things. John's baptism—where did it come from? Was it from heaven, or from men?"
(Priests put their heads together briefly)
PRIEST 1: We don't know.
JESUS: Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
PRIEST 1 Tell us then, what is your opinion? Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
JESUS: Show me the coin used for paying the tax. (They bring him a denarius)
is this? And whose inscription?

Whose portrait

PRIEST 1Caesar's (Widow needs to be at the front of the line by this time)
JESUS: Give to Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's. You see that widow? She
has put in two very small copper coins. I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put in more than
all the others. All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she out of her poverty put
in all she had to live on.
This temple should be a house of prayer for all nations but you have made it a den of thieves.
(Priests walk away angry. Curtain closes)
SCENE 11 PRIESTS PLOT (before the curtain)
AMOS: The priests were embarrassed, outwitted and angry but what could they do? The people
were convinced the Messiah had come. He claimed to be the gate for the sheep – the barrier

between them and all that might harm them. He claimed to be the good shepherd, and indeed he
cared for them as none of their leaders did.
Discouraged, the priests reported to the High Priest, Caiaphas and plotted in earnest against the
Lamb of God. (Priests enter in front of the curtain)
PRIEST 1: Caiaphas! The crowds are worse than ever, worse than at Bethany. Here is this man,
this Jesus of Nazareth teaching in the temple and the people latch on to his every word. Because
they are convinced he has performed many miraculous signs and that Jesus brought Lazarus back
from the dead!
CAIAPHAS: See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!
NICODEMAS: This man Jesus is performing many miraculous signs. The blind receive sight,
the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised. No one ever
spoke the way he does.
CAIAPHAS: You mean he has deceived you also? "Have any of us believed in him? No! But
this mob that knows nothing of the law—there is a curse on them."
NICODEMAS: Does our law condemn anyone without first hearing him to find out what he is
doing?
CAIAPHAS: (To Nicodemus) Are you from Galilee, too? Look into it, and you will find that a
prophet does not come out of Galilee
PRIEST 2If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and then the Romans will
come and take away both our place and our nation.
CAIAPHAS: (To Nicodemas) You know nothing at all! You do not realize that it is better for
you that one man dies for the people than that the whole nation perish. (Priest 2 and Judas
enter as Caiaphas says to Priest 1) If he comes to the feast I want it reported to me immediately
so we can arrest him. But not during the Feast, or there may be a riot among the people.
PRIEST 2: Caiaphas, this man, one of his disciples, is willing to help us.
JUDAS: What are you willing to give me if I hand him over to you?
CAIAPHAS: Thirty pieces of silver. (Judas nods, they count out the money to him, lights off and
spot on Amos and the children)
AMOS: We began final preparations for the Passover. For hundreds of years we Jews had
celebrated the Passover on an annual basis, remembering, thanking God for his salvation,
teaching our children to be awed by the mighty power of El Shaddai.

Yet the words of Jesus, I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me— kept
ringing in my ears. As my hands ran over our lamb one final time I heard him saying: I lay
down my life for the sheep. The reason my Father loves me is that I lay down my life—only to
take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord.
LAST SUPPER SCENE 12
(Curtain opens. Song Beautiful Lamb of God. During the song Jesus blesses, then breaks bread
and hands it to the disciples. He blesses, then passes the cup.) Jesus and his disciples celebrated
the Passover. But Jesus was troubled. (Judas gets bread from Jesus and exits) He knew what
was to come, the ultimate sacrifice.
JESUS: This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: I will strike
the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered. A time is coming, and has come, when
you will be scattered, each to his own home. You will leave me all alone. Yet I am not alone, for
my Father is with me. (Curtain. First verse of Night with Ebon Pinion.)
GARDEN SCENE 13 (before the curtain)
AMOS: (As Amos is speaking, choir is humming Ebon Pinion. Jesus and three disciples enter in
front of the curtain. . Jesus has them stay center right while he crosses to center left. Disciples
lie down and fall asleep. Jesus kneels and begins praying)
Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him. He was sorrowful
to the point of point of death. All the disciples fell asleep while he prayed the cup be taken from
him, if it was possible. Even with the knowledge of the horrors he would face in such a short
time he said “Yet not as I will, but as you will.
(Choir sings the second and third verse. Jesus prays and three times wakes the sleeping
disciples but they fall back asleep. During the last time the temple guards and Judas enter from
the back. Voices say “take him to us Judas” or “He’s got to be stopped” “Where is he?”
Judas kisses Jesus and the guards arrest him. Disciples at first try to stop them, then they run.
Guards haul Jesus out the way they came in. Judas falls to his knees, remorseful)
Song Shepherd by Todd Agnew (before the curtain)
PILATE’S TRIAL SCENE 14
Curtain opens to Pilate’s Hall. Crowd is muttering, angry, expectant. A few members of the
crowd filter in from the back. Pilate comes out. Guards bring Jesus, bound in from stage right.
Crowd mutters and points angrily. Priests step forward to accuse Jesus.
AMOS: The same crowd that was ready to crown him king was calling for his execution. (Amos
and children merge into the scene)

PILATE: What charges are you bringing against this man?
CAIAPHAS: We have a law, and according to that law he must die, because he claimed to be the
Son of God.
PILATE: Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.
PRIEST 1: But we have no right to execute anyone.
PRIEST 2: If he were not a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you.
CAIAPHAS: We have found this man subverting our nation. He opposes payment of taxes to
Caesar and claims to be Christ a king
PRIEST 1: He stirs up the people all over Judea by his teaching. He started in Galilee and has
come all the way here
CAIAPHAS: If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who claims to be a king
opposes Caesar
PILATE: (To Jesus) Do you realize I have power either to free you or to crucify you?
JESUS: You would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above.
PILATE: See how many things they are accusing you of. Aren't you going to answer? Are you
the king of the Jews?
JESUS: You are right in saying I am a king. But my kingdom is not of this world. If it were, my
servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jews. My kingdom is from another place. In
fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.
Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.
PILATE: What is truth? I find no basis for a charge against him. You brought me this man as
one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined him in your presence and have
found no basis for your charges against him. Neither has Herod, for he sent him back to us; as
you can see, he has done nothing to deserve death. (Motions to guards stage right. They bring
our Barabbas, a surly looking man)
But it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the Passover. Do you
want me to release Barabbas or Jesus, the one called Christ, the king of the Jews'?
CROWD: No, not him! Give us Barabbas! Away with this man! Release Barabbas
PILATE: Shall I crucify your king?

CROWD VOICE 1: We have no king but Caesar!
CROWD: Crucify him!
PILATE: Why? What crime has this man committed?
CROWD: Crucify! Crucify! Barabbas! Give us Barabbas! Take him away! Take him away!
Crucify him!
PILATE: I am innocent of this man's blood. It is your responsibility!
CROWD VOICE 2: Let his blood be on us and on our children!
(Amos and children remove themselves from the scene and come in front of curtain)
PILATE: Take him away! Have him flogged and crucified. (Barabbas is untied. Crowd cheers
as curtain closes)
SCENE 15 (Before the curtain)
AMOS: The words of Isaiah flooded into my soul.
We all, like sheep, have gone astray,
each of us has turned to his own way;
and the LORD has laid on him
the iniquity of us all.
He was oppressed and afflicted,
yet he did not open his mouth;
he was led like a lamb to the slaughter,
and as a sheep before her shearers is silent,
so he did not open his mouth.
By oppression and judgment he was taken away.
And who can speak of his descendants?
For he was cut off from the land of the living;
for the transgression of my people he was stricken.
THE FLOGGING SCENE 16
(During his recitation, the blows of a whip will be heard. Curtain will open part way to reveal
Jesus, tied to a post, being flogged. The only lighting should be a spot on Jesus. This is not only
to hide any activity while the crosses are set but to focus the audience’s attention.

The children will look in horror, then starting with the youngest will turn away and bury their
faces against Amos. During the song, Jesus will be given his cross to carry and will prodded by
the guards, carry it out by going up the aisle and out. Jesus stumbles three times. Each time
raising his eyes to God and clearly portraying to the audience it is his love for us, not the
soldiers, which urges him on. After the third time the soldiers will seize Simon of Cyrene to
carry the cross the rest of the way. Curtain closes.
SCENE 17 (before the curtain)
AMOS: His words came echoing back.
I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep and my sheep know me— just as the Father knows
me and I know the Father—and I lay down my life for the sheep. The reason my Father
loves me is that I lay down my life—only to take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I
lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up
again.
CRUCIFIXION SCENE 18
Mourners enter from the back and kneel before the curtain. Curtain opens. Dim lighting with
spots gives the feeling of the darkness that came over the land. Jesus and the thieves will be
upon their crosses. A written notice is nailed to the cross that says THIS IS THE KING OF THE
JEWS. During the crucifixion scene the following needs to be done in accordance with
scriptures: Someone will offer Jesus a sponge to drink from, soldiers will cast lots for his
clothes, MARY, MARY MAGDELA, SALOME, MARY 2 will be crying with John comforting
Jesus’ mother.
Song(s) “Lamb of God” or “Beautiful Lamb”, “Worthy the Lamb”, “Glory of the Lamb”,
“Lamb of God, Whose Dying Love.”
While the chorus hums the following dialogue takes place. Jesus has obvious difficulty getting
enough breath to say the lines. There are pauses between them.
"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? (Towards heaven)

Jesus will bow his head and die. There will be a crack of lightning and thunder. Mourners will
leave hurriedly. Blackout and curtain closes. Another verse or song. Mary enters to center
stage, spot light on her)
MARY’S SORROW SCENE 19 (before curtain)
Mary’s Sorrow (Written by and used by permission of Linda Lineberry. The audience should be
able to relive the crucifixion scene from Mary’s point of view as she relives it in words)
In the darkness of noonday I stood on that hill and looked at my firstborn, my promised child,
hanging bloodied and torn on a criminal’s cross. (pantomimes) I wrapped my arms around the
base of his cross. It was as close as I could get to him. (Looks up) His blood was falling on me.
He was dying and I heard him cry out (in anguish) “My God, my God, why have you forsaken
me.” (Looking up) I looked up into his loving face and never in all my years of watching and
caressing and loving that beautiful face had I ever seen such agony… and such sorrow. I tried to
comfort him. He was dying. (Catch in throat, struggle to go on) I was watching him die.
(Cover area below chin so sound is not blocked) I covered my mouth to keep the horror inside.
As they laid him in the tomb the only comfort came from knowing I could trust the words that
the angel Gabriel gave me so many years ago. “He shall live forever and his kingdom will never
end.” (with hope) El Shaddai, the Holy God, keeps his promise. I held to that. (Bow head.
John comes on stage to gently lead her off. Spot switch to Amos)
AMOS: Christ, the Passover lamb for the entire world, had been sacrificed. He had been
sacrificed for me. He had been sacrificed for you.
When they hurled their insults at him, he did not retaliate; when he suffered, he made no threats.
Instead, he entrusted himself to him who judges justly. He himself bore our sins in his body on
the tree. .The chief priests and elders posted their guard. But neither man nor the powers of the
Roman government nor death himself could prevent God=s plan from being carried out. Nothing
in all of creation could stop the Son of God.
RESURRECTION SCENE 20
Curtain opens to the tomb. Guards posted on either side. Song “Low I the Grave He Lay”
with first verse slow, majestic. At the close of the first verse the guards fall, the stone rolls
back and Jesus appears as the chorus begins.
Jesus comes out of the tomb. MARY MAGDELA and 2 other women enter; the women see
him and all but Mary exit. MARY bows lo to the ground. The other women return bringing
first Peter and John; then the nine others follow. They hug him; examine his hands, his side.
All kneel before him. The choir and crowd enter the scene and slowly move toward Jesus,
except the children who move to Amos. The children should take the positions they took in
the first scene. When Amos starts speaking, everyone else should be kneeling before Jesus.

AMOS: The news he had risen spread like wildfire through the city of Jerusalem and to Emmaus
and beyond. Over 400 people saw the risen savior during the next 40 days. He led us out to the
vicinity of Bethany lifted up his hands and blessed us. (Amos kneels)
JESUS: All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore Go into all the
world and preach the good news to all creation. Make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in
the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Teach them to obey everything I
have commanded you. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not
believe will be condemned. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age. (He
ascends, curtain)
SCENE 21 (before the curtain)
AMOS: (Standing) While he was blessing us, he was taken up into heaven. We worshiped
him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. (Choir and crowd start filtering in before the
curtain) Disciples went into all the world preaching the good news. We made disciples in all
nations, all walks of life. No matter what someone had been, no matter what someone had
done, they found new life as their sins were nailed to the cross of the Savior.
SONG: Just as I am” or “Come just as you are@ and the Invitation to the audience
(Choir sings first verse)
AMOS: Jesus gave us the task of telling others his story. We have done that tonight. Maybe
you are one of the lost sheep he spoke about.
Don=t you wait too long. If you have never accepted Jesus as your Lord and Savior do so
tonight. As the choir sings, come forward. There are people here waiting to receive you,
help you and pray with you. Don=t let what other people might think stop you from coming
to the one who loved you enough to die for you.
(Sing second verse of Come Just as You Are)
AMOS: (Celebratory voice that can now rejoice in Jesus glory about to be revealed) Jesus
told us that whoever acknowledged him before men that he, the Son of Man, would also
acknowledge before the angels of God.
Jesus declared - I tell you, there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one
sinner who repents.

(Curtain opens and Jesus is center stage, robed as a king, wearing a crown with the angels
around him, kneeling, raising their hands to pay him homage)
Choir B A”Crown him Lord of All” The following all enter from the back, kneel before
Jesus, present their gift and move to the side, alternating left and right. A person from Jesus
day alternates with one from modern day.
The Magi enter from the back and lay their crowns before Jesus. A doctor, laying down a
surgical cap. The centurion comes, laying his sword down. A soldier, laying down his gun.
A shepherd, laying down his staff, a businessman lays down his briefcase, the widow with her
2 mites, football (or other sportsman) lays down his helmet and trophy, the demon possessed
girl and her mother lay down a basket with fruit, a motorcycle gang member, his helmet, a
graduate lays down her cap.

(Shoppers reply in fearful tones.)

1: You know, the holiday - Christmas. Shopping, giving  (Alien keeps looking
confused)

ALIEN: (Straightens up and dropping some of the robotic voice to sound enthusiastic and joyful)
Jesus! We had Jesus on my planet! We built a throne from precious gems for Jesus. We brought
presents to Jesus. We worshiped Jesus with thousands of songs and crowned him King of kings
and Lord of Lords. What did you do for Jesus on planet earth?
1: (Ashamed, everyone else drops their head and looks ashamed) We crucified him.

The Innkeeper’s Family (full version)
CHARACTERS: 1 F adult, 1 M adult, 3 children, ranging in age from 4-9
PROPS: Keep away object
COSTUMES: Biblical
SETTING: None specified
RUN TIME: Approximately 7 minutes
At rise. Children playing keep away with an object.
WIFE: (Offstage voice of innkeeper’s wife.) Boys! Jehosheba! Stop that playing! You’ll break
something and Jehovah be praised we need every pot, jar, bowl and pitcher we have. (Entering)
We haven’t had this many customers since ... since the census 11 years age. We’re filled to
overflowing. I won’t have a moment’s rest for the next week. Work, work and more work. But
I’m not complaining. We need the business to keep you three fed and clothed. Have you done
your chores?
Daniel, did you feed the animals?
DANIEL: Yes, I helped father mend the gate. (Husband enters)
HUSBAND: He did and he was very good help indeed.
WIFE: Jehosheba, Did you fill all the jars with water?
JEHOSHEBA: Yes, it took me over 50 trips to the well!
WIFE: Ehud? Did you clean the stable?
EHUD: Yes
WIFE: All of it this time?

EHUD: Yes, mother, all of it.
HUSBAND: Then off to bed. We had to give your room to a family from Jericho so the three of
you will have to sleep in the stable.
ALL: (Ad lib with groaning) The stable! Not the stable.
EHUD: The stable smells.
HUSBAND: It smells does it? I thought you cleaned it. All of it?
EHUD: I did! It’s just...
WIFE: That stable was good enough for a king to sleep in so it will do for the three of you.
JEHOSHEBA: Did a king really sleep there or did you and father just make that up?
WIFE: Your father and I are not making it up. A king really slept there. He was born there. On
a night every bit as crowded as this one. Let me tell you, we were so busy I didn’t sleep for a
week. Thank God there is a Sabbath.
DANIEL: Tell us the story again.
WIFE: (Like they are making a ridiculous request) Do you see all the work your father and I
have to do? Does it look like we have time for stories?
ALL: (Adlibbing, pleading)

Please, please

HUSBAND: I think we have time for one short story before bed.
ALL: Yeah!
WIFE: A story. Maybe I better sit down. (Raising a hand to heaven in a voice resigned to hard
work) Jehovah knows it might be the only rest I get for the next 3 days. If it weren’t for the
Sabbath I would work myself to death. (Daniel gets a chair; mother sits on chair and children
around her.)
HUSBAND: Eleven years ago, Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of
the entire Roman world.
WIFE: The Romans, they like to count everything.
© 2010

HUSBAND: Everyone had to go to his own town to register. So a man named Joseph came
from the town of Nazareth in Galilee because he belonged to the house and line of David. He
came to register with Mary, who was expecting a child. We told them we had no room. But
Mary was about to give birth on our doorstep.
WIFE: What could we do? I would have given her our bed but we had already given it to
another family.
HUSBAND: I told them they could stay in the stable. In no time at all the baby was born. We
wouldn’t have thought a lot about it, we were so busy with all the customers!
WIFE: (Loudly protesting all the work) The laundry! The cooking! The cleaning! Good thing
we have a Sabbath or I would have worn my fingers to the bone during the census. I wouldn’t
have thought another thing about it except for the shepherds.
HUSBAND: Your mother and I were trying to rest, not sleep, just rest.
WIFE: Then this knocking on the door, in the middle of the night. Your father yelled “We’re
full. Go away” but they just kept knocking. If we hadn’t been afraid it was Romans we would
not have answered the door. But it wasn’t the Romans. It was shepherds.
HUSBAND: They told us they had been watching the sheep when an angel of the Lord appeared
to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said
to them, (Changes to an “angel voice”) "Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy
that will be for all the people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is
Christ the Lord. This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a
manger."
HUSBAND: In case they didn’t understand a great company of the heavenly host appeared with
the angel, praising God and saying, “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on
whom his favor rests."
HUSBAND: When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one
another, (Changes to shepherd voice) "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has
happened, which the Lord has told us about.”
WIFE: (Jehosheba begins tugging on her sleeve) So they went door to door and inn to inn
looking for this baby. And he was here. In out stable. In our manger. Stop tugging. Already.
What?

JEHOSHEBA: Aunt Eunice says no king was ever born in a stable. She says those shepherds
might have had wine in their water.
WIFE: (Mock outrage) What does your Aunt Eunice know? She wasn’t there. I was. You think
a Jewish king born in a stable is unbelievable. What about the Romans? The Romans believe
that Romulus and Remas, (Sarcastically) the founders of the mighty Roman Empire (may God
deliver us soon from their iron hand) they believe that Romulus and Remas were raised by a shewolf. Which is harder to believe? A Jewish king born in a stable or a Roman emperor raised by
wolves. Aunt Eunice wasn’t there. Back to the story.
HUSBAND: I was a little curious so I went out to the stable with them. Your mother went too.
I thought the story ... questionable. Unbelievable. Why announce the Messiah to a bunch of
shepherds? Why not at the temple? But there was something about it ... I believed them about
the angels, about the baby. Your mother too. The shepherds told everyone in town. I don’t
know how many of the citizens of Bethlehem believed but most of them came by to see for
themselves the next day.
WIFE: Cluttering up the courtyard, the stable, the entire street. I was never so busy. The inn
was full and then all those extra people coming in and going out. The poor mother, Mary was
her name, could get no rest. The comings! The goings! In our stable.
DANIEL: But why would Jehovah want his son, the Messiah, a king of kings to sleep in a hay
trough?
WIFE: Your father may be an innkeeper, not be a rabbi but still he is a wise man. Listen and
learn.
HUSBAND: We talked about Moses. God chose a slave child to be raised in Pharaoh’s palace
so he would know how to lead. Perhaps God decided to have his son raised by poor people so he
would know how to serve.
WIFE: A servant, you may ask? The Messiah – a servant? Yes!
HUSBAND: The prophet Isaiah said he would be. "Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my
chosen one in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him and he will bring justice to the nations.
After the shepherds went back to their flocks we talked with this Joseph. He was a good man, a
humble man. A carpenter. He wondered why God chose him and Mary to raise his son.
WIFE: And not just a king, although raising a king would be a job. But the son of El Shaddai,
the son of the living God.

HUSBAND: Joseph did not know why God picked him. He could have picked any man in all
of Israel. Why not a rabbi? Why not a priest? Why not the high priest himself? Why a
carpenter from Nazareth? It is not up to us to question God. It is up to us to accept and do.
HUSBAND: Joseph was a humble man. He prayed that night. I could tell it was not the first
time he prayed for wisdom to raise the baby they named Jesus. I would imagine it was not the
last time either. Raising God’s own son would require lots of prayer and hard work.
(Thoughtfully, with wonder) God had chosen a simple man of trade and an ordinary girl. We
don’t ask why. We do as we are told.
WIFE: (Changing voice to one of motherly authority) Speaking of which. You need your rest.
There will be more work tomorrow with all these guests. Off to bed and no more complaining
about sleeping in the stable.
ALL (Ad libbing) Yes, mother, good night, father… (Children exit)
WIFE (Contemplating) How could Joseph have seen this: this road to Bethlehem, a stable filled
with hay,
HUSBAND: Yes, such a strange way to save the world.

(Woman enters carrying a baby; she speaks softly and tenderly when talking to the baby, almost
in awe) John, child of my old age. Sleep well tonight. (places baby in cradle). Until you came I
was barren. (remembering with pain) A curse and shame to any Israelite woman. I understood
when Rachel cried out to her husband – give me children or I die. Like Hannah, I was loved by
my husband, but that could not fill the empty, aching void within my heart.
(mood lightens) The day your father, Zachariah came home from serving at the temple he could
not speak. Still he managed to tell me he had spoken with the angel Gabriel, that we would have
a son, us in our old age. He said our son was to be dedicated to God even from my womb.
(looking at the baby) You, John, would turn many of our people back to God. Our son would
come in the spirit and power of Elijah.
I laughed – not like Sarah, in disbelief, but for joy and knowing that if God ordained it, he would
make a way. I spent my months in seclusion, praying and meditating on how we should bring
you up. Then Mary, my young relative came.
She should have been home, preparing to be married. She had just been betrothed to Joseph.
When she walked through the door, you gave me such a kick. It was as though you spoke,
"Mother, what good is it for you to bear Messiah's forerunner unless someone else bears
Messiah?" (joyfully) The realization broke on me like a wave of the sea and washed over me,

bringing chills of joy. Mary's baby was the Messiah!
We laughed and cried together. (remembering with laughter) I thought your father would burst
from not being able to speak. I’m sure he wanted to compare notes with Mary about Gabriel’s
visits.
She returned home and in due course I had you. I am a doubly blessed woman – blessed with a
son of my own and blessed to be alive when the Messiah will come. The Messiah – the hope and
consolation of Israel. The counselor, Prince of Peace, Mighty God. How wondrous. (picking up
baby from cradle) Mary’s time is close. The Messiah could come at any time (pause to cradle
child closer) Maybe even tonight.

Elizabeth and Zechariah
CHARACTERS: 1 M, 1 F
COSTUMES: Biblical
PROPS: Baby
SETTING: Israel, just before Christ is born
AT: Rise. A room in a Jewish home. A cradle is the central feature with a stool beside it. Elizabeth
enters carrying a baby.
ELIZ: John, child of my old age. Sleep well tonight. (Places baby in cradle). Until you came, my
life was one of longing and emptiness (She sits on the stool. Remembering the shame and
heartbreak) I understood when Rachel cried out to her husband – give me children or I die.
(Zechariah enters) But now, like it was with Sarah it is with me, a child born to me in my old age. It
is a time of gladness!
ZECHARIAH: (Laughing, playfully) Elizabeth, it is time to let our son get some rest.
ELIZ: Yes, he has quite a task set before him. Tell me again what the scriptures say.
ZECHARIAH: (Quoting) And he will go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn
the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make
ready a people prepared for the Lord. Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord
their God. (Pause) He will be great in the sight of the Lord.
ELIZ: (Smiling) Yes, in time he will be. But he is such a tiny thing now. (With pride) Our John, our
joy and delight. As Gabriel said, many will rejoice because of his birth. And they did. This house
was filled to overflowing with singing and praises to God. And you made up a song. Sing it for me.

(Zechariah shakes his head “No”) Then at least repeat the words. (Zechariah starts to decline;
mischievously) You never know when an angel may take the power of speech from you again.
ZECHARIAH: (Chuckles.) Very well. (Zechariah pauses to collect his thoughts. He speaks to
God using a commanding voice, yet not loud enough to disturb the baby. Elizabeth keeps one hand
on the baby but her eyes never leave her husband as he speaks. She nods in affirmation of the words)
"Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,
because he has come and has redeemed his people.
He has raised up a horn of salvation for us
in the house of his servant David
(as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),
salvation from our enemies
and from the hand of all who hate us—
to show mercy to our fathers
and to remember his holy covenant,
the oath he swore to our father Abraham:
to rescue us from the hand of our enemies,
and to enable us to serve him without fear
in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
Zechariah pauses, steps closer to the cradle and places one hand upon the baby
And you, my child, (Elizabeth begins smiling broadly and steals a glimpse or two at John) will be
called a prophet of the Most High;
for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,
to give his people the knowledge of salvation
through the forgiveness of their sins,
because of the tender mercy of our God,
by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven
to shine on those living in darkness
and in the shadow of death,
to guide our feet into the path of peace."
ELIZ: We have a son, one ordained by El Shaddai himself! But I fear it will not be so easy with
Mary. Her time must be at hand and with her having to travel to Bethlehem for the census…. If John
were older I’d suggest we go meet them ourselves.
ZECHARIAH: (Face becomes clouded) She is young, Elizabeth. God is with her.
ELIZ: But the place is crowded with not only those registering from the house of David but also all
the Romans. The Romans are not kind to us Jews.
ZECHARIAH: I do not fear the Romans in this instance but King Herod himself. Herod never
hesitated to put anyone, including his own family, to death when they threatened his throne. If word
gets out of a Messiah – a future, rival king – Herod might act violently to protect his throne.

15
16

ELIZABETH: Yes, Herod might do that. He had his brother in law the high priest killed.
ZECHARIAH: And we both know who it is Herod will find and where he will be found.
ELIZ: (Concerned) Then Mary, Joseph and the baby will all be at risk. (With dawning horror) Do
you think that puts our John in danger?
ZECHARIAH: (Far away) It could. (Snaps back to the present) My time of service is over at the
temple. Rather than stay here I thought we might move into a quiet place in the desert….
ELIZ: (Quietly, no opposition evident in her voice) Move? Away from out home? Our families?
Before seeing Mary’s child?
ZECHARIAH: Yes. I think we might endanger them by even visiting them. Everyone knows what a
miracle John is.
ELIZ: When?
ZECHARIAH: I feel we must do so right away, Elizabeth, if you think you have gained enough
strength.
ELIZ: God has given me a son in my old age. He will give me whatever strength I lack. (Not whiny,
matter-of-fact) But Zachariah, it’s lonely and harsh in the desert. It’s not a hospitable place.
ZECHARIAH: Exactly. A perfect place to raise our only son, Elizabeth. If Herod comes looking for
the Messiah it will not be to worship him. I fear for our son’s safety. We did not wait all these years
to see harm come to him.
ELIZ: Of course we did not. Our son has a vital mission and no sacrifice is too great to see that he
fulfills his destiny.
ZECHARIAH: Moses, young David spent years in the wilderness. And Elijah. Elijah hid from
Ahab in the desert.
ELIZ: (Almost dreamy) Yes, Elijah. (In the present) And our John will come in the spirit and power
of Elijah
ZECHARIAH: We waited for years for him to be born. A few more years and Herod will be dead.
Is that too much?
ELIZ: No, nothing is too much. (Resolutely) Nothing is too much for either our son or our God. I’ll
start to gather a few things. (She rises, gives John a lingering caress and exits. Zachariah smoothes
the hair on John’s head tenderly then looks upward)
ZECHARIAH: Thank you for John. Lord, make us the kind of parents he needs, ones who will bring
him up in the nurture and admonition of your name. And we ask that you be with Mary and Joseph
16
17

as you are with your son. Your son who was with you from the beginning, by whom all things were
created. Who is coming now in a body of flesh and blood. (Drops his head to gaze at John)
(Toward the audience but not at the audience) The Messiah – the hope and consolation of Israel. The
counselor, Prince of Peace, Mighty God. (With awe) How wondrous. (Picking up baby from cradle
and looking at him intently) Our Messiah will be here soon. (Pause to cradle child closer) Maybe
even tonight. (Zechariah bows his head until it gently rests against the John’s tiny forehead)

The Light of the World
CHARACTERS: 3 M, 1 F, 5 either
COSTUMES: see below
PROPS: see below
SETTING: Bare stage
NARRATOR: (puppet) Optional; Have puppet holding a book made from black poster board folded
in half to look like a book cover. Title the book “The Story of the Light of the World” in glow in the
dark paint.
KING: crown and robe
PRINCESS: Beautiful princess dress and crown, rag costume with bandages
PRINCE: Simple street clothes OR Biblical
DARK MAN: All black including a black hoodie or ski mask that hides the face, apple, chains
(human)
3 MESSENGERS: optional scrolls
STAR CARRIER: A glowing star with a candle inside
At rise: NARRATOR and KING siting on throne, dimly lit
NARR: Once upon a time there was a king. And the king said
KING: Let there be light (Light brightens)
NARR: And there was light. The king saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from
the darkness. He called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” The king ruled over his
kingdom of light and it was all good. Then the King adopted a daughter and made her a princess.
(PRINCESS enters and is further illuminated) She had everything she needed.
NARR: One day darkness entered the kingdom. (DARK MAN enters holding out an apple to
PRINCESS. PRINCESS takes off her crown, trades it for apple and bites the apple. It is bitter and
she drops it in disgust. KING looks horrified)
NARR: The princess traded away her crown for a lie and in doing so, sold herself as a slave to the
darkness. (DARK MAN wraps chains around her wrists binding them) She threw away her birthright
and became a poor, blind, miserable commoner. (PRINCESS and DARK MAN exit into darkness)
The darkness surrounded her and though she cried pitifully over what she had done, she could neither
regain her royal status nor free herself from slavery.
17
18

VOICE of PRINCESS: (calling out, afraid) Where is the light? Where is my father the king? I am
afraid. Help me!
NARR: The more the princess tried to save herself, the more she stumbled. Her beautiful clothes
became rags and many wounds were all she got for her efforts. (PRINCE enters to KING) The king
was sad. His son, the prince, too grieved.
KING: She has traded away her birthright and now she suffers. She cannot find her own way from the
darkness. She cannot buy her own freedom.
PRINCE: Then I will save her, though it cost all I am and have. (exits). PRINCESS re-enters,
disheveled and dressed in rags with wounds and bloody bandages including one over her eyes. She
collapses in a miserable heap under a dim red light held by DARK MAN.
NARR: So the king sent messengers on ahead so the princess would be ready to be saved by the
prince.
MESSENGER 1: The moon will shine like the sun, and the sunlight will be seven times brighter, like
the light of seven full days, when the LORD binds up the bruises of his people and heals the wounds
of the princess. (PRINCESS examines her wounds and winces as she moves because they are so
painful. When she speaks, it is with desperate pain, shame and remorse)
PRINCESS: I want to be healed.
MESSENGER 2: The prince will lead the blind by ways they have not known, along unfamiliar paths
He will guide them; He will turn the darkness into light before them and make the rough places
smooth. These are the things the prince will do; He will not forsake his princess.
PRINCESS: I want to see again.
MESSENGER 3: The sun will no more be your light by day, nor will the brightness of the moon
shine on you, for the Prince will be your everlasting light, and your King will be your glory. Your sun
will never set again, and your moon will wane no more; the Prince will be your everlasting light, and
your days of sorrow will end.
PRINCESS: Yes, let my sorrow end.
NARR: And so the prince stepped down into darkness. SONG Light of the world you stepped down
into darkness. STAR CARRIER appears holding a lighted star over the PRINCE. Slowly they make
their way toward the PRINCESS during the song.
NARR: A star served as a beacon of light, drawing those who were wise to the prince. Through this
prince all things had been made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life,
and that life was the light of all mankind. His light shone in the darkness, and the darkness could not
overcome it. (DARK MAN forces PRINCESS to take his red light, he sabotages the reconciliation,
whispering lies in the princess’ ears and pulling her back when she reaches for the PRINCE.)
Yet, though the world, including the princess, was made through the Prince, the princess did not
18
19

recognize him. The darkness blinded her. If she would only receive him, he would give the right to
become a child of the king once again.
PRINCE: (Reaching toward her and gently calling for her) You are a child of the light and a child of
the day. You not belong to the night or to the darkness, but you are a princess, daughter of the king
who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light. (DARK MAN puts the PRINCESSES
hands over her ears)
NARR: But the princess closed her ears as well as her eyes.
PRINCE: (more urgently) I have come into the world as a light, so you do not have to stay in
darkness. Whoever walks in the dark does not know where they are going. Believe in my light while
you have the light, so that you once again may become a child of the king. (As PRINCESS starts to
reach for the PRINCE, DARK MAN gets between them and jerks her back to her misery)
NARR: But the princess did not leave the darkness. (DARK MAN moves slyly behind the prince, He
pantomimes nailing his feet to a cross.)
PRINCE: (pleading most urgently, holding out his arms to her) I am the light of the world. Whoever
follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life. (DARK MAN physically takes
the PRINCE’s arms and pantomimes nailing them to a cross) While I am in the world, I am
the light of the world. You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk to me while you
have the light, before darkness overtakes you. (Pause for 2 beats but the princess does NOT come.
PRINCE bows head in death. KING, face filled with grief, turns away from the PRINCE.
NARR: Yet the princess did not come to him, though he paid for her life with his own. PRINCESS is
crying, loudly at first, then muffled occasional sobs. PRINCE and DARKMAN exit.
NARR: This is the message we have heard from the Prince and declare to you: the King is light; in
him there is no darkness at all. If we walk in the King’s light, as the Prince is in the light, we have
fellowship with one another, and the blood of the Prince, his Son, purifies us. (PRINCE appears next
to NARR)
PRINCE: You (pointing to audience) are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be
hidden. (STAR CARRIER takes candle from under the star and holds it up) Neither do people light a
candle and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the
house. (STAR CARRIER drops star backstage or hooks it above the stage to continue to be seen)
PRINCE: In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and
glorify your Father in heaven. For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live
as children of light. For the king, who said, (KING turns back around)
KING: “Let light shine out of darkness,”
PRINCE: … made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of His glory
displayed in the face of Christ.
PRINCE: Who will add their candle? Who will add their light? Who will reach my princess, all my
princesses, who are in darkness? Sing with us. (Cast begins to sing This Little light of mine.

Audience members should be encouraged to add their voices. As they do the PRINCESS takes off eye
bandages and finally comes to the prince and KING who welcome her with joy)
MARY’S CHOICE
CHARACTERS: 10 (3F, 2M, 4 either)
COSTUMES: Biblical
PROPS: None specified
SETTING: Anywhere in Nazareth
RUN TIME: 6 minutes
SCRIPTURE REFERENCES: Luke 1 & 2, Esther 4, Isaiah 49:6, Hebrews 11 & 12, Psalms 23, 2
Corinthians 6:2
AT RISE: GABRIEL is center stage. MARY slightly to one side, busy, unaware of GABRIEL’s
presence until he speaks to her.
GABRIEL: (to the audience) In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, God sent me, the
angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, to a virgin. (GABRIEL takes a step toward and
addresses MARY)
GABRIEL: Greetings, Mary, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you. (MARY starts
in surprise, draws back a step and appears troubled at the rest of his words but not frightened)
Do not be afraid, Mary; you have found favor with God. You will conceive and give birth to a
son, and you are to call him Jesus.
MARY: How will this be since I am a virgin?
GABRIEL: The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow
you. (with delight) So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God. (DEMONS move
stealthily toward MARY before they speak, seeming afraid to draw GABRIEL’s notice. They
speak at first, in hushed tones close to her ear, and then back off as if being near MARY or
GABRIEL is painful)
DEMON 1: Mary. You’re pledged to be married to a man named Joseph. Don’t do anything to
mess this up. (MARY can hear the voices of the demons but she can’t actually see the demons.
She should peer about as if in a dark room, able to tell where the voices are coming from but not
make eye contact with any of them. Her face should be visible to the audience so they can see
her reactions)
GABRIEL: Your son Jesus will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord
God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over Jacob’s descendants
forever; his kingdom will never end
DEMON 1: (backing off a bit, sounding like a kindly Jewish grandmother) This is nonsense talk.
You’re family’s not royalty; you’re not even Jewish nobility. How could a son of yours become
king?
MARY: Joseph is a descendant of David.

20
21

DEMON 1: He’s a nice man, maybe a bit poor, but a good catch. But royalty? No. He’s a
carpenter. He builds furniture, not kingdoms. This is too far-fetched.
DEMON 2: (more insidious but not threatening) If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
Tell this apparition to get lost. He’s talking nonsense. Utter nonsense.
GABRIEL: Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who
was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month. (pause) For no word from God will ever
fail. (DEMONS draw back and huddle together for support at those words. But they continue to
try to influence MARY. A touch of desperation creeps into their voices)
DEMON 2: What about your reputation? Do you think Joseph is going to believe you’re
carrying the king of the universe or that you have strayed?
DEMON 1: The law says to stone women for impurity.
DEMON 2: You could lose your life.
GABRIEL: Lord, open her eyes that she may see that she is surrounded by a great cloud of
witnesses. (DEMONS 1 & 2 withdraw. As good characters appear, Mary is able to see them.
Her face should be a canvas, showing her reactions to their encouragement)
ESTHER: Mary, I once feared losing my life. Thank the Lord Mordecai helped me realize that I
might have come to my royal position as queen to save my people.
MARY: Queen Esther?
ESTHER: Yes, Mary. God brought me where he needed me to be to serve him and his people,
not myself. If I had remained silent, refused to take the risk, God would have delivered my
people through another. However, I would have perished.
MARY: (remembering what she has been taught and finishing the story) So you risked your life
to save the Jews from Haman.
ESTHER: (nodding in agreement and speaking with evident joy) And through Jesus, the one of
whom Gabriel speaks, not just the Jews will be saved, but the Gentiles as well.
GABRIEL: (prophetically and expansive in his joy) It is too small a thing for Jesus the servant
to restore the tribes of Jacob and bring back those of Israel. He will also be a light for
the Gentiles that Jehovah’s salvation may reach to the ends of the earth.
DEMON 3: (forceful, has a hard edge) Gentiles. Gentiles like these filthy Romans who
slaughter our people and blaspheme the name of the Lord. Who wants to save Gentiles? Mary,
this is crazy talk. You don’t want to do this. Risking one’s life is fine for a queen, but you’re a –
how do I say this nicely? – a nobody.
DAVID: (has entered quietly, behind GABRIEL and dramatically steps out to be seen) They
thought the same of me. The youngest son, a shepherd tending a few sheep. Then when I said I
would take on Goliath, they called me crazy too.
MARY: David? King David?
21
22

DAVID: Yes, Mary. (taking her hands and speaking with love and conviction) You are of my
line, my blood, royal blood. Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young …
RAHAB: (Stepping dramatically from behind GABRIEL and coming around to the other side of
MARY, forcing DEMON 3 to step back) Or female.
DAVID: (introducing them) This is my great-great grandmother, Rahab.
RAHAB: I too risked my life to save my family.
DEMON 3: She’s a prostitute, a filthy Gentile prostitute.
RAHAB: Yet even I was found righteous by placing my faith in God and acting on it by
protecting the spies.
DEMON 4: (cringing entry from the opposite side of the other demons; pleading) Mary, you
don’t want to do this. You’d be all alone.
DAVID: The Lord is my shepherd (RAHAB joins in) I shall not want. Yea, thought I (MARY
joins in) walk in the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.
DEMON 4: (last-ditch effort) Now isn’t a good time to make such a monumental decision. Ask
for a couple of days to think it over. There’s plenty of time.
GABRIEL: (proclaiming forcefully, letting his words push the demons back to the farthest
corners) Now is the time of God’s favor, now is the day of salvation
MARY: (bows in humility, lifts her face and answers confidently) I am the Lord’s servant. May
your word to me be fulfilled. (Demons and GABRIEL exit; other characters pull MARY to her
feet and hug her.)

Stage is split into two, each part with separate lighting. Scenes alternate between live interviews by a
reporter being “played” as clips and a studio where three commentators are seated behind a table or on
stools to be interviewed by the TV Host.
Lights illuminate only the portion of the stage where action is taking place. Actors in opposite scene
remain frozen during the other scene and come back to life when the light is on them.
Scene 1: The Panel
TV HOST: Tonight we bring some commentary on the events in the capital district. With us we have
Gamaliel, a teacher of Jewish law, a man well respected for his learning. Anna, daughter of Phanuel, of
the tribe of Asher. She’ll be commenting from a woman’s perspective on these events. Lastly we have
Antonius, a Roman centurion and right hand man of Quirinius, the governor of Syria. He’ll be
commenting from an outsider’s point of view on this matter.
First we’d like to show some clips of past news broadcasts covering the events.
Scene 2: Shepherds
REPORTER: Viewers, we are live in Bethlehem bringing you breaking news of a savior’s birth. I’m here
with Josiah. Josiah, you work in the area, right. (Behind Josiah and the reporter and 2 child shepherds,
waving into the camera and trying to insert themselves into the scene.)
JOSIAH: Yes, I’m a shepherd. I keep watch over the temple flocks.
© 2010 
REPORTER: How did you find out about the baby?
JOSIAH: An angel of the Lord appeared to us. There was a light like the glory of the Lord
REPORTER: Have you ever seen the glory of the Lord?
JOSIAH: No but I imagine this was it with the angels and all.
REPORTER: What did the angel say?
JOSIAH: Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. Today in the
town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord
REPORTER: And by town of David he meant….?
JOSIAH: Bethlehem. It was always known as David’s town. Then the angel said ‘This will be a sign to
you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger’
REPORTER: A manger? A feed bin for animals?
JOSIAH: Didn’t you think that odd – the Savior of the world lying in a feed trough?
JOSIAH:: I was just overwhelmed by the whole thing and didn’t really analyze it at the time. I mean, first
we were terrified with the appearance of the angel – oh, and there was an entire host of angels backing
him. A huge number.
REPORTER: How did you feel? What thoughts were going through your mind?
JOSIAH: As I said, first terrified, then I just wanted to praise God right along with the angels. They were
saying "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests."
REPORTER: Are the angels still out there singing?
JOSIAH: No they went back to heaven. So I suggested we go to Bethlehem and see this thing that had
happened, which the Lord had told us about.
REPORTER: (turning to the kids finally. They become tongue tied and camera shy) Let me get a
comment here. What’s your name?
BEN: (deer caught in the headlights) Benjamin.
REPORTER: What happened when you got to the stable?
BEN: Um… I didn’t go. I had to stay with the sheep.
REPORTER: OK Josiah, what happened at the stable?

JOSIAH: We hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby just like the angel said. After paying
our respects we went to friends in town and told them the good news.
REPORTER: How did they react?
JOSIAH: Amazed. We have been looking so long for a Messiah…
REPORTER: So your fear turned into praise?
JOSIAH: Yes.
REPORTER: Thank you. I see the baby’s mother, Mary, is available for an interview. Let’s just pop over
there. (Lights out. Shepherds exit and Mary and Joseph get in place)
Scene 3: Comments of the Shepherds
TV HOST: Gamaliel, what do you see in the shepherds reaction to the news of Jesus’ birth?
GAMALIEL: Fear is only natural, at first, but when they hear the news it quickly turned into praise. That
in turn led to witnessing to others.
TV HOST: No one likes to keep good news to themselves.
GAMALIEL: Here were some men, who by the very nature of their work were hardly able to keep to the
laws of Moses regarding ceremonial washing and all. Yet, when the news came, they praised God and
shared it with others.
TV HOST: Don’t you think it rather odd that the news didn’t come to the religious leaders first?
GAMALIEL: Yes and no. Shepherds have always been close to God’s heart. Abraham, Isaac and Jacob
were all shepherds. God trained Moses to lead with a 40 year stint as a shepherd. But the most famous
shepherd, David, was not only a man after God’s own heart but he was the shepherd king and forefather of
the Messiah.
TV HOST: So you see some historical reasoning for shepherds to hear the news first.
GAMALIEL: Yes. I do.
TV HOST: Let’s move to the next segment of this first broadcast, where Mary and Joseph, the parents of
the baby, are interviewed. (GAMALIEL waves A over and speaks quietly off camera and mic) I stand
corrected on a technicality – the mother of the baby and her husband.
Scene 4: Mary and Joseph
REPORTER: Ma’am. Congratulations.
© 2010 Kathy Applebee Find royalty free Christian Drama skits at my Fools for Christ website at 
MARY: Thank you.
REPORTER: How does it feel to be the mother of the savior of the world?
MARY: I’m treasuring every moment.
REPORTER: Here’s the father now. Why are you in a stable with the Savior of the World?
JOSEPH: I’m not the baby’s father. I’m just Mary’s husband.
REPORTER: Who is the father?
JOSEPH: God. Like Isaiah prophesied, a virgin shall conceive.
REPORTER: That’s impossible.
MARY: Nothing is impossible with God.
REPORTER: So you are claiming this child is half mortal and half divine?
JOSEPH: No, Jesus is 100% God and 100% man.
REPORTER: Do you think people are going to buy this story?
JOSEPH: To be honest I didn’t buy it until an angel visited me. I had intended to divorce Mary quietly.
But after talking to the angel I reconsidered. The angel said not to be afraid to take her as my wife. We
were to name the baby Jesus because he would save the people from their sins. He’d be called Immanuel
or “God with us.”
REPORTER: So why a stable?
JOSEPH: There was no room in the inn.
REPORTER: (fiddling with ear piece.) I think we’re going to cut to the palace and an interview with one
of King Herod’s people.
Scene 5: Commentary Mary and Joseph
TV HOST: Let’s start with you, Anna. You actually met Mary, is that correct?
ANNA: Yes. They brought Jesus to the temple on the 8th day of his birth for circumcision.
TV HOST: How did you happen to be in the right place at the right time?
ANNA: I’m an 84 year old a prophetess that lives in the temple. I spend my days and nights
worshipping, praying and fasting. Being a widow for these past years I can do that.
TV HOST: As a woman, how do you see Mary?
© 2010 Kathy Applebee Find royalty free Christian Drama skits at my Fools for Christ website at 
ANNA: I see a woman full of faith. She had the most to lose here. As an unwed mother, she was in a
position to lose the respect of her family, friends, and the community. She could have lost her betrothed
husband and had nothing.
GAMALIEL: You see under Jewish law Joseph had the right not only to divorce her. He could have had
her brought up on charges that would have led to her being stoned to death as an adulterer.
TV HOST: Do you think she had second thoughts during her pregnancy?
ANNA: It is hard to say but I doubt it. God had confirmed to her all he said not just with the angel
Gabriel’s visit but also with words from her own relative – Elizabeth. Now Elizabeth wasn’t as old as I
am but she was well past her child bearing years. An angel visits her husband, promising a baby. She
becomes pregnant. The baby inside her leaps for joy when Mary enters.
GAMALIEL: Throughout our Jewish history barren and even elderly women having children was a sign
of great things. Sarah was 90 when she had Isaac. Rebekah, Isaac’s wife, was barren for years as was
Jacob’s wife, Rachel. Samuel and Samson, two outstanding judges had been born to childless women.
ANTONIUS: Even to an outsider, Elizabeth’s pregnancy is worth note.
TV HOST: What about Joseph, what do you see happening in his mind?
ANTONIUS: From the viewpoint of an outsider, I see a man of action who does what needs to be done
even if it doesn’t go along with popular opinion. In that regard he reminds me a bit of our Caesar. Julius
Caesar had no male heirs so he adopted one and did all he could to see that heir succeed.
GAMALIEL: I see that the word of God leads to reconsideration. King David had in mind to build the
temple. But when the word of God came to him through Nathan the prophet that he was NOT to build the
temple, he submitted to God’s will. Here we have Joseph, a direct descendent of David, doing the same
thing.
TV HOST: How so.
GAMALIEL: He had in mind to put Mary aside but reconsidered when the word of the Lord came to him
through the angel Gabriel.
ANNA: He had a servant’s heart, just like Mary. You have to remember Mary’s words to the Angel: “I
am the Lord’s servant. May it be to me as you have said." Mary’s submissive faith led to trust.
TV HOST: Let’s watch another clip of Herod’s reaction to the news

Scene 6: Herod
REPORTER 2: I’m live at King Herod’s palace with General Joab. General, how’s the king taking the
news?

JOAB: Not well, I’m afraid. He’s pretty jealous of his throne.
REPORTER 2: I remember back when he suspected some family members were vying for power. Didn’t
he have some of them executed?
JOAB: Yes. King Herod will not tolerate treason. He… (HEROD bursts into the scene, shoves JOAB out
of the way and grabs the mic)
HEROD: (Emotional and forceful) This is your king. If any of you know where this baby is, report it to
me immediately. (Starting to catch himself and school his emotions, gets syrupy sweet) That’s because I
too want to worship him.
REPORTER 2: You aren’t concerned that this Jesus could be a rival king?
HEROD: (lying through his teeth) Of course not. I am secure in my wealth and power, in my luxurious
lifestyle. (getting firmer) I’m in control here and intend to stay in control. So if any of you viewers have
any information on this baby, drop by the palace. You will be richly rewarded. (getting a bit harsh) And
if you happen to see some strange Magi types from the east, I’d like information on them as well. (Hands
back the mic and stomps off dragging Joab behind him)
Scene 7: Commentary on Herod
TV HOST: Let’s start with you, Antonius. What do you see happening here?
.ANTONIUS: A man afraid of losing his throne. His reaction when the Magi failed to return shows us
how deep his fear ran.
ANNA: (with heartfelt sympathy) The slaughter of all those innocent babies.
ANTONIUS: He didn’t just kill newborns. His orders included those up to two years of age.
TV HOST: Any speculation why?
ANTONIUS: Obviously he didn’t want to take any chances. He did know the exact time of the star’s
appearance. Now this is just my speculation, but I think he might have been trying to eliminate the child of
Zechariah and Elizabeth as well.
TV HOST: Did he even know of this child?
GAMALIEL: Probably. Jesus and John were born within months of each other and the news of a priest
having a baby at his and his wife’s advanced ages would be news. As I said, throughout Israel’s history
the children of barren women had been movers and shakers.
TV HOST: So people might be anticipating this child to do something out of the ordinary.
GAMALIEL: Herod called together those of us who were teachers of the law and the chief priests. The
subject could have come up. After all, Zechariah’s inability to speak for all those months coupled with the
unusual naming of the child kept the child a subject of speculation.
© 2010 Kathy Applebee Find royalty free Christian Drama skits at my Fools for Christ website at 
TV HOST: What do you mean about the naming?
GAMALIEL: John was still speechless at the child’s naming. Elizabeth was insisting he be called John,
despite everyone discouraging it since they had no relatives by that name. Elizabeth insisted and
Zechariah finally wrote “His name id John”. Boom. John can speak. Everyone there remembers that
ceremony.
TV HOST: So why would Herod want John executed?
GAMALIEL: It’s just speculation but Herod may have been thinking killing them both made his throne
more secure.
ANTONIUS: Herod was all about self security. If you notice, Herod pretended to want to worship the
child. He met with the Magi secretly to ask what time the star appeared. I think we can see by his actions
that self centeredness leads to death.
GAMALIEL: Self centeredness leads to sin, from a religious standpoint.
TV HOST: I think we can agree that selfishness is never a positive trait. Next we’re going to play a clip
we filmed in secret. The woman is veiled to hide her identity for reasons that will become apparent.
Scene 8: Woman from the East
REPORTER: I understand you have agreed to speak on behalf of your group only if you can remain
anonymous. Do you fear for your life?
WOMAN: (She sounds mysterious and foreign) No. Not my life. The life of another who is destined to
change history. The one foretold.
REPORTER: Tell us what you can about yourself.
WOMAN: I am the wife of a servant of Magi from the east. Our caravan has been following a star.
REPORTER: And the star was leading you to….
WOMAN: The King of the Jews.
REPORTER: King Herod?
WOMAN: No, one far more important than that fox. We came to worship The King of Kings. To bring
him our gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.
REPORTER: Did you find this King.
WOMAN: Yes. But that is all I can say. The dream forbids more.
REPORTER: What dream? (WOMAN raises her hand to indicate the interview is over. She draws her
veil to make sure her features are concealed)
© 2010 Kathy Applebee Find royalty free Christian Drama skits at my Fools for Christ website at 
Scene 9: Commentary on Woman from the East
TV HOST: The clip is short but give me your impressions. Anna?
ANNA: They traveled hundreds of miles in difficult conditions to worship. I have it easy, living in the
temple, but they showed true dedication to worship.
TV HOST: What I’m wondering is how did these astrologers know a star would lead them to the King of
Kings?
GAMALIEL: This is pure speculation but I suspect they were descendents of either Daniel or people in
Babylon and Persia who worked with him. Daniel was a supervisor who had proven himself and his God
superior to theirs time and again.
ANNA: Daniel also had been given visions of the coming times.
GAMALIEL: We’ll never know but he might have given orders to watch for signs that were passed down
and heeded because of his prominent position as a wise man in two separate empires.
ANTONIUS: The legacy of a man like that could affect generations.
TV HOST: As an outsider as the Easterners were Antonius, what do you notice?
ANTONIUS: They defied King Herod by returning home another way. As foreigners they could have
been in some trouble defying a king on his turf had they been caught. They showed great courage.
TV HOST: Wouldn’t they have stuck out like sore thumbs and been easy to trace?
ANTONIUS: My governor, Quirinius, had called for a census of the entire Roman world. The place was
pretty crowded with people from all over returning to their home towns to register.
ANNA: Plus they were wealthy and wise men. They could have easily arranged for disguises, decoys.
TV HOST: There was some talk about them being warned in a dream as well. Gamaliel?
GAMALIEL: I see another parallel with David. Just a short diversion, if I may?
TV HOST: Alright, but we have one more clip I want to get in and have comments on. Make it short.
GAMALIEL: David was told to build an altar on another man’s property to worship God and stop a
deadly plague. When the owner offered it to him for free, David refused, saying he would not give an
offering that cost him nothing.
TV HOST: And how does this tie in with the Magi from the East?
GAMALIEL: Worship leads to giving. They came not as spectators wanting to view history as it
unfolded but as worshippers who wanted to give. It is hard to express love without giving.
© 2010 Kathy Applebee Find royalty free Christian Drama skits at my Fools for Christ website at 
ANNA: They gave of their material wealth, which was needed. Mary and Joseph were broke when they
came to the temple. All they could afford were two birds, the poor man’s sacrifice. God may have
provided the means for their escape and support through these Gentiles. But more than the costly gifts we
have to bear in mind they gave also a part of themselves because they risked their lives defying Herod.
ANTONIUS: This is true even in Roman culture. Those who worship with words only are at the lowest
echelon. Those who give of their possessions are higher up. But it is those who give of their means and
their own lives we prize most highly in the republic.
GAMALIEL: I would agree with that. True worship leads to giving of ones means and self.
TV HOST: Let’s quickly move to the clip of Simeon in the temple.
Scene 10: Simeon
REPORTER: Simeon, you were one of the first to react to the Christ child in a public religious forum.
How did you come to see him?
SIMEON: I had been told by the Holy Spirit that I would not die before I had seen the Lord's Christ.
That hope clung to me like a weed to the soil. That day I was moved by the Spirit to go into the temple
courts. When Mary and Joseph brought Jesus to do for him what the custom of the Law required, I knew
my hope had come.
REPORTER: What did you do?
SIMEON: I took Jesus in my arms and praised God, saying:
Sovereign Lord, as you have promised,
you now dismiss your servant in peace.
For my eyes have seen your salvation,
which you have prepared in the sight of all people,
a light for revelation to the Gentiles
and for glory to your people Israel."
REPORTER: How did his parents react?
SIMEON: They marveled at what was said about him. I blessed them and said to Mary, his mother: "This
child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be spoken
against, so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your own soul too."
REPORTER: Can you elaborate on that last statement?
SIMEON: The Messiah is to be a suffering servant. His mother will suffer because he does.

Scene 11: Final Commentary
© 2010 Kathy Applebee Find royalty free Christian Drama skits at my Fools for Christ website at 
TV HOST: His mother will suffer as he does. That’s what Simeon said. Anna, what do you think that
means?
ANNA: A mother’s heart is bound closely to that of her children.
TV HOST: Antonius, as a Gentile, comment on the reference to Gentiles.
ANTONIUS: The Jews are quite blatant about excluding all non-Jews. The fact that Simeon includes
Gentiles shows that this Jesus is someone unique, able to transcend racial and cultural differences.
TV HOST: Gamaliel?
GAMALIEL: I think we see here that hope leads to fulfillment. We all have hopes for the future. When
our hopes are grounded in the word of God we can count on them to be fulfilled.
TV HOST: Our time is almost over. From Simeon’s reaction we see that hope leads to fulfillment. Let
me let each of you make a couple of last comments on what people’s reactions to the birth of Christ
teaches us. Ladies first.
ANNA: Mary teaches us that faith leads to trust. Joseph teaches us that God’s word leads to
reconsideration.
ANTONIUS: Herod’s reaction teachers us that self centeredness leads to sin and death.
GAMALIEL: The shepherds teach that praise leads to witnessing and the Magi that worship leads to
giving.
TV HOST: Thank you all for being on today’s show. And we thank you viewers for tuning in. God bless
and Good night.

JASMINE’S STAR
By Kathy Applebee
CHARACTERS: see production notes for details
COSTUMES: & PROPS: see production notes at end
SETTING: Middle East, 1 A.D.
RUN TIME: One hour
Scene 1 – before the curtain
Meshach and Jasmine enter from opposite sides and meet down center
JASMINE: (excited) Hey, Meshach. We’re here.
MESHACH: (stunned) Is that you, Jasmine?
JASMINE: Yes, it’s me silly. Who else would it be?
MESHACH: You’re so…. Grown up.
JASMINE: You haven’t seen me since I was eleven. Not only have I grown up, I can read and write in three
languages, handle a mount and I learned to swim.
MESHACH: Girls don’t swim.
JASMINE: Girls don’t have any fun. Grandfather’s eyes have gotten weaker so he pretty much had to teach me
to read and write, but the swimming and riding were all my ideas.
MESHACH: Oh oh. Your ideas used to get us in quite a bit of trouble.
JASMINE: Only when we got caught. I hardly ever get caught doing (changing her voice to adult male) those
hare brained schemes (changes voice back to normal) anymore. Besides, I have made a decision about my life.
Girls typically have boring lives, cooking, cleaning, changing diapers; the same thing day after day so I’ve
decided I’m going to be different. I’m going to go on adventures.
MESHACH: Shouldn’t you be wearing a veil?
JASMINE: Aren’t you listening to anything I’m saying?
MESHACH: Girls of marriageable age all wear veils.
JASMINE: (laughing) I see that hasn’t changed – you being so proper.
MESHACH: (stumbling around what he wants to say) Well, you should be now that you’re.. a … lady. Women
are supposed to be veiled when they are among outsiders.
JASMINE: You are hardly an outsider. We practically grew up together. We learned to read and write, do
sums and geometry and chart the stars side by side. Why you had to move to Shushan I’ll never know.

MESHACH: Father was appointed governor.
JASMINE: Yeah, I guess that’s a good reason. Anyway – isn’t all this talk of the promised king being born
exciting? I’ve been helping my grandfather go through the scrolls Daniel left. (sadly) He can’t see to read
anymore so I’m his eyes. (getting an edge of excitement in her voice) We think this could be the star. What do
you think?
MESHACH: I don’t know. First of all, the Jews are subject to the Romans so it doesn’t seem logical for their
greatest king to be born now.
JASMINE: He’s supposed to free his people, isn’t he?
MESHACH: I don’t think they mean literally free his people. Anyway, they aren’t technically slaves, they’re
just conquered. Secondly, there is already a king – Herod is his name. My father says he is not expecting a
child. Probably a good thing to because he’s had one or two sons executed. Father says he’s jealous for his
throne.
JASMINE: You are still pessimistic, I see. I think this may be it. Grandfather says the timing is right – the
exact number of years that Daniel prophesied have passed. It is time for the Messiah to be born.
MESHACH: That is true. (JASMINE interrupts)
JASMINE: Look, we have a problem. I want to go along but grandfather won’t let me. I almost didn’t get to
come this far but I convinced him he should leave me here with your mother and sisters. I am determined to
go. If this is the king we have been waiting for, for 100’s of years, I want to be there to see it myself. Besides,
grandfather needs my eyes.
MESHACH: (shocked) It’s too dangerous. My father almost decided not to take me and I’m male. He’s afraid
our caravan will get attacked because we carry such expensive gifts for the king. I’m supposed to be helping
come up with a plan to avoid trouble.
JASMINE: Who is afraid of a few desert raider? We have skilled guards and I can handle a mount as well as
any of them.
MESHACH: But you’re a girl, er woman,,, oh you know what I mean. Girls don’t go on trips like these.
Women stay home and take care of their husbands and children. Men go on dangerous adventures.
JASMINE: I have no husband or children. Nor do I ever intend to have them. I’m going to be a scholar and
traveler. Now about this trip -I’m going. I’ll just need you to help me with my plan.
MESHACH: Plan? You mean another one of your hare-brained schemes, don’t you. Last time I helped with
one of your plans I almost got… (JASMINE interrupts)
JASMINE: Don’t be silly. This time we won’t get caught. It’s a fabulous plan. Suki, who takes care of the
camels, is just my size. Grandfather plans to take him along to tend the camels. And he’s always got his face
covered up because of that scar he has. I plan to switch places with him. No one will know. I just need you to
find some excuse and get him to trade clothes with you.

MESHACH: That’s crazy. No one is going to believe you’re Suki.
JASMINE: They will. At least long enough for me to come along. But you also need to send him on a fool’s
errand the day we leave so he’s not around.
MESHACH: You don’t know the first thing about taking care of camels. Besides, it’s hard work and the trip
will be grueling. Father says the journey to Judea could take five or six months.
JASMINE: If I can learn the Greek alphabet, how hard can taking care of camels be? If you’re so concerned
about the camels, you can help me. Shhhh. Here comes Suki now.
SUKI: (entering and bowing) The others have arrived. Your grandfather wishes you to come assist him with
reading.
JASMINE: (dismissively) Tell him I will be right there.
SUKI: (uncomfortable about insisting) I am to escort you.
JASMINE: I’ll be right behind you. (motioning to MESHACH) We have something private to discuss. It will
just take a sec. Walk slow and I’ll catch you before you’re half way there. (SUKI seems uncomfortable and
unsure)
MESHACH: I’ll make sure she comes. I’ll walk with her. Go on ahead. (SUKI nods “ok” and exits)
JASMINE: You’re good. I knew I could count on you to help me.
MESHACH: I am NOT going to help you. If your grandfather has forbidden it, then you must do as he says.
JASMINE: (hands on hips) Meshach, my grandfather is an old man. This trip could be the death of him. He
needs me. I know he’s just trying to protect me by leaving me here but I want to be there in case… you know.
MESHACH: (conflicted and undecided) I don’t know…
JASMINE: But I do. So it’s settled. (lights down)

Scene 2 – Interior of Melchoir’s
At rise: Magi and Azariah are examining scrolls, maps and star charts while discussing their findings.
BALTHASAR: According to the prophet Jeremiah, (reads)
The days are coming," declares the LORD,
"when I will raise up to David a righteous Branch,
a King who will reign wisely
and do what is just and right in the land.

In his days Judah will be saved
and Israel will live in safety.
This is the name by which he will be called:
The LORD Our Righteousness.
We know Herod is not that king. He does not rule wisely. He assassinates any and all who threaten his throne.
MELCHOIR: It could be just a comet we all observed.
BALTHASAR: Or even a planet, undiscovered until now. (Jasmine, Suki and MESHACH enter)
JASPER: But I think it is a star. And not just any star. It could be THE star. Jasmine, find the passage we
talked about. (JASMINE TAKES THE SCROLL JASPER hands her and begins looking for the passage)
MELCHOIR: If this is the time, then the Romans have to be the clay feet. The Romans don’t seem like clay to
me. (JASMINE nods that she has the passage)
JASPER: Read it aloud for us, Jasmine.
JASMINE: I see him, but not now;
I behold him, but not near.
A star will come out of Jacob;
a scepter will rise out of Israel.
JASPER: His coming will be proceeded by a star.
MELCHOIR: We have to be sure. We have been entrusted with a legacy.
JASPER: Yes, we have been. Since the time of my ancestor Daniel, we magi who descended from Daniel,
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego have been waiting for the fulfillment of this prophesy to our forefathers. We
stayed behind, when others returned to the land of Judah so they we could keep track of the signs, the scrolls
and look for the star.
MELCHOIR: And for generations we have watched the night sky for the signs of the Messiah’s arrival.
BALTHASAR: We have passed the information and the responsibility from father to son all these years.
JASPER: I have been watching the longest of all three of us. I say this is the sign, the star.
BALTHASAR: (starting to consider the possibility) I must admit, the timing is right when Daniel prophesied it
would be.
MELCHOIR: Let us not be hasty. I propose we study this star for three nights, and review all the prophesies for
three days. If in three days time, two of the three of us are convinced, I will agree to go and take the gifts that
our families have saved and added to all these centuries.
JASPER: Sensible. What do you think, Balthasar? Can you agree to this proposal?

BALTHASAR: The Romans are taking a census in Israel. It will be a time of political unrest, short tempers,
crowds and danger.
MELCHOIR: Already bandits and thieves are taking advantage of those traveling to their home cities to be
counted.
JASPER: But if this is the moment we have waited for, for centuries, then we must act.
BALTHASAR: Three days and nights of study. If two of us three agree it is time, then we go.
MELCHOIR: Agreed. (All three men clasp hands. JASMINE and MESHACH exchange glances)

Scene 3- in front of curtain
JASMINE: Why did Balthasar and your father oppose my grandfather’s idea?
MESHACH: My father is afraid that perhaps your grandfather’s judgment is clouded by his age.
JASMINE: (defensively)What do you mean? That’s he’s getting senile? Just because he’s losing his sight
doesn’t mean he’s losing his mind.
MESHACH: It’s not that. My father feels that your grandfather may be reading more than there is into the
signs because he wants so badly for the King to be born in his lifetime. (unsure of how to broach such a delicate
topic) He is quite old. Much longer and he absolutely would not be able to make the trip. I mean, he might …
you know… with the journey being so long and dangerous…
JASMINE: He might die. There. I said it for you. (letting down her guard) I have considered that too. In fact,
he keeps talking about getting me settled into a home before it is too late.
MESHACH: He just wants what is best for you.
JASMINE: Marrying some old geezer as old as my grandfather won’t help matters. They might die off first.
MESHACH: (reasoning with her) He isn’t going to marry you to some ancient…. (asking) is he?
JASMINE: (almost outraged) I’ve seen the letters of proposal. I have to read them to grandfather, remember? I
know who is asking for a match.
MESHACH: (with pity and shock) And they are that old?
JASMINE: (less outraged) Well, one of them was forty something I think. But he has kids my age. I don’t
want to marry some widower even if he is one of the richest merchants in Persia. But even the ones that aren’t
old in age have old minds – stuck in tradition. I want more than tradition in life. I want adventure.
MESHACH: But this adventure, it’s just not a good idea. Think of your grandfather. The last thing he needs is
to worry about you.
JASMINE: He won’t be worried if he doesn’t know I’m along. Listen, it is bad enough Shadrach’s line died out
and there are only our three families left. My father was an only child and I am the last one of my family’s line.
When he died I became the only one to carry on the work.
MESHACH: (trying to convince her) Until you marry and have children. It is your duty to stay safe and have
children who can carry on the work..
JASMINE: (stubborn) No, it is my duty to go to take care of my grandfather and should that fail, then to be
witness of the promised king’s arrival as the last surviving member of the household of Daniel the prophet.
MESHACH: There’s no talking you out of this crazy plan, is there?

JASMINE: (smiling and satisfied she has finally worn him down) None whatsoever.
MESHACH: I can’t believe I am going to help you. If I get in trouble…
JASMINE: You won’t. I’ll take all the blame. I won’t mention your assistance. (over dramatically) even if
they beat me. My lips are sealed.
MESHACH: I’ll give Suki his “disguise” and send him to the marketplace. But that is all I can do to help you.
JASMINE: I will do the rest. (hugs him spontaneously) Thanks. You won’t regret this. (she exits)
MESHACH: I already do.

Scene 4 – Herod’s palace
At rise: HEROD on throne surrounded by courtiers.
CHIEF COURTIER: Your highness, a decree sent by Caesar Augustus.
HEROD: Read it to us.
CHIEF COURTIER: (reading) I, Caesar Augustus, decree that a census should be taken of the entire Roman
world. Everyone is to go to his own town to register. Please provide whatever assistance is needed by my
Roman officials. (looking up) It is signed and sealed by the emperor.
HEROD: (irritated) A census is the first step towards more taxes. I already brought Augustus 700 talents of
silver. Now I can look forward to more taxes. As if we don’t have enough troubles already. (Getting up to
pace) The Jews don’t accept me. My own family conspires against me. And now a census.
CHIEF COURTIER: My Lord, you have taken care of your problems, have you not, with the deaths of the
traitors?
HEROD: I have dealt with some of the traitors. My wife, Mariamme and her miserable, ambitious sons are
dead.
CHIEF COURTIER: As well as her grandfather and her brother, the High Priest.
HEROD: And I will execute more if I have to. I have earned this throne a thousand times over and no one, no
one will take it from me. No one. (Settling back down on his throne) Give the Romans whatever assistance they
need to get this census over with.

Scene 5 – before the curtain
MESHACH and JASMINE approach each other from opposite sides. They are careful and cautious, quiet and
stealthy. MESHACH thrusts first one, then another bundle into JASMINE’S hands.
MESHACH: Here are Suki’s clothes. But put them in a saddle bag for later and wear these now.
JASMINE: (unwrapping the second bundle) These are beggar clothes?!
MESHACH: It’s part of the plan. We’re traveling as lepers who are making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.
JASMINE: Why?
MESHACH: Who’s going to come near a beggar?

JASMINE: That is brilliant. No one will rob us, or even come close for fear of catching leprosy.
MESHACH: (proudly) I came up with the plan. And since lepers cover their mouths, sometimes their whole
face, you’ll be able to hide your identity even more easily.
JASMINE: (genuinely impressed) I’m impressed with your plan.
MESHACH: (modesty) I kind of got the idea from you going in disguise. I thought if you can, we all could.
JASMINE: You’re too modest. I’ll change and start loading the camels.

Months later
Scene 6a
At rise: Before curtain. MESHACH is pacing, agitated. Jasmine is seated, combing out her hair.
MESHACH: (miserable) I can’t believe you gave yourself away. For three months we had everyone fooled.
Three months! My father will probably kill me for being involved. How could we keep this a secret for three
months and then just like that…. (pause) He’s going to kill me.
JASMINE: (matter-of-factly, unperturbed) I don’t think he’ll kill you. You are his only son. (trying to be
funny) He’ll probably just beat you within an inch of your life. (MESHACH stops long enough to glare at her)
I’m kidding. We’re more than half way there so they can’t possibly send us back. It has taken us three months
to get this far. It won’t be a big deal.
MESHACH: Every time I let you talk me into some harebrained scheme, I get in trouble. You – you never get
more than a reprimand. But me… He’s going to kill me…(AZARIAH enters)
AZARIAH: (Stiff and formal) They will see you now. (JASMINE rises and they begin to go) (Lightening up)
Meshach, how could you be so dumb? She has been getting you in trouble since we were five. Haven’t you
grown up at least? (JASMINE glares at him, hands on hips) I thought would have known better than get
involved in something like this. I thought you had become a scholar and had a keen intellect. (JASMINE glares
at him again and flounces off., AZARIAH watches then turns back to MESHACH. Suddenly he understands and
smiles) You’re in love with her. That’s why you do all these crazy things. (MESHACH starts to deny it, gives
up and turns and exits) You must really want your heart broken. She will never settle down. (AZARIAH exits
shaking his head)
Scene 6b

(Curtain opens. Desert oasis. JASPER is seated center stage. BALTHASAR and MELCHOIR are seated on
either side of him. )
JASPER: I apologize. How could I have been duped so? And for three months.

MELCHOIR: Do not castigate yourself. Your eyes are failing. But mine are fine. (upset with himself) Too
think my own son went along with this. (to BALTHASAR) At least yours wasn’t involved.
BALTHASAR: I’m not so sure. But if he wasn’t, how could he have been so oblivious for three months. Either
way – he is in trouble.
JASPER: And my granddaughter Jasmine has caused this trouble.
MELCHOIR: Just when I thought my son was growing into manhood!
BALTHASAR: That’s exactly the problem. He’s becoming a man and has noticed that Jasmine has become a
woman. And not just any woman. A very beautiful woman.
JASPER: Her mother was striking.
BALTHASAR: Even Solomon, the wisest of all kings, blessed by the Almighty with wisdom beyond any
known to mortal man, this Solomon was led astray by women.
JASPER: True, his foreign wives led him astray.
BALTHASAR: And even Samson, the man blessed by God with unnatural strength, Samson was undone by a
woman.
MELCHOIR: Delilah, yes. Delilah was his undoing.
JASPER: (cutting him off with a smallest amount of edge in his voice) I’m not so sure I want my granddaughter
compared to Delilah. She is a good girl. Misguided perhaps at times. This is my fault for not providing her
with a proper home when he parents died.
MELCHOIR: Don’t chastise yourself. You have done a wonderful job being both mother and father to an
orphan.
BALTHASAR: Even Mordecai could not have done a better job
MELCHOIR: Jasmine is a remarkable young woman. She is pleasing in form, has a quick mind, and if you
don’t mind me saying so, has done the work of two men keeping the camels.
JASPER: (sighing) Nevertheless, this deception is serious.
BALTHASAR: Serious.
MELCHOIR: A serious distraction of the highest magnitude for my Meshach.
JASPER: And I am not getting any younger. What will happen to Jasmine when I die?
BALTHASAR: She should be married off as quickly as possible. Having a husband and children will settle her
down.
JASPER: Yes, and break her heart. She yearns for adventure.

MELCHOIR: I think I have a solution. But the young ones are coming. Let us talk more later after we have
spoken to them.
AZARIAH sits by BALTHASAR. JASMINE and MESHACH stand before the elders. They are humble and
contrite.
JASPER: Jasmine, would it be within my power, I would send you back in chains. But we travel light and no
one can be spared to escort you. (heavy sigh) I should have sent you to live with a family with a mother when
your parents died. It is my fault you have grown up so unruly and headstrong. I am disappointed.
JASMINE: (sincerely) I am sorry, grandfather. It was never my intention to hurt you. I just wanted to make sure
you were alright. You are all I have in this world.
JASPER: I know. But this hare-brained scheme of yours must be punished.
MELCHOIR: Meshach, there is no excuse for your lapse of judgment. You were brought up in a good family.
Your mother will die of embarrassment when she hears. For your part in this escapade, there will be a time of
reckoning, but first we must finish what we set out to do: follow the star and find the king. Then I shall deal
with you.
BALTHASAR: Azariah, I find it most difficult to believe you had absolutely no knowledge of any of this.
Therefore, when the journey is over, you too will be suitably punished. (AZARIAH is caught completely off
guard and moves his mouth to defend himself but nothing comes out. He looks bewildered, then scowls at
JASMINE and MESHACH)
MELCHOIR: Meshach, for the remainder of this trip, I will seriously be considering whether or not you will
continue in your studies. If you cannot guide your own conduct, how can you conduct affairs of state. See to it
there are no more of these hare brained schemes. Do you understand?
MESHACH: Yes, sir.
BALTHASAR: Let nothing else sidetrack us from this mission of most epic importance.
AZARIAH: Yes, father.
JASPER: We old ones need our rest. This desert is not getting any easier to traverse. Jasmine, you will have to
remain disguised as a boy. Water the camels then get your rest. (As everyone gets out bedrolls and prepares to
bed down, MESHACH catches JASMINE’S eye and signals she is to behave and not get in anymore trouble.
JASMINE holds her palms out flat indicating she is innocent of any trouble and nods “OK”. Lights down)

Scene 7 before the curtain
The Magi entourage is stopped and looking ahead.

AZARIAH: Traffic has certainly picked up around Jerusalem.
BALSHAZAR: The Romans are definitely making their presence known. Azariah, it is time for you to lead the
next segment of this journey. You and two of the servants are to change into your regular robes and venture
into the city ahead of us. Go to the palace. Deliver a message to King Herod’s palace that three Magi from the
east, governors of the Persians, will be arriving soon and humbly ask for an audience with his highness. Present
him with the gift.
AZARIAH: What if he will not see us? Then what should I do?
BALTHASAR: We must see him, therefore failure is not an option. Understood?
AZARIAH: Yes, father. (Exits with two servants)
JASPER: Jasmine, you must stay close to me the entire time, disguised as a servant lad
JASMINE: Yes, grandfather.
JASPER: Do not speak for any reason.
JASMINE: I will a mute, unable to speak. (Lights down)
Curtain opens
At rise: HEROD on throne surrounded by courtiers. Courtier blows trumpet. Magi, followed by JASMINE,
MESHACH and AZARIAH enter and bow before King Herod.
HEROD: Welcome to Jerusalem. I am honored to have three distinguished Persian governor’s grace my palace.
What brings you all the way from Persia to Judea?
BALTHASAR: We come to worship the Messiah.
JASPER: We are scholars of Jewish history as well as Viziers to our king. Each of us trace our ancestry back
to one of the children of Israel taken into captivity by Nebuchadnezzar. I am descended from Daniel, the
prophet.
MELCHOIR: I m a descendant of Meshach, known by the Jewish name of Mishael.
BALTHASAR: And I trace my lineage back to Abednego, known also as Azariah.
HEROD: And where is the one who represents the house of Shadrach?
MELCHOIR: Unfortunately, Shadrach’s line died out some 100 years ago.
JASPER: We have traveled here in search of the fulfillment of prophesy. Where is the one who has been born
king of the Jews?
BALTHASAR: We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.

HEROD: (suspicious, a bit angry) King? What king? I am the only king of the Jews. (COURTIER whispers in
HEROD’s ear) (confused) The king of prophesy? (more whispering) (pleasantly but fake) I understand. The
king of the prophesy. Let me consult with the chief priests and teachers of the law. I will send for you when I
have the information you seek. (Magi and entourage bow and exit)
HEROD: (angry and forceful) You find out where this rival king has been born. I will not have anyone
challenging me for the throne. I want to know yesterday where this threat is.
CHIEF COURTIER: At once, your highness. (Lights out)

Scene 8 before curtain
JASMINE and MESHACH are sitting, gazing up at the stars.
MESHACH: (pointing) It hasn’t moved.
JASMINE: It is almost as if the star is waiting for us to follow it.
MESHACH: Yeah. Kind of like when the children of Israel followed the pillar of fire by night.
JASMINE: Our God leads in mysterious ways. I wonder why?
MESHACH: We all wonder. But his mind to ours is like our mind to that of a grasshopper. (Beat)
JASMINE: Herod didn’t take the news well.
MESHACH: As father and the others suspected.
JASMINE: Do you think he’ll call us back? Give us any information?
MESHACH: I would guess that he will. He’ll want to know what we know if he thinks there is a rival king out
there. He already doesn’t trust the Jews. And they don’t trust him.
JASMINE: Why?
MESHACH: Several reasons. One, he’s an Arab.
JASMINE: How did he get to be king?
MESHACH: Politics. His father was on a first name basis with Julius Caesar. He was appointed king and
married a Jewish princes named Mariamme, hoping that would gain him acceptance.
JASMINE: But it didn’t?

MESHACH: No. The Jews don’t like him, even though he is rebuilding the temple. They don’t trust him. I
don’t blame them. He killed Queen Mariamme as well as her two sons, grandfather and her brother.
JASMINE: Killed them? Why?
MESHACH: Father says he’s easily threatened into doing rash things.
JASMINE: What a barbarian. (beat) That’s just it. Women are just pawns in the games men play. I never want
to be a pawn, pushed around, treated like I am of no consequence. At least I don’t have much family to kill off.
MESHACH: I don’t think you have anything to worry about, Jasmine. The man who tried to push you around
would get pushed back.
JASMINE: (sighing) Yeah, But what kind of life would that be, locked in a power struggle until you died?
is best just to avoid marriage. (Lights out)

scene 9
At rise: HEROD on throne surrounded by courtiers. PRIEST carrying a scroll, enters and bows before King
Herod.
HEROD: (sternly) Where will the Christ be born? Is there a prophesy of this?
PRIEST: Yes, your majesty. Shall I read it to you? (HEROD waves permission to read)
In Bethlehem in Judea, for this is what the prophet has written:
But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;
for out of you will come a ruler
who will be the shepherd of my people Israel.
HEROD: (paranoid and growing angry at the thought of a rival) When was he born? How long ago?
PRIEST: We know not, oh king.
HEROD: (to courtier) Call back those Magi, but have them come secretly. I will not have the masses thinking
there is some Messiah out there. They’d do foolish things and get Rome angry.
CHIEF COURTIER: Yes, your highness. (exits)
PRIEST: Your highness?
HEROD: (crossly) What is it?

PRIEST: A few months back something unusual took place. In light of this development I think you should
know.
HEROD: (sitting up and leaning toward the priest with interest and furrowed brow) Go on.
PRIEST: One of the oldest priests, a Zechariah, had a vision in the temple that left him mute. He apparently had
been visited by an angel that prophesied he’d have a son in his old age. When his time of service was up, he
returned home.
HEROD: Go on?
PRIEST: His wife, Elizabeth was well advanced in years and was barren. But about five months later we heard
she was going to have a child.
HEROD: Was she as old as Sarah when she had Isaac?
PRIEST: I don’t think she was 90, but they were both very old. In due time she had a son and when they tried
to name him for his father, Elizabeth insisted his name was to be John. Signing to us, Zechariah agreed he was
to be named John, rather than Zechariah. At that very instance, the man’s tongue was loosed and he praised
God.
CHIEF COURTIER: I remember the incident. The neighbors were all filled with awe, and throughout the hill
country of Judea people were talking about all these things.
PRIEST: Everyone who heard this wondered about it, asking, "What then is this child going to be?"
CHIEF COURTIER: His father declared he should be a Nazarene and would go on before the Lord, in the
spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of
the righteous—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.
PRIEST: At the time, most of us dismissed this as an old man’s fancy. But now?
HEROD: Superstition. Ignorant people see signs everywhere. (sternly) But I should have been informed.
PRIEST: But that is not all. The old man prophesied. I may not have it word for word but it went something
like this: (reciting) Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,
because he has come and has redeemed his people.
He has raised up a horn of salvation for us
in the house of his servant David
(Pause as he switches back to conversational tone) Then he raised the child high into the air and said:
(Reciting)
And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High;
for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him.
HEROD: (Irate) And you are telling me this now?! I should have been told immediately if there was any talk
of someone preparing the way for another king. What is that prophesy – the one for which Jews set an extra
plate for Elijah on the Passover? Do you have a copy of that?

PRIEST: I will fetch the scroll at once. (Exits)
HEROD: (Ranting and pacing, shaking his finger at courtiers) Conspiracies to my left and right. As if having
the Romans marching all over my land was not enough, now I have a revolt in the works. I will put an end
to….
CHIEF COURTIER: (entering and clearing his throat)Your highness, the Magi from the east.
HEROD: (stops short, composes himself then returns to his throne He speaks with a calm authoritative voice.)
Show them in. (COURTIER waves them in. The Magi, followed by JASMINE, MESHACH and AZARIAH enter
and bow before King Herod. PRIEST reenters carrying a second scroll)
HEROD: (with fake cordiality and pleasantness) Welcome once again. I hope we can help each other. Exactly
when did this star appear?
JASPER: Although we cannot be exactly sure when it appeared, all three of us sited it for the first time about
four and one half months ago.
MELCHOIR: We study the sky every night. We believe we noticed it immediately since it is of unusual
brightness and since it appears to move.
BALTHASAR: I thought perhaps it was a comet or another planet at first. But we are convinced that this is the
star spoken of in the holy scriptures in the book of Numbers. Shall we read it to you?
HEROD nods and BALTHASAR indicates AZARIAH should read.
AZARIAH: I see him, but not now;
I behold him, but not near.
A star will come out of Jacob;
a scepter will rise out of Israel.
HEROD: Yes. This must be the star. My scholars say the child will be born in Bethlehem. (nods to priest)
PRIEST 1: From the prophet Micah,
But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,
though you are small among the clans of Judah,
out of you will come for me
one who will be ruler over Israel,
whose origins are from of old,
from ancient times.
He will stand and shepherd his flock
in the strength of the LORD,
in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God.
And they will live securely, for then his greatness
will reach to the ends of the earth.

HEROD: Go and make a careful search for the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may
go and worship him.
JASPER: As you wish.
MELCHOIR: Please accept a small token of our gratitude for seeing us. (MESHACH comes forward with a gift
and bowing low, presents it to HEROD. Herod picks it up, obviously delighted)
HEROD: You are welcome. (HEROD dismisses them with a wave of his hand. Magi entourage bows once
more and exits)
HEROD: I want them followed. But not so closely they discover they are being followed. I want to know the
location of this rival king so I can eliminate the pretender before he causes me any trouble.
CHIEF COURTIER: Yes, your majesty. (exits)
HEROD: Now, about that other prophesy…
PRIEST: I have it here. (Unrolls second scroll). From Malachi
See, I will send my messenger, who will prepare the way before me. Then suddenly the Lord you are seeking
will come to his temple; the messenger of the covenant, whom you desire, will come," says the LORD
Almighty.
But who can endure the day of his coming? Who can stand when he appears? For he will be like a refiner's fire
or a launderer's soap.
See, I will send you the prophet Elijah before that great and dreadful day of the LORD comes. He will turn the
hearts of the fathers to their children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers; or else I will come and strike
the land with a curse.
HEROD: Enough! From now on I want to know about anything – anything unusual that goes on in or around
the temple. Do you understand?
PRIEST: Absolutely your highness.
HEROD: And find out what you can about the old couple and that baby. Where are they now? They could be
the start of a rebellion. (PRIEST nods, bows and exits, lights down, curtain)

Scene 10 – before the curtain left
The Magi entourage is packing up.
BALTHASAR: I have a bad feeling about giving that information to Herod.
JASPER: As do I. His words were gracious but his tone was threatening.

MELCHOIR: Herod has executed members of his own family that he feared might usurp his throne.
BALTHASAR: Then let us be on our guard. He may have us followed.
MESHACH: So we go back to our disguises?
BALTHASAR: No, not yet. He knows we are going to Bethlehem. Let us do so openly. Let us make it easy to
be followed, at first.
Scene 11 – before curtain right
COURTIER and SPY are lying on ground, looking forward. They give the impression they are spying on
someone while wishing to remain out of sight.
CHIEF COURTIER: That’s them alright. Kind of hard to miss the red cloaks.
SPY: Do you think their story of a king has any truth to it?
CHIEF COURTIER: It doesn’t matter what we think, only what Herod thinks. Keep them in our sights.

ACT 2
Scene 12 – before curtain left, desert overlooking Bethlehem
BALTHASAR is looking through a telescope type instrument. MESHACK is on the ground looking behind them.
BALTHASAR: (pointing above) The star has stopped over that house. (Ad lib overjoyed comments on finally
reaching their destination)
MELCHOIR: Are we still being tracked?
MESHACH: (rising) Yes. The same two men continue to stop when we stop and go when we go.
JASPER: Then we cannot go directly to the house. It would endanger them. We will find a secluded place and
covertly change back into our beggar outfits and go undetected. I do not trust Herod and I do not wish him to
know the location of this promised child.
BALTHASAR: I think it is time to put our second plan into motion.
JASPER: I agree.
MELCHOIR: We will need a diversion. Meshach, you and the servants will continue on. Hire five men to
dress as your servants while the three of you don the extra Magi robes and appear to be we Magi. You will rent

rooms, you will attract attention. The next day, you will go in the opposite direction on some fool’s errand. To
keep those spies following you.
JASPER: That will give us time to find the child and present our gifts.
MESHACH: (greatly disappointed and upset) But when will I get to see the child!
MELCHOIR: I am afraid that you will not.
MESHACH: (stunned) But I have come all this way… I.
MELCHOIR: (beginning before MESHACH can protest further) Your role is crucial. Do you spurn to do this
to ensure the safety of this child? (MESHACH shakes his head “no”) Besides, this is part of the consequences
for your complicity with Jasmine.
JASMINE: Then I too should not be allowed to go. (MESHACH looks up quickly, not believing she is
volunteering to be left out)
JASPER: (with uncharacteristic sharpness) Young lady, you will not venture out of my sight. Do you
understand?
JASMINE: (Cowed for once, humbly) Yes, grandfather.
MESHACH: (greatly disappointed but resigned to do his part) I understand, father. I will do this. I will draw
Herod’s spies away from the child.
MELCHOIR: Good.
BALSHAZAR: Do not expect us to rejoin you for at least a day, possibly two
MELCHOIR: Then let us all do what we need to do. (placing his hands on his shoulders) Do not fail us or the
young king. (MESHACH bows in submission)

Scene 13 – Zechariah’s house
At rise: MARY is rocking the baby Jesus and sitting next to ELIZABETH who is rocking John. JOSEPH is
talking to ZECHARIAH. Both are standing, examining a basket. There is a knock on the door. ZECHARIAH
answers it and brings in the MAGI ENTOURAGE. They enter and bow to ZECHARIAH.
ZECHARIAH: Shalom. I am the priest Zechariah; this is my wife Elizabeth and our relatives Mary and Joseph.
How can I help you?
BALTHASAR: We are scholars of the sky called Magi, from the east.

JASPER: Although we serve in the Persian government, we are Jews and the descendents of Jews.
BALTHASAR: We followed the star and it rested upon this house.
MELCHOIR: We seek the child who is born both king and Messiah. Long have we studied the sky and the
scrolls and for generations our ancestors anticipated this day’s arrival.
MELCHOIR: We have looked for this promised child’s birth since we were old enough to see the stars. Not
only us but our forefathers before us.
JASPER: I trace my lineage to Daniel, one of the Hebrew children who served in Nebuchadnezzar’s court.
ZECHARIAH: The Daniel that was thrown into the lion’s den?
JASPER: Yes, and this is my only heir, my granddaughter Jasmine. (JASMINE bows)
BALTHASAR: I trace my lineage back to Abednego. I named my son after him, but with the Hebrew version
of the name – Azariah. (AZARIAH bows)
MELCHOIR: And I am a descendant of Meshach, known also as Mishael in the Hebrew tongue. I named my
son, Meshach, after him. He regrets he could not be here.
ZECHARIAH: Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego? The three men who were thrown into the fiery furnace
because they refused to worship Nebuchadnezzar’s golden image? (MAGI nod “yes”) Your ancestors are
heroes of old. But where is Shadrach’s offspring?
MELCHOIR: Alas, his line died out many years ago during an earthquake.
JASPER: Since the prophesy of the Messiah King was given to Daniel, we have been charged with watching
the skies and collecting the prophesies of the coming of this king. For generations we have watched and waited.
Today it seems everything has come to pass. We followed the star to you here. (beat) But we see two babies.
ZECHARIAH: This is my son John, chosen by God to be the forerunner of the Christ.
JOSEPH: This is Jesus. The promised child, the hope and reconciliation of Israel.
Entourage falls to their knees before Jesus.
JASPER: (raising his face to heaven) We thank and praise you, Oh God for giving us this opportunity to
worship your son, the king, God come in the form of mankind.
The Magi entourage ad libs phrases like “we praise you”, “Thank you, lord”, “Hallelujah”, etc. The
entourage removes their outer garments to reveal their elegant and regal robes. (AZARIAH, JASMINE,
MESHACH assist the elders before removing their own disguises) Joseph places a basket at Mary’s feet and
Mary places Jesus in the basket.
The Magi’s simple head pieces are removed (others can help) to reveal crowns upon JASPER, MELCHOIR,
and BALTHASAR. They remove their crowns and lay them before Jesus.

JASPER: Lord God, enthroned on the heavens above, I thank you for blessing us with the opportunity to
worship both you and this child. (Entourage stands)
BALTHASAR: Our forefathers rose to high positions in the governments of the Babylonians, Medes and
Persians. In every generation, part of their wealth that God had blessed them with was set aside to be presented
to the king. Please accept these humble gifts. Azariah.
AZARIAH: I present to you Myrrh as an anointing oil. For this child shall be a healer of wounds both physical
and spiritual and an anointed priest, after the order of Melchizadek.
JASPER: I present to you gold as one would offer a king. This child is destined to become king of kings and
lord of lords. And he shall reign forever and ever in an eternal kingdom. (He hands bags to Jasmine who
presents them)
MELCHOIR: I present to you frankincense, an aromatic incense presented before God. For this child is God
come in the flesh, the son of God who has come to save all mankind.
MAGI entourage joins together to sing a song of praise. See production notes for suggestions
JOSEPH: We thank you. (Mary picks up Jesus and holds him)
MELCHOIR: We rejoice with you for we have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from
the Father, full of grace and truth.
BALTHASAR: We would speak further with the two of you. (indicating Joseph and Zechariah) Come outside
where we can see the stars. (All but the women exit)
ELIZABETH: You have had a long journey. Would you like some refreshment?
JASMINE: No, thank you.
MARY: How long did you travel?
JASMINE: A bit more than five months.
ELIZABETH: (to Mary) Can you imagine?
MARY: Yes, I can. A few days, when you are about to give birth seems like nine months. (They laugh
together)
ELIZABETH: I am surprised to find a young lady traveling such a long distance in dangerous times.
MARY: Are you betrothed to one of the young men? That’s why I had to travel.
JASMINE: No, I’m not betrothed. I just wanted to come. And to take care of my grandfather. (Small
outburst) Why shouldn’t girls have adventures too? Who wants to be some plain old wife and mother? (covers
mouth in embarrassment over what she had said to “plain old wives and mothers”) Forgive me. I was rude.
ELIZABETH: We are not offended. I am thrilled to finally, after years and years of trying, to be a mother.

JASMINE: (pointing to JOHN) This is your baby? Your first baby?
ELIZABETH: (with obvious pride and contentment) Yes. Jasmine, I was barren until a few months ago. It was
a terrible burden to bear. I longed to have a child for years. Someday you too may understand the deep desire
to have and care for a child of your own.
MARY: I can think of no greater adventure than being a mother. The trip here was certainly not easy. Imagine
being ready to deliver a baby while riding a donkey for 15 miles a day. But for the sake of this child, I would
have gone any distance.
JASMINE: I guess traveling while pregnant would be difficult.
MARY: Not only that – we got here and the inn was full.
ELIZABETH: They had no idea we were staying here in this house in Bethlehem or they could have come here.
MARY: So we had to stay in a cave that had been converted into a stable. That’s where Joseph delivered the
baby. We wrapped Jesus in swaddling clothes and laid him in the cattle’s feeding trough for a cradle.
JASMINE: Sounds like you made the best of a bad situation.
ELIZABETH: You don’t know the half of it.
MARY: When the angel fist brought me the news I was troubled. I was betrothed to a good man, yet God had
called me to carry his own child, God come in the flesh. I wondered what Joseph would think. What he would
do.
ELIZABETH: Do you know what the penalty for adultery is in Israel?
JASMINE: A fine?
MARY: Death by stoning. Joseph could have brought me before the elders and insisted I be put to death.
JASMINE: How did you talk him out of it?
MARY: I didn’t. God did. Despite the gossip, the snide remarks, the humiliation, Joseph stood by me. (MARY
starts tearing up. Elizabeth reaches and arm around her to side hug and support her) I have been doubly
blessed.
ELIZABETH: As I have. Never did Zechariah rebuke me for being barren. Instead he comforted me as together
we faced this great disappointment. Looking back, we both see why God did not answer our prayers for a child
sooner. This child (indicating John) is destined for an enormous task. Many people know what a miracle his
birth was and eagerly await his purpose in the kingdom of God..
MARY: I wondered but I was not afraid. The angel Gabriel said I would be with child and give birth to a son
named Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the
throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end. It was
God’s word. It would come true which meant I would live to deliver the child.

JASMINE: Perhaps being the mother of a king would be OK.
MARY: It is not about being the mother of a king. It is about being the servant of the Lord, willing to do
whatever task he asks of you. No matter how great or how small. You are descended from Daniel. Do you
believe that?
JASMINE: Not entirely. But I certainly will reflect on it.
ELIZABETH: It is just a matter of keeping an open mind and using open eyes. I never imagined I’d be a
mother at my age. But I am and not just of an ordinary child. My son John will be the forerunner of the
(pointing to Jesus) Messiah. I can think of no more noble or exciting task that to nurture, teach and care for my
son who will play such an important role in the salvation of the world. It is not about me. It is all about Him.
JASMINE: I never thought about motherhood like that.
MARY: Be humble. Open yourself to be the servant of God most high and whatever He wants for you. No
matter how educated you are: God is wiser. Let Him guide you. Be his servant first and all the rest will come to
you.
ELIZABETH: I wish I had known my mother.
MARY: What happened?
JASMINE: My parents died just after I was born during an earthquake.
ELIZABETH: Yet you survived?
JASMINE: I had been left with my grandparents. I am the only one now.
ELIZABETH: Perhaps the Lord God Almighty has preserved your life for a special purpose?
MARY: (placing her hands on JASMINE) May he be mindful of the humble state of his servant Jasmine. May
the mighty one do great things for you as he has for me.
JASMINE: Do you think you could start at the beginning and tell me everything about how all this came about?
(Mary and Elizabeth nod “yes” )
MARY: Would you like to hold him while we talk? (Offering Jesus to her)
JASMINE: I would be honored. (Carefully and reverently taking and cuddling the baby)
As the lights slowly dim we see them settling to talk.
Scene 14 – before the curtain, stage right.
The three teens are sitting, talking.
MESHACH: (eagerly) So, what is HE like? Tell me everything.

AZARIAH: (trying to put difficult to describe things into words) He is just a little baby. But you can tell, There
is something… different about him.
JASMINE: And different about his mother and aunt. His mother Mary isn’t much older than I am.
AZARIAH: Mary’s husband is a carpenter from Nazareth. They seem like an ordinary couple. But pretty
poor. Joseph told us they couldn’t afford to sacrifice a lamb at Jesus’ circumcision. They had to offer two
birds. I think the gifts we brought will help them out quite a bit.
JASMINE They had to travel all the way from Nazareth to Bethlehem with her about to have a baby.
(AZARIAH appears to hear someone calling him and exits) I can’t imagine how difficult that trip was. But that
wasn’t the worst of it. Every inn was filled to capacity because of the census. They had to hole up in a cave.
MESHACH: (greatly disappointed) I can’t believe I came all this way and didn’t get to see him.
JASMINE: (genuine) I wish you could have. I can’t describe how it has started to change me. Meshach, I am
so sorry. It is all my fault. I shouldn’t have been so selfish. I should have thought about how my actions could
affect you.
MESHACH: Don’t blame yourself.
JASMINE: But you have always stood by me, every time I came up with some harebrained scheme. I never
realized before what a treasure it is to have someone stand by me, no matter what.
MESHACH: (Looks at her, wondering where that comment came from, then lightens the moment with humor)
It was pretty boring those years we were apart.
JASMINE: (looking at him) Yeah, I missed you a lot.
MESHACH: I missed you too. I’m afraid that once we get home, they’ll never let us see each other again
because of all of this.
JASMINE: (softly) That will be terrible! (AZARIAH enters in a hurry, interrupting what is about to become a
tender moment between them)
AZARIAH: (Intense and rushed) We are leaving immediately. Get your things packed.
JASMINE and MESHACH ad lib “What’s wrong?” “What’s going on” “Slow down, tell us about it.”
AZARIAH: All three of our Magi had the exact same dream at the exact same time. We have been warned to
NOT return to Herod but to return home by another route. We must leave immediately so the child remains
safe. (JASMINE and MESHACH jump up and begin gathering things together)
JASMINE: (stops) Shouldn’t someone warn Mary and Joseph?
AZARIAH: I don’t know. All I know is we have to leave now. Don’t do anything foolish, Jasmine. (exits)
JASMINE: Somebody should warn them. (grabbing MESHACH’s arm) You should go and then catch up with
us later. Warn them. Then you’d get to see the child.

MESHACH: I could, couldn’t I? (takes a deep breath) No. I can’t think of what I want at a time like this. I
have to think of the child first. I’m going to ask my father what he thinks.
JASMINE: He might say “No”.
MESHACH: I know. But it is the right thing to do.
JASMINE: It is. Hurry. (lights out, lights up stage left on MELCHOIR who is packing, putting on disguise.
Jasmine exits and dons disguise)
MESHACH: Father!
MELCHOIR: Get packed. We leave immediately.
MESHACH: Azariah told us. But father, shouldn’t someone warn Mary and Joseph?
MELCHOIR: Oh! (pondering) Yes, but it could be dangerous. If we are being followed, we could lead
Herod’s people right to them. On the other hand, maybe we are here to warn them. (Jasmine starts her cross to
stage left) Let me ask the others. (exits)
JASMINE: (entering stage left light) What did he say?
MESHACH: He went to ask the others.
JASMINE: Get your disguise on so you can leave immediately if they say to go. (JASMINE helps him as he
disguises himself. MELCHOIR rushes in)
MELCHOIR: Yes, they should be warned. (chastising himself) I shouldn’t have sent Azariah on ahead. (They
shakes heads “no” and JASPER enters, moving quickly, yet stiffly, like this is difficult for a man of his years)
MESHACH: I can go with Jasmine to guide me. If anyone stops us, we can pretend to be husband and wife,
here for the census.
JASPER: (to JASMINE) Can you find the house again?
JASMINE: Absolutely. (JASPER nods “OK”)
MELCHOIR: Then go with all speed. Meet us on the path that leads out of Bethlehem to the south. (JASMINE
and MESHACH nod “ok” and exit. Lights out)
Scene 15 – interior of Zechariah’s house

At rise: Zechariah and Elizabeth are packing up. Knock on the door. ZECHARIAH crosses to open the door
and admit JASMINE and MESHACH.

JASMINE: There is trouble. This is Meshach, Melchoir’s son.
MESHACH: We came to warn you. Our Magi have been warned in a dream. We have been told not to return
to Herod but to return home another way.
ZECHARIAH: We know there is trouble brewing. Joseph also had a dream.
JASMINE: Where are they?
ELIZABETH: They are gone.
JASMINE: Are you going too?
ZECHARIAH: Not with them. But we are leaving.
ELIZABETH: We did not wait all these years for a son only to wait for trouble to find us.
ZECHARIAH: If your grandfather could come 1200 miles at his age, then we too can put whatever distance we
need between our John and danger.
The following two lines are “private” between JASMINE and ELIZABETH
JASMINE: God has called you to an adventure.
ELIZABETH: So it would seem.
JASMINE: I will pray for all six of you.
ELIZABETH: Thank you.
MESHACH: We must go. (Pulls JASMINE with him toward the door) May the God of Daniel, Shadrach,
Meshach and Abednego watch over you and preserve your lives and the lives of the children as he did our
forefathers.
ZECHARIAH: Go with God.
Scene 16- before the curtain
JASMINE and MESHACH sneak across stage. Optional: have extras milling about, one group crossing stage
right to left and the other left to right.
Scene 17
At rise: HEROD on throne surrounded by courtiers, priest.

HEROD: (Angry) What do you mean, they are gone?

CHIEF COURTIER: Sire, we followed them to their lodging. They did not leave until the next day, and then
they went to some field to speak to a bunch of shepherds and buy a lamb. The next day they took the lamb back
and looked though the entire flock again but did not choose one.
HEROD: (Yelling) And you didn’t think that was some kind of distraction?
CHIEF COURTIER: No, I thought they were looking for the perfect sacrifice or something before they
presented it to this king… child.
HEROD: So where did they go from there?
CHIEF COURTIER: I don’t know. After a few days I knocked on the door to their lodging. But it was a family
from across the Jordan here for the census. Someone had paid them two month’s wages to stay inside the home
for a week or so and pretend to be the Magi. They had their robes and everything.
HEROD: And then you finally caught on that they had outwitted you.
CHIEF COURTIER: (trying to keep out of trouble with excuses) Your majesty, I am sorry. Bethlehem is so
crowded with the census, not even people who have lived there all their lives can keep track of who’s who.
HEROD: This situation requires drastic measures. This child is a threat to my throne. If no one can tell me
which child it is, then I shall slay them all. I want every child under the age of one slain. (There is a moment of
stunned silence as the courtiers think about the wholesale slaughter of innocents Herod is ordering)
PRIEST: Sire, reconsider, please. Many innocent lives will be needlessly snuffed out.
CHIEF COURTIER: Think of how the people will take this news. It could endanger your popularity.
HEROD: (almost irrationally irate) I have no popularity. I have power. And I’m not afraid to use it.
(frighteningly calm) You want me to reconsider? I’ll reconsider. Make it every baby two years of age and
under. That way I’ll get that priest’s child as well. (No one moves. Pause. Herod points to COURTIER) You
heard me. Relay the orders to the soldiers. I want my wishes carried out before the sun rises tomorrow.
Move!
Scene 18- before curtain
Darkness. Soldiers chasing fleeing mothers carrying children. Shouts, screams, shrieks and weeping.

Scene 19 – desert oasis

AZARIAH: They’ve seen us and are making their way here.
JASPER: Thank the Lord for his protection. It is a wonder this journey hasn’t been the death of me.
MELCHOIR: We aren’t home yet. (MESHACH and JASMINE arrive. Hugs and greetings)

BELTHASAR: Did you warn them?
MESHACH: It was unnecessary. Joseph had also been warned in a dream. They left immediately.
JASMINE: Elizabeth and Zechariah are going too, but somewhere else.
MESHACH: We didn’t ask about their destinations. I thought it best if we didn’t know.
JASPER: That was wise.
MECHOIR: That was better thinking that I’ve seen in some time.
BALTHASAR: They have enough gold to go to the ends of the earth twice, if need be.
JASPER: And enough to live on, no matter where they go..
BALTHASAR: While we are stopped, there is still the matter of consequences for the three of you. The three
of us have had time to think and confer. We have decided upon suitable penalties.
AZARIAH: (trying in vain to defend himself) But I’ve told you. I had no idea. I wasn’t part of this.
BALTHASAR: I believe you son. But you should have noticed. You need to be aware of what is going on
around you. So, you shall be on guard duty the entire journey home. That should hone your skills of
observation.
AZARIAH: Every night? When will I sleep?
BALTHASAR: (voice lightening up) As a young man I learned to sleep while riding a camel. I’m sure you’ll be
able to do the same. (AZARIAH glares at JASMINE and MESHACH)
JASPER: Jasmine, I should never have indulged you after your parents died. I cannot change the past but I can
see to your future. I would see you safely settled in a home. Therefore you will be married as soon as we arrive
home. (JASMINE abruptly sits and gathers herself into a fetal position, her face bowed and hidden)
MELCHOIR: (lecturing) Meshach, this is not the first time you have been involved in some harebrained
scheme but it is the first time you are old enough to be fully accountable for your actions. (less severe) You
have suffered an enormous consequence in traveling all this way, but not seeing the Christ child.
However, additional responsibility may be just the thing you need. Jasper, on the other hand, is ready to
relinquish some of his. From this day hence, you are responsible for any and all of Jasmine’s actions since you
will be marrying her as soon as we return to Persia.
MESHACH is stunned. MESHACH sinks to the ground slowly. He looks around to see if they are joking, He
looks at Jasmine but her face is hidden. He sits, stunned and silent
BALTHASAR: (almost jovially) Besides, we can’t have Daniel’s line dying out.
JASPER: Now, we are tired and are going to sleep. Meshach, she is officially your problem as of now. Good
night. (JASPER exits)

BALTHASAR: Azariah, I believe you have guard duty. (All but Azariah, Jasmine and Meshach exit to retire).
AZARIAH: Well, I guess congratulations are in order. (Smiling big and clapping MESHACH on the shoulder)
Compared to you, I think I got off pretty easy. (Exits)
There are a few moments of uncomfortable silence.
MESHACH: I don’t know what to say. I know the last thing you ever wanted was to be a wife and mother. I
feel like an executioner.
JASMINE: (picking her head up to look at him) Are you sure you don’t feel like a trapped rabbit? Or a
condemned criminal?
MESHACH: (some confusion) I’m not sure how I feel. How I should feel. (beat) I would feel a whole lot
better about it if I knew how you felt.
JASMINE: I told you I’ve been thinking about some things Mary and Elizabeth said to me. The short story is:
I’ve decided being a wife and mother could quite possibly be an adventure.
MESHACH: (not believing his ears) You what?
JASMINE: I don’t quite have it all sorted out. But to hear Mary and Elizabeth talk about being mothers and
then thinking about the part they play in what’s going on…..It could be alright. (a couple of beats of silence)
MESHACH: That’s good, at least. (afraid to know the answer but he has to ask) But what about the fact you
have to marry me?
JASMINE: (Smiling) I couldn’t think of anyone I’d rather marry.
MESHACH: Really?
JASMINE: Yeah, and not just because you’re fun, clever and cute. (seriously) It’s because you have always
stood by me, no matter what we’ve gotten ourselves into. Elizabeth said Zechariah stood by her all those years
she ached for a child, when other people made fun of her or pitied her. Mary told me how Joseph stood by her
when everyone was gossiping about her being with someone else’s child. I realized then, how much I respected
you for always standing by me. So, yeah, I’m glad they picked you.
(MESHACH smiles, they scoot together and smiling, JASMINE lays her head on his shoulder. They sit in
companionable silence for a moment then….)
MESHACH: So you think I’m clever and cute?
JASMINE: Yeah.
MESHACH: Really?
JASMINE: Really.

PRODUCTION NOTES:
A great number of extras, including children, can be incorporated into the show. While this can complicate
matters for a director, the benefits may outweigh the difficulties. Every cast member is part of the ministry of
sharing the message of Jesus Christ come into the world. Especially for children, the repetition in rehearsal and
performance firmly cements the birth of Jesus in their minds. Years after the show closes, the story of Jesus’
birth will live on in more realistic detailed memories than mere reading or seeing can provide.
Additional cast can also serve as living set pieces, bystanders, servants, merchants, soldiers, etc, eliminating the
need for more elaborate sets. Members of the cast often find inviting the unchurched or unbelieving friends,
family and neighbors (and getting them to come) is easier than when they are not actively involved.
Songs are suggested between the acts for a couple of reasons. One, Christmas music is a joy that comes for
only a month or so each year. Songs also provide an opportunity for set and costume changes.
CAST:
Meshach – teenage boy, reserved
Jasmine – teenage girl, outgoing
Suki – young male approximately the height and size of Jasmine
Azariah – teens, early 20’s. Dignified
Jasper- the oldest Magi and Jasmine’s grandfather
Melchoir – middle aged Magi and Meshach’s father
Belthasar – middle aged Magi and Azariah’s’ father
Mary – mother of Jesus
Joseph- Mary’s husband
Elizabeth – mother of John
Zechariah – father of John
Herod - king
Chief Courtier
Priest
Spy
Extras as soldiers, courtiers, servants, people on the street
COSTUMES:
Time period costumes with the following notations:
The Magi (Melchoir, Jasper and Belthasar) should have elegant Persian royalty costumes as well as beggar
outfits that easily slip over the regal costumes. Azariah, Meshach and Jasmine have regal costumes but not as
elaborate as the Magi. Suki has Persian garb. Lines in scene 3 referring to the color of the Magi’s garments
may need to be adjusted to reflect actual costumes.
Herod dresses as a King in Judea. Costume should contrast with that of the Magi.

NARR: Once upon a time there was a king. And the king said
KING: Let there be light (Light brightens)
NARR: And there was light. The king saw that the light was good, and he separated the light
from the darkness. He called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” The king ruled
over his kingdom of light and it was all good. Then the King adopted a daughter and made her a
princess. (PRINCESS enters and is further illuminated) She had everything she needed.
NARR: One day darkness entered the kingdom. (DARK MAN enters holding out an apple to
PRINCESS. PRINCESS takes off her crown, trades it for apple and bites the apple. It is bitter
and she drops it in disgust. KING looks horrified)

NARR: The princess traded away her crown for a lie and in doing so, sold herself as a slave to
the darkness. (DARK MAN wraps chains around her wrists binding them) She threw away her
birthright and became a poor, blind, miserable commoner. (PRINCESS and DARK MAN exit
into darkness) The darkness surrounded her and though she cried pitifully over what she had
done, she could neither regain her royal status nor free herself from slavery.
VOICE of PRINCESS: (calling out, afraid) Where is the light? Where is my father the king? I
am afraid. Help me!
NARR: The more the princess tried to save herself, the more she stumbled. Her beautiful clothes
became rags and many wounds were all she got for her efforts. (PRINCE enters to KING) The
king was sad. His son, the prince, too grieved.
KING: She has traded away her birthright and now she suffers. She cannot find her own way
from the darkness. She cannot buy her own freedom.
PRINCE: Then I will save her, though it cost all I am and have. (exits. PRINCESS re-enters,
disheveled and dressed in rags with wounds and bloody bandages including one over her eyes.
She collapses in a miserable heap under a dim red light held by DARK MAN.
NARR: So the king sent messengers on ahead so the princess would be ready to be saved by the
prince.
MESSENGER 1: The moon will shine like the sun, and the sunlight will be seven times brighter,
like the light of seven full days, when the LORD binds up the bruises of his people and heals the
wounds of the princess. (PRINCESS examines her wounds and winces as she moves because
they are so painful. When she speaks, it is with desperate pain, shame and remorse)
PRINCESS: I want to be healed.
MESSENGER 2: The prince will lead the blind by ways they have not known, along unfamiliar
paths He will guide them; He will turn the darkness into light before them and make the rough
places smooth. These are the things the prince will do; He will not forsake his princess.
PRINCESS: I want to see again.
MESSENGER 3: The sun will no more be your light by day, nor will the brightness of the moon
shine on you, for the Prince will be your everlasting light, and your King will be your glory.
Your sun will never set again, and your moon will wane no more; the Prince will be your
everlasting light, and your days of sorrow will end.
PRINCESS: Yes, let my sorrow end.

NARR: And so the prince stepped down into darkness. SONG Light of the world you stepped
down into darkness. STAR CARRIER appears holding a lighted star over the PRINCE. Slowly
they make their way toward the PRINCESS during the song.
NARR: A star served as a beacon of light, drawing those who were wise to the prince. Through
this prince all things had been made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him
was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. His light shone in the darkness, and the
darkness could not overcome it. (DARK MAN forces PRINCESS to take his red light, he
sabotages the reconciliation, whispering lies in the princess’ ears and pulling her back when she
reaches for the PRINCE.)
Yet, though the world, including the princess, was made through the Prince, the princess did not
recognize him. The darkness blinded her. If she would only receive him, he would give the
right to become a child of the king once again.
PRINCE: (Reaching toward her and gently calling for her) You are a child of the light and a
child of the day. You not belong to the night or to the darkness, but you are a princess, daughter
of the king who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light. (DARK MAN puts the
PRINCESSES hands over her ears)
NARR: But the princess closed her ears as well as her eyes.
PRINCE: (more urgently) I have come into the world as a light, so you do not have to stay in
darkness. Whoever walks in the dark does not know where they are going. Believe in
my light while you have the light, so that you once again may become a child of the king. (As
PRINCESS starts to reach for the PRINCE, DARK MAN gets between them and jerks her back to
her misery)
NARR: But the princess did not leave the darkness. (DARK MAN moves slyly behind the prince,
He pantomimes nailing his feet to a cross.)
PRINCE: (pleading most urgently, holding out his arms to her) I am the light of the world.
Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life. (DARK MAN
physically takes the PRINCE’s arms and pantomimes nailing them to a cross) While I am in the
world, I am the light of the world. You are going to have the light just a little while longer. Walk
to me while you have the light, before darkness overtakes you. (Pause for 2 beats but the
princess does NOT come. PRINCE bows head in death. KING, face filled with grief, turns away
from the PRINCE.
NARR: Yet the princess did not come to him, though he paid for her life with his own.
PRINCESS is crying, loudly at first, and then muffled occasional sobs. PRINCE and DARKMAN
exit.
NARR: This is the message we have heard from the Prince and declare to you: the King is light;
in him there is no darkness at all. If we walk in the King’s light, as the Prince is in the light, we

have fellowship with one another, and the blood of the Prince, his Son, purifies us. (PRINCE
appears next to NARR)
PRINCE: You (pointing to audience) are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be
hidden. (STAR CARRIER takes candle from under the star and holds it up) Neither do people
light a candle and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to
everyone in the house. (STAR CARRIER drops star backstage or hooks it above the stage to
continue to be seen)
PRINCE: In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds
and glorify your Father in heaven. For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the
Lord. Live as children of light. For the king, who said, (KING turns back around)
KING: “Let light shine out of darkness,”
PRINCE: … made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of His glory
displayed in the face of Christ.
PRINCE: Who will add their candle? Who will add their light? Who will reach my princess, all
my princesses, who are in darkness? Sing with us. (Cast begins to sing This Little light of mine.
Audience members should be encouraged to add their voices. As they do the PRINCESS. takes
off eye bandages and finally comes to the prince and KING who welcome her with joy)

FOREMAN: (pleased) Sir, your land was very productive this year. We can’t store all the grain and produce.
ANGEL: (joyful) Give thanks to the Lord, and let everyone know how he has blessed you.
DEVIL: (immediately grabbing RICH MAN by shoulders and spinning RICH MAN to face him) Time for that
later. You need to figure out what to do.
RICH MAN: What should I do, since I don’t have anywhere to store my crops?
ANGEL: (Tapping him on the shoulder) Take a moment and be thankful.
DEVIL: (grabbing RICH MAN’S shoulders and attention) You worked hard for this. Don’t lose it now.
RICH MAN: I’ll tear down my barns and build bigger ones and store all my grain and my goods there.
DEVIL: (congratulating RICH MAN) And that is just the start. (arm around RICH MAN so they can stare off
into the distance stage left, imagining …) When you eat and are full, build beautiful houses to live in.
ANGEL: (concerned) Be careful that your heart doesn’t become proud and you forget God.
RICH MAN: (boasting) My power and my own ability have gained this wealth for me.

you have.

Lord gives you the power to gain wealth.

drink, and enjoy yourself.

ANGE: Don’t be so foolish! What if, this very night, your life is demanded of you? These earthly possessions
you have prepared—whose will they be? RICH MAN seems startled by this thought and starts to turn toward
ANGEL but DEVIL spins him back toward DEVIL
DEVIL: Ignore that pessimist. (taking out gold watch and chain and swinging it back and forth to hypnotize
RICH MAN) You did this yourself and you deserve to enjoy by yourself.
RICH MAN: (in a trance) Right. I did this and I deserve to enjoy it.
DEVIL: Whoever ends up with the most toys wins.
RICH MAN: (still entranced) Most toys wins.
ANGEL: (Sadly) One’s life is not summed up by the abundance of his possessions.
DEVIL: (guiding RICH MAN by the arm toward the “hell” sign) Let’s go on vacation – somewhere very warm
with lots of successful people just like yourself. Dazed RICH MAN allows himself to be guided.
ANGEL: (Saddened, and motioning toward “hell” sign) That’s where you end up when you store up treasure
for yourself and are not rich toward God.
DEVIL: (aside to audience) It’s easy to trick humans.
ANGEL: Though they knew God, they don’t glorify Him as God or show gratitude.
DEVIL: (swinging the watch) Instead, their thinking becomes nonsense, and their senseless minds are
darkened.
ANGEL (Grieved): Claiming to be wise, they become fools
DEVIL: Then time is up. (catching up the watch with a flourish). And it’s too late

Salome - One of the supporters of Jesus, mother of James and John
Joanna - Wife of Cuza, supporter of Jesus
Mary Magdela - somewhat disheveled appearance, striking hair
Mother Mary - the mother of Jesus, older, serene
Martha - sister of Lazarus
PROPS: Pots, jars, baskets, some loaves of baked bread, a kneading trough and dough, cheese, other kitchen
implements, towels
SETTING: The kitchen of a first century Jewish home, during the night described in Acts 12. Two stools, a
table and a bench
RUN TIME: 27 minutes
SCRIPTURE/BASED ON: Acts 12 with references to the Gospels and Acts 1-12.
HOSTESS MARY: (Patiently trying to explain to a wiggly, impatient Rhoda) Rhoda. I will need a lot of help
tonight. There will be at least 50 people, maybe 100. I don’t know. But there will be much to do. There will
not be time for playing or jokes. Now, hand me the oil then bring me some water in the red clay jar. (During this
exchange HOSTESS MARY is making bread and other kitchen related tasks and Rhoda is assisting when she is
not asking questions)
RHODA: Why are so many people coming here? Is this another feast? You Jews have a lot of feasts.
HOSTESS MARY: Our dear brother Peter has been thrown in prison by Herod.
RHODA: You have a brother named Peter?
HOSTESS MARY: He’s a Christian brother. We are going to pray for his release
RHODA: Why aren’t you going to your temple to pray and sacrifice? In Egypt we would go to the temple of
Isis and pray to her because she is the protector goddess of women. She might listen if we sacrificed enough.
HOSTESS MARY: Jesus taught us that true worship is about the Spirit and truth, not the place.
RHODA: Is it true that John Mark angered your High Priest? Will the priest make trouble for him? Why
doesn’t John Mark just take a sacrifice and say he’s sorry?
HOSTESS MARY: Because he is not sorry. The priests and teachers of the law are wrong. They never should
have stoned Stephen. John Mark seems to think it is his place to rebuke them. (a but unsure of what she is
saying) I don’t know if it was a wise thing to do or not. As a mother I think it was exceedingly foolish.
(Confidently) But as a Christian I know it was the right thing to do. But that is not for me to decide right now.
Right now we have bread to make and fish to grill and many other tasks to be hospitable. I hear our first guests

arriving.
SALOME: (Enters while removing hood from her head.) Shalom. I have come to join in the prayers for Peter.
I thought you might need some help in the kitchen.
HOSTESS MARY: I would be glad for your help. I have 5 loaves of bread rising but I think we’ll need more.
The flour is in the jar. There is water in this jar (indicating with a tilt of her head).
SALOME: (concerned, dropping her voice) It is well we meet here and not at the temple courts.
RHODA: Why?
HOSTESS MARY: The Jewish leaders might make trouble. The Romans might make trouble. Or Herod might
have more Christians arrested and killed. Rhoda, go make sure there is water enough for washing any arrival’s
feet and watering a donkeys.
RHODA: Wash, wash, wash. You Jews wash everything all the time. (Exits)
HOSTESS MARY: Salome, I am so sorry about your son, James.
SALOME: (Who has jumped right in to the food preparation) Thank God it was quick. (Quieter) I pray
Peter does not die, but if he must die let it be quickly like James, a beheading not a crucifixion. I don’t think I
could ever bear to watch another one of those.
HOSTESS MARY: (Strong, matter of fact) We are all praying that Peter will be released. God did it before
when Peter and your son John were arrested together. After they healed that crippled man.
RHODA: (Entering loudly) Eight more people have arrived. One of them brought a donkey.
HOSTESS MARY: (pointing off stage) Feet and donkey. (RHODA exits)
SALOME: (Regaining her composure and wanting to change the subject) She’s a Gentile isn’t she?
HOSTESS MARY: Yes, Egyptian. I think she had some idea of Jewish customs but The Way has been a shock
to her. Living with us has been ... confusing to say the least.
SALOME: How long has she been here?
HOSTESS MARY: A few weeks. Rather unplanned too. John Mark was passing by a slave auction when he
heard her screams. Her family had run up debts they could not pay. They were sold into slavery. Her father and
two brothers had already been sold. The mother was being taken away by her new owners and Rhoda was
objecting. Loudly. And violently
SALOME: I don’t imagine that went over well
HOSTESS MARY: (becoming more serious) No. They started beating her. John Mark stepped in. He told
them damaged property would bring them less money and offered 5 pieces of silver for her. They agreed almost
too swiftly. (With a soft chuckle) He joked later that he probably could have been paid by them to take her

away.
SALOME: She seems to have adjusted to her new life.
HOSTESS MARY: (With a smile) Yes and the scratches on John Mark have faded away.
MOTHER MARY: (Entering and pulling the hood from her head) Shalom.
HOSTESS MARY: (Greeting her with a hug, followed by SALOME hugging her) Shalom. I was hoping you
would come.
SALOME: (With concern) But it’s so late. It’s dangerous after dark for a woman to walk alone in the streets.
MOTHER MARY: I wasn’t alone. I came with Salome and John. He has become another son to me. He’s seen
Peter. Herod has him under heavy guard. Four squads of four soldiers each. John had no chance to speak to
him. How can I help?
HOSTESS MARY: Sit and rest a while first. Then I suppose we’ll need more bread. And these fish need to go
out to the courtyard to be grilled.
SALOME: I can do that. I saw the fire in the courtyard on my way in. (She takes the fish and a long fork and
exits)
HOSTESS MARY: I can’t believe how hard this must be for her… James being beheaded. Her other son
arrested.
MOTHER MARY: Yes. She grieves. She is having difficulty accepting the fact that God allowed her son James
to die. She asks why he was not freed by an angel like John and Peter when the Sanhedrin had them jailed. Why
not just a flogging?
HOSTESS MARY: Do you think she has accepted that this will not be an earthly kingdom? That John will not
become a ruler? Being a mother is not easy in these times. (glances at Mary and obviously stiffens as she
realizes what she has said to whom)
MOTHER MARY: It’s alright. I knew and accepted my son Jesus’ death long before it happened. It didn’t
make it any easier to watch. But I was somewhat prepared. Salome was not.
HOSTESS MARY: I can personally understand that. John Mark has been drawing attention to himself lately. I
worry. As a Christian I know I must accept God’s will. But it is hard to understand why he protects some and
not the others. Isn’t there another way? Besides, the Lord said whatever we asked for in prayer would be
granted. We prayed for James. Do you think it was because we did not believe?
MOTHER MARY: His ways are higher than ours. He is beyond understanding. Remember Jesus said “blessed
are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” Trials will come
and some will fall away like seed scattered on rocks.
HOSTESS MARY: Perhaps. It is so hard to know. What is a trial? What is a test? What is God’s will?

RHODA: (entering) Salome said to tell you the fish are on. Can I tend them?
HOSTESS MARY: Yes, but be careful. Don’t burn yourself.
RHODA: I’ll be careful. (exits)
MOTHER MARY: John Mark is becoming a fine young man. You must be proud of him.
HOSTESS MARY: (Strained and worried) I fear for him. He speaks out. (Salome re-enters) He has upset many
of the Jewish leaders. Not just what he says, although teaching the resurrection is inflammatory enough. They
think him disrespectful because of his age.
MOTHER MARY: If he’s young and rash he will outgrow it. If he speaks by the power of God, then he must
speak no matter how young he is. Jesus was only twelve when he began challenging the elders.
HOSTESS MARY: (To Mary mother of Jesus) Yes, but your son was the son of God.
MOTHER MARY: Every believer is a child of God.
RHODA: (Bursting in). I need more towels.
HOSTESS MARY: Did you leave the fish to burn?
RHODA: No. Some woman is tending them. She told me to get more towels for washing their feet. I must
have washed ten thousand feet already and they just keep coming. I hate washing feet. They’re dirty. They
stink. (SALOME enters)
HOSTESS MARY: (Reprimanding) It’s the job that falls to the youngest servant.
RHODA: But I hate it. Can’t someone else at least help me?
MOTHER MARY: Yes. I’ll go help you.

(Reaches a hand to Rhoda)

HOSTESS MARY: No, Mary. Not you. You’re an honored guest. The mother of our Lord.
MOTHER MARY: I insist. My son washed feet, even the feet of the one who betrayed him. Furthermore we
are taught that the greatest shall be the least and the servant of all. (takes Rhoda’s hand and they exit)
SALOME: She is an amazing woman. I can see why God chose her to mother his son.
HOSTESS MARY: Yes, it would take a remarkable woman.
(MARY MAGDELA enters carrying a covered basket)
MARY MAGDELA: (With a touch of drama) Greetings. A blessing upon this house. (Removes her head
covering which has hidden her face)
SALOME: Mary! (They hug, turning to HOSTESS MARY) This is Mary Magdela.

HOSTESS MARY: (Taken aback, a bit fearful) Yes. Of course. (Not going to greet her) The one .... I have
heard of you but we have never met. (finally stepping forward gingerly to take the basket MAGDELA proffers)
Greetings in the name of our Lord. (Steps back quickly)
MARY MAGDELA: Can I help? (Picks up a knife, thumps it into some cheese, staring at HOSTESS MARY
who draws back obviously frightened. SALOME stifles a giggle)
SALOME: Mary, it’s alright. She won’t hurt you or anything. (To MARY MAGDELA) I think Mary has heard
about the seven demons (HOSTESS MARY recovers)
HOSTESS MARY: (Chagrined) I am sorry. Please forgive me. I know Jesus cast them out. I just...
MARY MAGDELA: (Laughing) There is nothing to forgive. I have suffered far worse from others. And
sometimes it suits me to be given wide berth. Especially with the Romans and Herod’s soldiers and even our
own priests ready to persecute those of us who follow the Way. (JOANNA enters)
HOSTESS MARY: Welcome. This is Joanna. Her husband Cuza manages Herod’s household. (Women greet
each other)
MARY MAGDELA: (Adamantly with obvious disgust) Herod. That fox.
JOANNA: He is exactly that. (nodding, turning to MARY MAGDELA) I recognize you, now. You were at the
crucifixion and at the tomb.
MARY MAGDELA: I was the one who stayed behind and thought Jesus a gardener. I begged him to tell me
where the body was. (shaking her head at her own stupidity) After all the times I listened to Jesus speak, all the
times I watched him heal and cast out demons, I still had no clue. Then suddenly Jesus himself was there.
SALOME: But when you returned to us the men said you were talking nonsense. Peter and John finally decided
to see for themselves but the rest wrote you off as a hysterical female. (MOTHER MARY re-enters)
MARY MAGDELA: (chuckling) Maybe they thought the demons had come back. (getting serious for once and
turning to MOTHER MARY) Mary, You didn’t go to the tomb that morning. I always wanted to ask you about
that. Why did you stay behind?
MOTHER MARY: Because I knew Jesus wouldn’t be there.
HOSTESS MARY: How could you know that? You watched him die with your own 
MOTHER MARY: Yes I watched, not just on Calvary, but all 33 years of his life. I knew before he performed
his first miracle that he could and would.
MARY MAGDELA: (quietly amazed) That’s right. You coaxed him into turning water into wine at the wedding
in Cana.

MOTHER MARY: I knew he would rise again. That was the only thing that kept me from a total breakdown.
But even knowing he would rise, it was terrible. (MOTHER MARY falls silent, SALOME embraces her, MARY
MAGDELA places a hand on her shoulder)
HOSTESS MARY: Sons are a joy to a mother. But they are also the needle that pierces our hearts.
MOTHER MARY: Sometimes it is a sword - Simeon prophesied that a sword would pierce my heart and he
was right.
RHODA: (bursting in) Someone else is here. A man and his sisters. They came all the way from Bethany! They
brought all kinds of food too. A donkey load! They must be rich!
HOSTESS MARY: That would be Lazarus, Mary and Martha.
RHODA: Another Mary! I don’t think I can keep a 4th Mary straight.
MARY MAGDELA: You won’t have to. Mary won’t be in to help. She’ll be praying with the others. But we
can count on Martha’s help. (Chuckling) She truly has a servant’s heart but I suggest we all get busy or she’ll
assign us things to do. (To HOSTESS MARY) She tends to take charge.
HOSTESS MARY: (Not understanding) But this is my house. Would she take charge in someone else’s house?
ALL: Yes.
MARY MAGDELA: I’ll check the fish. I wouldn’t want Martha to find me sitting around. (The women all
smile as she exits and they get back to work)
SALOME: I’ll help (she exits as well)
RHODA: (Amazed at all the activity) How many more people are coming? The house is about to overflow with
people.
MOTHER MARY: There were 120 of us gathered in that upper room right after Jesus ascended from the Mount
of Olives.
RHODA: (Incredulous) 120! In one room! We’ll never fit 120!
JOANNA: I am concerned about too large a group. Cuza, that’s my husband, says Herod is targeting the
Christians. People will notice a large gathering. They’ll talk. It’s just not safe anywhere. After what happened

HOSTESS MARY: When the Sanhedrin put John and Peter in prison, God sent an angel to release them. Do
you think he will do the same again?
MOTHER MARY: I do not know. Peter’s fate is in God’s hands. We aren’t called to understand or agree. We
are called to submit.
HOSTESS MARY: It is hard being a woman. We have no status. We have no power. All we can do is wait
and watch.
MOTHER MARY: We women can serve. We can pray.
HOSTESS MARY: Yes. Prayer is a powerful force.
MOTHER MARY: And we have many gathered here to pray: (SALOME and MARY MAGDELA enter)
MARY MAGDELA: John Mark has taken over the grilling. Funny how men wouldn’t be caught dead in the
kitchen but they’ll grill outside.
HOSTESS MARY: I know this is part of God’s plan but why Peter? The Lord left him to lead us. He said
Peter would be the Rock. He’s healed, taught, and even raised the dead. (Emphatically) We need him.
SALOME: He did deny the Messiah.
MARY MAGDELA: We all slip at one time or another. Some of us so far that only God’s tender love and
grace could possibly reach us.
MOTHER MARY: Peter hasn’t let fear control him since then. That’s changed. He’s been forgiven and was
told to strengthen the brothers. Not once since then has he failed to proclaim Jesus as the Messiah. He stood up
to the Sanhedrin. He defies the chief priests and elders.
MARY MAGDELA: We can only hope that’s from God, not Peter’s impulsiveness, his rash plunging into the
hornet’s nest. He’s stirred up the believers as well, baptizing gentiles.
SALOME: Everyone is amazed that he and John were just ordinary, unschooled fishermen. They are truly a
living testament to God’s power - how he can change, how he can empower. You know this for yourself, Mary,
how your transformation affected everyone. How it gives hope that anyone, even a demon possessed woman,
can be changed.
HOSTESS MARY: Look at how that Saul of Tarsus changed.
MARY MAGDELA: Yes. But we have to rely on the power of the creator, not the created.

SALOME: I see. Perhaps we are relying on Peter, rather than God.
MARY MAGDELA: Maybe. I believe God wants every believer to be his messenger. Everything is changed
Salome, everything. It’s not just being released from the law. Everyone one of us is called to share the good
news. It’s not just the priests or the rabbis or even the apostles. Its ordinary people. Even women.
MOTHER MARY: Even mothers
RHODA: (Entering, exaggeratedly weary sounding) John Mark said to for me to bring some bread and cheese.
(With more interest) He and some old man were talking about an angel letting Peter and John out of prison. Did
that really happen? (her voice starts to speed up as she gets more curious) What does an angel look like? Do you
think the angel will let Peter out too?
MOTHER MARY: (pulls Rhoda to her and holds her) Only God knows. May his will not ours be done.
MARTHA: (entering with basket and jar) Blessings upon this home. (All the women greet her, Hostess Mary
takes the basket)
MARTHA: (Businesslike) I brought bread (indicating the basket with a nod of her head). We also brought oil,
raisins and wine. Lazarus thought there might be a crowd.
HOSTESS MARY: I appreciate it, Martha.
MARTHA: God has blessed my family richly. And the master taught us to share. (Looking around assessing the
situation and taking charge) What shall I do? Have we set anything out yet? I thought I smelled fish being
cooked. Is someone watching them? Do we have enough bread - there were at least 50 people praying when we
arrived and I didn’t see Thomas or Matthias yet. How many are you prepared for?
MOTHER MARY: (With a knowing smile) This Mary has everything well in hand. But we wouldn’t want you
to be idle. (To the others) Martha makes the most marvelous raisin bread and since you brought raisins...
MARTHA: Yes. I’ll get started (Starts assembling what she’ll need). This could take a while. My sister and I
waited four days for an answer to our prayer for Lazarus.
JOANNA: Martha, how did you manage in that four days?
MARTHA: I knew Jesus was the Messiah. Even death, kneels to the Christ, the son of the living God.
JOANNA: When Peter spoke at Pentecost - when Cuza and I were baptized along with thousands of others,
Peter didn’t seem like a fisherman at all.

HOSTESS MARY: It’s public knowledge that he raised Dorcas from the dead. People line the streets just in case
his shadow falls on a loved one and heals them.
MARTHA: That’s not necessarily a good thing. Remember what happened when it became public Lazarus was
raised from the dead? Remember how the leaders decided it was best for one man to die, or even two?
JOANNA: (Puzzled) Two?
MARY MAGDELA: Yes, two. They talked about killing Lazarus as well. Stop the talk about resurrection.
(Mulling things over) Things aren’t like at first. At first we were in the favor of the Jews. (Certain) Now that’s
changed. They send men around to round us up like sheep to be slaughtered. (Rhoda obviously has stopped
working and is listening intently to the conversation)
JOANNA: Like Stephen. They accused him of blasphemy and stoned him. (Rhoda’s face shows some distress at
this. Hostess Mary notices and gives a nod to the others to be quiet)
HOSTESS MARY: Rhoda - we have many guests and need much more water. Fill all the jars by the olive tree
in the courtyard with water.
RHODA: All 7 of them?
HOSTESS MARY: Yes, all 7.
RHODA: (Protesting) But they’re huge. It takes 20 trips to the well to fill each one!!
HOSTESS MARY: Then you best get started. (Rhoda starts to leave, stops for a hug from MOTHER MARY
and lingers)
JOANNA: Is it safe for her to be out this late?
HOSTESS MARY: The courtyard wall is high. My John Mark has also posted a few of the lads about to keep
watch. We’ll be warned if there is a problem.
JOANNA: It grows dark. Herod’s spies are everywhere not to mention those of the chief priests and the Roman
invaders. Maybe you should lock the doors.
HOSTESS MARY: Yes. Rhoda - ask John Mark to lock the doors now that it is dark. Tell him what Joanna
just said. We should not let anyone in that we do not know. Now Go (RHODA exits) (Worried) John is so
young to have all this responsibility but since his father died he has to take care of things. I don’t know what I
would do without him

RHODA: (Bursting in) Peter’s here, He’s at the door!
HOSTESS MARY: (Sharply) Rhoda! Now is not a time to play.
MARY MAGDELA: (Mildly reproving) Hold on. Sometimes the most unbelievable news is the truest?
RHODA: But it is true. I saw Peter. He’s at the door!

SALOME: She could be seeing his angel. (To Joanna) Do you think Herod would have executed him tonight before the trial?
JOANNA: That’s not likely. Herod likes show. He’d want to make a spectacle of the execution. He’s wound up
in public opinion, playing to the masses. I think he’d do anything for attention.
RHODA: (emphatic) No, really! It’s Peter. Really. (Pleadingly to MOTHRER MARY) Really.
making it up. Why are you all praying if you don’t think he’ll be freed?

I’m not

HOSTESS MARY: Rhoda, you’ve only seen Peter once. It’s dark outside. I believe you think its Peter.
RHODA: (Louder) But it is Peter!
MOTHER MARY: Rhoda (holding out her hand) Let’s go see. (They exit)
JOANNA: Mary! It could be Herod’s soldiers. They might be looking for more Christians to put to death! Or
someone from the chief priests or even Roman soldiers. . (Turning to the others) Maybe we should disperse.
(Those remaining look at each other in silence for a beat)
HOSTESS MARY: My John! My John Mark! Where is he? (Short pause of confusion and concern then
MOTHER MARY and RHODA enter. Women ad lib Was it him? Really him? Is he alright? How did he
escape? Where is he now? )
RHODA: (Shouting above the questions) He left! (noise stops)
MOTHER MARY: (Taking charge and motioning them to be quiet) I’ll tell you, keep your voices down. We
may be in more danger than we realized. They may have already discovered him missing. (The women prepare
to listen)
RHODA :( Loud stage whisper) He said an angel came for him!
HOSTESS MARY: Shhhhhhh Let Mary talk.
RHODA: But he did! He said an angel made the chains fall off and the city gate opened by itself! (HOSTESS
MARY cuddling Rhoda to quiet her down, turning toward MOTHER MARY) What did Peter say?
MOTHER MARY: He was sleeping when a light and the angel poking him on the side awoke him. The angel
told him to get dressed and follow him. Peter said he thought he was dreaming.
JOANNA: He had a vision before when he was sent to speak to Cornelius.

MARTHA: Peter would have realized it was something from God. Go on.
MOTHER MARY: He was chained between two of the sixteen guards assigned to...
RHODA: 16 guards!! 16 - that’s a  (HOSTESS MARY shushes her)
MOTHER MARY: All 16 of them were sleeping. (pauses knowingly for effect) He said the gates swung open
on their own. He got to the end of the street and the angel vanished. He guessed there would be a group of
believers here so he came to let us know he was leaving for a while. I imagine there will be quite a commotion
when the guards discover their prisoner is missing.
JOANNA: (In a chilled voice) Herod will have them all executed. That’s the Roman penalty for losing a prisoner
condemned to die. You take the condemned man’s place. (A beat of silence as they think about that)
MARTHA: It won’t be long until someone suggests they look here. (HOSTESS MARY looked frightened by the
prospect)
JOANNA: And with no victim for public trial Herod will be looking for someone else to arrest.
MARTHA: Joanna’s right. (To HOSTESS MARY) We are in danger and we are putting you and your family in
danger, Mary.
HOSTESS MARY: (stricken and fearful) My John. What if they come for John? (MOTHER MARY comes over
to her and holds her in an embrace)
MARTHA: (Putting her cloak on, taking charge) Let us take John Mark back to Bethany with us tonight.
Lazarus may be able to do something. (Other woman start gathering their cloaks, items preparing to leave)
(HOSTESS MARY (starts to weep, MOTHER MARY comforts her)
JOANNA: Good idea, Martha. If soldiers find a group of Christians here they just might seize the owner’s son.
MARTHA: If it seems best we’ll send him even further away.
MOTHER MARY: Isn’t his cousin Barnabas returning to Antioch soon?
HOSTESS MARY: Yes.
MARTHA: Then it would be good for John Mark to go with him. At least for a time.
HOSTESS MARY: (teary, overwhelmed) But he’s my son, my firstborn and my only son. I’m not ready for him
to go anywhere. How will we manage without him?

MARTHA: Leave that to me. We’ll see you are taken care of as long as needed. My brother Lazarus will be
able to help.
MOTHER MARY: Sons cause great joy, but even the best of sons can be a great heartache. Sometimes we have
to let them go. (Takes HOSTESS MARY’S face in her hands and looks directly at her, speaking gently but
reassuringly) He’ll be in God’s hands, Mary.
HOSTESS MARY: (still fighting the logic of it) But he has no provisions. (her thoughts are scattered) What
should I pack?
MARTHA: (comforting her with a hug) I’ll see to it that he has everything he needs. We’ll send word. God be
with you all (exits)
JOANNA: Mary, I must go too. Cuza will find out from Herod what’s going on and I’ll send word when we do
hear. We wish to cast no suspicion upon your house so it is best we meet elsewhere for a time. Thank you for
opening your home. May God’s peace dwell upon it? (She hugs and leaves)
RHODA: Do you want me to walk you home, Mary.
MOTHER MARY: (Kneeling down to be on eye level with her) No. But thank you. John will take care of me.
He’ll see I’m safe.
MARY MAGDELA :( to HOSTESS MARY) We are all under the protection of the Most High and His son.
Even if we must leave this body we know we will be with him in a mansion he has built for us. Do not lose heart.
Do not be afraid. Peace to you and this house. (Hugs HOSTESS MARY then she and MOTHER MARY exit)
RHODA: Why is John Mark leaving? Where is he going to go?
HOSTESS MARY: I don’t know. (Making up her mind to trust God) But I do know he will be in the hands of
God. That’s really all I have to know. (Taking a deep breath and getting her composure) I have to gather up
his things. He’ll need his cloak and a change of clothes, sturdy sandals - Rhoda, get the basket we take to market
and bring it here. (Rhoda starts to leave, turns)
RHODA: It’s hard to be a mother, isn’t it?
HOSTESS MARY: Yes, I think it’s the hardest thing in the world. But I am so thankful we all have a heavenly
father who loves us and cares for us.

HOSTESS MARY: Our dear brother Peter has been thrown in prison by Herod.
RHODA: You have a brother named Peter?
HOSTESS MARY: He’s a Christian brother. We are going to pray for his release
RHODA: Why aren’t you going to your temple to pray and sacrifice? In Egypt we would go to the temple of
Isis and pray to her because she is the protector goddess of women. She might listen if we sacrificed enough.
HOSTESS MARY: Jesus taught us that true worship is about the Spirit and truth, not the place.
RHODA: Is it true that John Mark angered your High Priest? Will the priest make trouble for him? Why
doesn’t John Mark just take a sacrifice and say he’s sorry?
HOSTESS MARY: Because he is not sorry. The priests and teachers of the law are wrong. They never should
have stoned Stephen. John Mark seems to think it is his place to rebuke them. (a bit unsure of what she is
saying) I don’t know if it was a wise thing to do or not. As a mother I think it was exceedingly foolish.
(Confidently) But as a Christian I know it was the right thing to do. But that is not for me to decide right now.
Right now we have bread to make and fish to grill and many other tasks to be hospitable. I hear our first guests
arriving.
SALOME: (Enters while removing hood from her head.) Shalom. I have come to join in the prayers for Peter.

I thought you might need some help in the kitchen.
HOSTESS MARY: I would be glad for your help. I have 5 loaves of bread rising but I think we’ll need more.
The flour is in the jar. There is water in this jar (indicating with a tilt of her head).
SALOME: (concerned, dropping her voice) It is well we meet here and not at the temple courts.
RHODA: Why?
HOSTESS MARY: The Jewish leaders might make trouble. The Romans might make trouble. Or Herod might
have more Christians arrested and killed. Rhoda, go make sure there is water enough for washing any arrival’s
feet and watering a donkeys.
RHODA: Wash, wash, wash. You Jews wash everything all the time. (Exits)
HOSTESS MARY: Salome, I am so sorry about your son, James.
SALOME: (Who has jumped right in to the food preparation) Thank God it was quick. (Quieter) I pray
Peter does not die, but if he must die let it be quickly like James, a beheading not a crucifixion. I don’t think I
could ever bear to watch another one of those.
HOSTESS MARY: (Strong, matter of fact) We are all praying that Peter will be released. God did it before
when Peter and your son John were arrested together. After they healed that crippled man.
RHODA: (Entering loudly) Eight more people have arrived. One of them brought a donkey.
HOSTESS MARY: (pointing off stage) Feet and donkey. (RHODA exits)
SALOME: (Regaining her composure and wanting to change the subject) She’s a Gentile isn’t she?
HOSTESS MARY: Yes, Egyptian. I think she had some idea of Jewish customs but The Way has been a shock
to her. Living with us has been ... confusing to say the least.
SALOME: How long has she been here?
HOSTESS MARY: A few weeks. Rather unplanned too. John Mark was passing by a slave auction when he
heard her screams. Her family had run up debts they could not pay. They were sold into slavery. Her father and
two brothers had already been sold. The mother was being taken away by her new owners and Rhoda was
objecting. Loudly. And violently
SALOME: I don’t imagine that went over well
HOSTESS MARY: (becoming more serious) No. They started beating her. John Mark stepped in. He told
them damaged property would bring them less money and offered 5 pieces of silver for her. They agreed almost
too swiftly. (With a soft chuckle) He joked later that he probably could have been paid by them to take her
away.
SALOME: She seems to have adjusted to her new life.

HOSTESS MARY: (With a smile) Yes and the scratches on John Mark have faded away.
MOTHER MARY: (Entering and pulling the hood from her head) Shalom.
HOSTESS MARY: (Greeting her with a hug, followed by SALOME hugging her) Shalom. I was hoping you
would come.
SALOME: (With concern) But it’s so late. It’s dangerous after dark for a woman to walk alone in the streets.
MOTHER MARY: I wasn’t alone. I came with Salome and John. He has become another son to me. He’s seen
Peter. Herod has him under heavy guard. Four squads of four soldiers each. John had no chance to speak to
him. How can I help?
HOSTESS MARY: Sit and rest a while first. Then I suppose we’ll need more bread. And these fish need to go
out to the courtyard to be grilled.
SALOME: I can do that. I saw the fire in the courtyard on my way in. (She takes the fish and a long fork and
exits)
HOSTESS MARY: I can’t believe how hard this must be for her… James being beheaded. Her other son
arrested.
MOTHER MARY: Yes. She grieves. She is having difficulty accepting the fact that God allowed her son James
to die. She asks why he was not freed by an angel like John and Peter when the Sanhedrin had them jailed. Why
not just a flogging?
HOSTESS MARY: Do you think she has accepted that this will not be an earthly kingdom? That John will not
become a ruler? Being a mother is not easy in these times. (glances at Mary and obviously stiffens as she
realizes what she has said to whom)
MOTHER MARY: It’s alright. I knew and accepted my son Jesus’ death long before it happened. It didn’t
make it any easier to watch. But I was somewhat prepared. Salome was not.
HOSTESS MARY: I can personally understand that. John Mark has been drawing attention to himself lately. I
worry. As a Christian I know I must accept God’s will. But it is hard to understand why he protects some and
not the others. Isn’t there another way? Besides, the Lord said whatever we asked for in prayer would be
granted. We prayed for James. Do you think it was because we did not believe?
MOTHER MARY: His ways are higher than ours. He is beyond understanding. Remember Jesus said “blessed
are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” Trials will come
and some will fall away like seed scattered on rocks.
HOSTESS MARY: Perhaps. It is so hard to know. What is a trial? What is a test? What is God’s will?
RHODA: (entering) Salome said to tell you the fish are on. Can I tend them?
HOSTESS MARY: Yes, but be careful. Don’t burn yourself.

RHODA: I’ll be careful. (exits)
MOTHER MARY: John Mark is becoming a fine young man. You must be proud of him.
HOSTESS MARY: (Strained and worried) I fear for him. He speaks out. (Salome re-enters) He has upset
many of the Jewish leaders. Not just what he says, although teaching the resurrection is inflammatory enough.
They think him disrespectful because of his age.
MOTHER MARY: If he’s young and rash he will outgrow it. If he speaks by the power of God, then he must
speak no matter how young he is. Jesus was only twelve when he began challenging the elders.
HOSTESS MARY: (To Mary mother of Jesus) Yes, but your son was the son of God.
MOTHER MARY: Every believer is a child of God.
RHODA: (Bursting in). I need more towels.
HOSTESS MARY: Did you leave the fish to burn?
RHODA: No. Some woman is tending them. She told me to get more towels for washing their feet. I must
have washed ten thousand feet already and they just keep coming. I hate washing feet. They’re dirty. They
stink. (SALOME enters)
HOSTESS MARY: (Reprimanding) It’s the job that falls to the youngest servant.
RHODA: But I hate it. Can’t someone else at least help me?
MOTHER MARY: Yes. I’ll go help you.

(Reaches a hand to Rhoda)

HOSTESS MARY: No, Mary. Not you. You’re an honored guest. The mother of our Lord.

MOTHER MARY: I insist. My son washed feet, even the feet of the one who betrayed him. Furthermore we
are taught that the greatest shall be the least and the servant of all. (takes Rhoda’s hand and they exit)
SALOME: She is an amazing woman. I can see why God chose her to mother his son.
HOSTESS MARY: Yes, it would take a remarkable woman.
(MARY MAGDELA enters carrying a covered basket)
MARY MAGDELA: (With a touch of drama) Greetings. A blessing upon this house. (Removes her head
covering which has hidden her face)
SALOME: Mary! (They hug, turning to HOSTESS MARY) This is Mary Magdela.
HOSTESS MARY: (Taken aback, a bit fearful) Yes. Of course. (Not going to greet her) The one .... I have
heard of you but we have never met. (finally stepping forward gingerly to take the basket MAGDELA proffers)
Greetings in the name of our Lord. (Steps back quickly)
MARY MAGDELA: Can I help? (Picks up a knife, thumps it into some cheese, staring at HOSTESS MARY
who draws back obviously frightened. SALOME stifles a giggle)
SALOME: Mary, it’s alright. She won’t hurt you or anything. (To MARY MAGDELA) I think Mary has heard
about the seven demons (HOSTESS MARY recovers)
HOSTESS MARY: (Chagrined) I am sorry. Please forgive me. I know Jesus cast them out. I just...
MARY MAGDELA: (Laughing) There is nothing to forgive. I have suffered far worse from others. And
sometimes it suits me to be given wide berth. Especially with the Romans and Herod’s soldiers and even our
own priests ready to persecute those of us who follow the Way. (JOANNA enters)
HOSTESS MARY: Welcome. This is Joanna. Her husband Cuza manages Herod’s household. (Women greet
each other)
MARY MAGDELA: (Adamantly with obvious disgust) Herod. That fox.
JOANNA: He is exactly that. (nodding, turning to MARY MAGDELA) I recognize you, now. You were at the
crucifixion and at the tomb.
MARY MAGDELA: I was the one who stayed behind and thought Jesus a gardener. I begged him to tell me

where the body was. (shaking her head at her own stupidity) After all the times I listened to Jesus speak, all the
times I watched him heal and cast out demons, I still had no clue. Then suddenly Jesus himself was there.
SALOME: But when you returned to us the men said you were talking nonsense. Peter and John finally decided
to see for themselves but the rest wrote you off as a hysterical female. (MOTHER MARY re-enters)
MARY MAGDELA: (chuckling) Maybe they thought the demons had come back. (getting serious for once and
turning to MOTHER MARY) Mary, You didn’t go to the tomb that morning. I always wanted to ask you about
that. Why did you stay behind?
MOTHER MARY: Because I knew Jesus wouldn’t be there.
HOSTESS MARY: How could you know that? You watched him die with your own 
MOTHER MARY: Yes I watched, not just on Calvary, but all 33 years of his life. I knew before he performed
his first miracle that he could and would.
MARY MAGDELA: (quietly amazed) That’s right. You coaxed him into turning water into wine at the wedding
in Cana.
MOTHER MARY: I knew he would rise again. That was the only thing that kept me from a total breakdown.
But even knowing he would rise, it was terrible. (MOTHER MARY falls silent, SALOME embraces her, MARY
MAGDELA places a hand on her shoulder)
HOSTESS MARY: Sons are a joy to a mother. But they are also the needle that pierces our hearts.
MOTHER MARY: Sometimes it is a sword - Simeon prophesied that a sword would pierce my heart and he
was right.
RHODA: (bursting in) Someone else is here. A man and his sisters. They came all the way from Bethany! They
brought all kinds of food too. A donkey load! They must be rich!
HOSTESS MARY: That would be Lazarus, Mary and Martha.
RHODA: Another Mary! I don’t think I can keep a 4th Mary straight.
MARY MAGDELA: You won’t have to. Mary won’t be in to help. She’ll be praying with the others. But we
can count on Martha’s help. (Chuckling) She truly has a servant’s heart but I suggest we all get busy or she’ll
assign us things to do. (To HOSTESS MARY) She tends to take charge.

HOSTESS MARY: (Not understanding) But this is my house. Would she take charge in someone else’s house?
ALL: Yes.
MARY MAGDELA: I’ll check the fish. I wouldn’t want Martha to find me sitting around. (The women all
smile as she exits and they get back to work)
SALOME: I’ll help (she exits as well)
RHODA: (Amazed at all the activity) How many more people are coming? The house is about to overflow with
people.
MOTHER MARY: There were 120 of us gathered in that upper room right after Jesus ascended from the Mount
of Olives.
RHODA: (Incredulous) 120! In one room! We’ll never fit 120!
JOANNA: I am concerned about too large a group. Cuza, that’s my husband, says Herod is targeting the
Christians. People will notice a large gathering. They’ll talk. It’s just not safe anywhere. After what happened
to 
HOSTESS MARY: When the Sanhedrin put John and Peter in prison, God sent an angel to release them. Do
you think he will do the same again?
MOTHER MARY: I do not know. Peter’s fate is in God’s hands. We aren’t called to understand or agree. We
are called to submit.
HOSTESS MARY: It is hard being a woman. We have no status. We have no power. All we can do is wait
and watch.
MOTHER MARY: We women can serve. We can pray.
HOSTESS MARY: Yes. Prayer is a powerful force.
MOTHER MARY: And we have many gathered here to pray: The bread and fish are baking. While we wait for
them shall we add our prayers, here in the kitchen? God hears kitchen prayers as well as those in the synagogue.
(The other women nod. Each woman prays in turn, first praising God, then humbling themselves, then for
Peter, and finally other Christians undergoing persecution. At end they all bow their heads for private prayer.

NARRATOR: A record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ the son of David, the son of Abraham:
Abraham was the father of Isaac, whose mother was Sarah
Insert Sarah monologue
SARAH: I was old and well advanced in years when three guests showed up at my husband Abraham’s
tent. One said “About this time next year Sarah will have a son." I was past the age of childbearing so I
laughed to myself thinking, "After I am worn out and my master is old, will I now have this pleasure?"
But nothing is impossible with God. The Lord was gracious and brought me laughter. I, at ninety years
of age, became pregnant and bore a son.
NARRATOR: Isaac was the father of Jacob, whose mother was Rebekah
Insert Rebekah monologue
REBEKAH: I grew up in the town of Nahor, but was married to a man almost 500 miles away. Once I
left home I knew I would never return. As I left, they blessed me saying
"Our sister, may you increase
to thousands upon thousands;
may your offspring possess
the gates of their enemies."
But it seemed like it would never happen. For twenty years we tried to have children. It wasn’t until my
husband Isaac prayed that I became pregnant. I had twins, Jacob and Esau.

But things were still not easy for me. The boys did not get along. The older one was godless, marrying
disgusting Hittite women. He held a grudge against Jacob and consoled himself with thoughts of
murdering him. I did not want to lose both in one day, like Eve did when Cain killed Abel. So I sent
Jacob away for 20 long years. Yet I managed because nothing is impossible with God.
NARRATOR: Jacob was the father of Levi and Judah and their brothers, Leah and Rachel were his wives
Insert Leah monologue based on Genesis 29-31.
LEAH: Do you have any idea what it’s like to never measure up? To try your best but always fall short?
To live in your sister’s shadow your entire life?
I do.
All the while growing up I was second best to my younger sister Rachel. She was the beautiful one. She
was the beloved one. She was the one Jacob asked to marry and gladly worked for seven long years to
have her. And for seven long years I was unloved, unwanted, (Agonized Sniffle) unchosen by anyone.
(Crying)
My father despaired of ever being rid of me, so he devised a plan, a plan to trick Jacob into marrying me
so he could be rid of me, his daughter, the one who never quite measured up. (wipes away tears)
When God saw that I was not loved, he opened my womb. (hopeful) I gave birth to a son and named him
Reuben, thinking, surely my husband will love me now. (hopes dashed) But he did not.
I conceived again, and gave birth to Simeon. (hopeful) I thought “the LORD heard that I am not loved,
so he gave me this one too." (happy) And after Levi was born I thought, "Now at last my husband will
become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons."
(hopes dashed) But he did not. Not after four. Not after five. (Crying) After my sixth, Zebulon was born
I thought, "God has presented me with a precious gift. (slightly hopeful) This time my husband will treat
me with honor, because I have borne him six sons.
But he did not. (Through tears) I gave him a daughter. (with heart wrenching desperation) I gave him
everything I could but it still wasn’t enough.
Was I ever loved? Ever chosen? Yes, because nothing is impossible with God. The Lord does not judge
by outward appearance but by the heart. And the Lord chose me to be the mother of Judah, from whom
the kings of his people and the Messiah descended. The Lord chose me to be the mother of Levi, from
whom the priesthood descended.
NARRATOR: Levi was the father of Kohath
Kohath was the father of Amram
Amram, who was married to Jocabed, was the father of
Aaron, Moses and Miriam.

Insert skit about Midwives and Moses
PHARAOH ‘S WIFE (Concerned) These Israelites are multiplying faster than flies. No, not flies. Flies
are an annoyance. They multiply like locusts. Swarms of locusts that will descend on Egypt and eat our
crops and leave us to starve.
(Heartlessly to unseen minions) Use them ruthlessly. Use them up. Make their lives bitter with hard
labor. Let them build store cities for you, (with pride) the Pharaoh, the most powerful man in all of
Egypt. No, in the entire world.
PHARAOH: Let it be so.
SHIPHRAH: (Leaning towards audience as if drawing them into her confidence to share a secret)
Pharaoh has decided that when I help Hebrew women in childbirth I should kill the boys; but if it is a girl,
let her live. What kind of a monster is he? Is it not enough that we toil under the sun, building his cities
and pyramids? Is it not enough that the whip lashes us like we are cattle? Must he take away our only
joy, our precious children as well?
(Drawing herself up straight, firm in her conviction) I am Shiphrah, Hebrew midwife, not Shiphrah,
assassin for the Egyptians. They may force me to cook their food, wash their feet, accept their blows but
they will never force me to kill the babies of my sisters, my friends, my daughters.
Never! (Looking up and to the right at the Pharaoh) Do you hear me Pharaoh? (Raising her fist)
NEVER!
PHARAOH’S WIFE: (Exasperated to audience) No matter what we do, the Hebrews multiple like rats
and if we are not careful like rats they will gnaw away at Egypt until there is nothing left but these
accursed Hebrews! The more we oppress them, the more they spread. If war breaks out, those Hebrews
will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country. (hands on hips) That must not happen.
(Slyly) But do not kill them. No, they are far too useful as slave labor. (To unseen minions) Use the men
ruthlessly. Use them up. Wear them out. Make them unable to raise their fists against us. (Walking over
to stand above the seated Puah who appears to be cowering) When they give birth, kill the boys but keep
the girls alive to serve us. (Laughs at her own cleverness)
PHARAOH: Let it be so.
PUAH: (Some Outrage, some sarcasm) I have new orders; despicable orders. (Stands, looks around to
make sure she is not overheard and directly to the audience, imitating the voice of Pharaoh’s wife) Every
boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live. (Switches to own voice) Those are
the new orders.
The old orders weren’t being obeyed so now we have the new orders. (Mocking the voice of Pharaoh’s
wife) “Throw those babies in the river”. So the crocodiles can feed on Hebrew flesh and blood? I think
not. Do they think we fear them so much we would stand by, watching a helpless baby be swallowed by
the Nile? I think not.

I may only be a slave. (With as much pride as Pharaoh’s wife had) But I am a Hebrew slave. I may be
beaten, even killed for disobeying. But I, Puah the midwife, will not obey the Pharaoh. (Resumes her
position on the floor as if she is cowering and afraid)
NARRATOR: God was kind to the midwives. Because the midwives feared God, he gave them families
of their own
JOCABED: What shall I do? Pharaoh has decreed that boy babies be thrown into the Nile. But this child
of mine, this precious baby boy, is no ordinary child. Miriam, we will hide your baby brother.

MIRIAM: I’ll help. (Freeze for two beats to show the passage of time)
JOCABED: We have hidden him for three months but we can do so no longer. God must protect him
now. Get me a papyrus basket. We’ll coat it with tar and pitch. That will make the basket waterproof so
when I place him in the Nile, he won’t drown.
MIRIAM: Mama! Those crocodiles will eat him or the basket will tip and he’ll drown.
JOCABED: Nothing is impossible with God, my child. Let us wait and watch and see what God will do.
MIRIAM: I’ll stand at a distance to see what happens to him when you put him in the water.
Pharaoh’s daughter and her maids enter. Pharaoh’s daughter points to the basket.
PHARAOH’s DAUGHTER: Fetch me the basket.
MAID 1 gets the basket and brings it to her.
PHARAOH’s DAUGHTER: (opening the basket) it’s one of the little Hebrew babies. He’s crying. (She
lifts him out) I think I will keep him and adopt him as my son. I will call him Moses because I drew him
out of the water.
MIRIAM: Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?
PHARAOH’S DAUGHTER: Yes, go.
MIRIAM: Mama, Pharaoh’s daughter is going to adopt him. God saved our baby. It is just as you said –
nothing is impossible with God.
JOCABED goes to and bows before PHARAOH’s DAUGHTER
PHARAOH’S DAUGHTER: Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.
JOCABED: (to audience) So I took my baby and nursed him. When Moses grew older, I took him to
Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. But he never forgot who he really was. By faith, when he had

grown up, he refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter. He chose to be mistreated along with
the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time. By faith he left Egypt, not
fearing the king's anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible. The LORD would speak to
my Moses face to face, as a man speaks with his friend. He led our people to freedom because (with
MIRIAM) nothing is impossible with God.
NARRATOR: Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar, who after being
widowed twice, risked her life to have those children
Insert Tamar monologue
TAMAR: Judah’s son Er married me. But he was wicked in the LORD's sight; so the LORD put him to
death. His brother Onan treated me badly and the Lord also put him to death. Widowed twice, I was
banished to my father’s house rather than wed to the youngest son, Shelah because Judah was afraid he
might die too.
I could have died alone and childless but with God nothing is impossible. He was with me when I risked
my life to become a mother and because I was more righteous than Judah, he blessed me with twins.
NARRATOR:
Perez was the father of Hezron,
Hezron the father of Ram,
Ram the father of Amminadab,
Amminadab the father of Nahshon,
Nahshon the father of Salmon,
Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab, the prostitute of Jericho
Insert Rahab monologue
A: Mommy, mommy. Tell us the story of how you became an Israelite.
RAHAB: One day some men from Israel came to my house. The king of Jericho found out and
commanded me to bring them out because they have come to spy out the whole land.
I said, yes, they were here. I had no idea where they came from. I’m a prostitute, not border patrol. At
dusk, when it was time to close the city gate, the men left. I don't know which way they went. Go after
them quickly. You may catch up with them.
I had hidden the men on the roof and spread flax over them to hide them. And then I told them how they
could repay me. I said….
I know that the LORD has given this land to you and that a great fear of you has fallen on us, so that all
who live in this country are melting in fear because of you. We have heard how the LORD dried up the
water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and that you completely destroyed Sihon and

Og, the two kings of the Amorites. When we heard of it, our hearts melted and everyone's courage failed
because of you, for the LORD your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below. Now then,
please swear to me by the LORD that you will show kindness to my family, because I have shown
kindness to you. Give me a sure sign that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers
and sisters, and all who belong to them, and that you will save us from death.
Then the spies said “Our lives for your lives! If you don't tell what we are doing, we will treat you kindly
and faithfully when the LORD gives us the land. Just make sure this scarlet cord is hanging from the
window.”
The next day I let them down by a rope through the window. My house was part of the city wall. I told
them to hide in the hills for three days until the men sent to hunt them down returned.
The king shut the city gates so no one went out and no one came in. I gathered my whole family in my
house. For six days all the Israelites did was march once around the city, carrying this golden box. Can
you guess what the box was?
A: The Ark of the Covenant.
RAHAB: That’s right. I was not easy keeping everybody inside. Your grandmother wanted to go home
and one of the cousin’s thought we were being stupid, having a scarlet cord hanging out the window like
laundry drying. On the 7th day, the Israelites marched around 7 times, shouted, blew their trumpets. We
felt a rumble, then all around us the walls were falling. The army marched in and took over but the two
young men who I hid brought me, my parents, brothers and all who belonged to me to a place of safety
outside their camp. You know why we were saved?
A: Faith
RAHAB: Yes, but a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone. Even though I knew the
LORD our God is God in heaven above and on the earth below, I had to act on my belief and save the
spies.
A: But mommy, how could the city walls fall down with just shouts and trumpets?
RAHAB: Nothing is impossible with God.
NARRATOR: Boaz was the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth, who was widowed, barren and yet
went to a foreign land.
Insert Ruth Monologue
NAOMI: (to Ruth and Orpah) My daughters go back, each of you, to your mother's home.
ORPAH: We will go back with you to your people.
NAOMI: Return home; I am too old to have another husband or more sons.

ORPAH: Alright (exits)
RUTH: Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay
I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there I
will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you
and me.
NAOMI: Then to Bethlehem we go.
WOMAN: (RAHAB): Can this be Naomi?
NAOMI: Don't call me Naomi. Call me Mara, because my life is very bitter. I went away full, but have
come back empty. I am a widow, my two sons are dead. I have no land, no home. All I have is my
daughter in law Ruth and she’s not in much better shape. She’s a widow too, unable to have children and
a foreigner who must pick up leftover barely wherever she can so the two of us don’t starve to death.
RUTH: Don’t despair. For nothing is impossible with God. (to audience) God richly blessed me for
choosing him over the gods of Moab. He blessed me with a kind hearted husband, a son and a greatgrandson, David, who faced Goliath, knowing that nothing was impossible with God.
NARRATOR: Obed was the father of Jesse,
and Jesse the father of King David,
DAVID: Goliath, I come against you in the name of the LORD Almighty, and the whole world will know
that there is a God in Israel. All those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the
LORD saves; for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give all of you into our hands. Nothing is
impossible with God.
NARRATOR: David was the father of Solomon, whose mother had been Uriah's wife,
Insert Bathsheba monologue
BATHSHEBA: Do you think it impossible to be forgiven? It is not. Some people tease me, Bathsheba,
that I’m not the sharpest tool in the shed. They joke that I couldn’t find sand if I fell off a camel. I am
rather naive. I almost cost my son Solomon his kingdom by asking a favor for his elder brother. I’m glad
Solomon saw through his brother’s trickery, when he asked to marry Abishag. I didn’t see the harm in it.
But, like I said, I’m not the sharpest tool in the shed.
I shouldn’t have been bathing on my rooftop where David could see me. But once he summoned me to
the palace, what could I do? Even God compared me to a little lamb, a pawn, when he sent Nathan to
confront David with his sin
I paid a steep price for my adultery. I became pregnant out of wedlock. My husband died, murdered
because he was a noble man. The child I carried died as well, breaking my heart.

Yet God is a merciful God. He forgives. I had other children, four of them. One was Solomon, the man
God blessed with wisdom.

NARRATOR: Solomon's son was Rehoboam,
Abijah his son,
Asa his son,
Jehoshaphat his son,
Jehoram his son, who married Athaliah,
Ahaziah his son,
Joash his son who was saved by his Aunt Jehosheba
Insert Athaliah skit
JEHOSHEBA: Mother, I bring bad news. Your son King Ahaziah has been killed in battle.
ATHALIAH: Then I shall rule in his place. Guards – find and kill my grandsons, every last one of them.
JEHOSHEBA: Kill all the grandsons. But why, mother?
ATHALIAH: Do you think I don’t have the nerve or the strength? I come from a long line of ruthless
rulers and strong women. My grandfather, Omri, did not let anyone stand between him and a throne. His
son Ahab, married Jezebel who was a strong woman. She killed off all the Lord’s prophets she could
find. When Naboth would not sell his vineyard, she wrote letters in Ahab’s name and had him killed. I’m
every bit as strong as her.
When my husband and your father Jehoram became king, he put all his brothers to death so there would
be no one to challenge him. Now be off, I have a throne to claim. Guards – find and kill my grandsons.
JEHOSHEBA: (stage whisper, secretive) Nurse, bring baby Joash and come with me. I will hide you
both and save his life.
NURSE: (Afraid) Your mother will find out. We can’t hide from her.
JEHOSHEBA: Nothing is impossible with God. (to audience) And I, with God’s help, hid the baby who
was rightfully king in the temple of the Lord for seven years. And he did become king. Queen Athaliah
thought herself strong because she wasn’t afraid to take lives. I know I am strong because I wasn’t afraid
to save a life, though it meant risking my own.
NARRATOR: Joash’s son Amaziah fathered kings and exiles and eventually a child born to Mary.
GABRIEL: Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.

MARY: (Troubled) What kind of greeting is this?
GABRIEL: Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God. You will be with child and give
birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the
Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of
Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end.
MARY: How will this be since I am a virgin?
GABRIEL: The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.
So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God. For nothing is impossible with God.
MARY: I am the Lord's servant. May it be to me as you have said.
And it was as he said. But it was not easy. My betrothed Joseph sought to divorce me. I had to make a
long journey in the final days of my pregnancy and gave birth in a stable. But we managed, for nothing is
impossible with God.
On the 8th day we circumcised our son, offering two doves instead of a lamb. A poor man’s offering.
Then Magi from the east presented us with the most valuable, easily transported gifts. The timing was
perfect. As in the time of Moses, a ruler sought to kill all the male children. Herod wanted no rivals. And
we escaped to Egypt because nothing is impossible with God.
Simeon had warned me my heart would be pierced as with a sword. And it was. I had to watch as my son
was beaten past recognition, mocked and hung to die on a Roman cross. Buried in a borrowed grave.
How could I as a mother endure it? Nothing is impossible with God.
All the women gather behind and around the NARRATOR in a semi circle. As the NARRATOR closes,
each woman to whom the narrator refers, steps forward each time her circumstance is mentioned, then

NARRATOR: Throughout the ages, women have faced impossible circumstances – barrenness,
widowhood, sometimes multiple times. They have endured the death of their children. Being unloved,
rejected, second best.
They have faced down cruel and oppressive regimes and ruler and defied ungodly laws. They risked their
own lives to save a child’s. They have left home and family. Some faced squarely their own sin and
shame in order to turn from their old way of life to a life in God.
Women have faced uncertain circumstances and fresh pain with honor and nobility. And yet we women
endure because…

NARRATOR: A record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ the son of David, the son of Abraham:
Abraham was the father of Isaac, whose mother was Sarah
Insert Sarah monologue
SARAH: I was old and well advanced in years when three guests showed up at my husband Abraham’s
tent. One said “About this time next year Sarah will have a son." I was past the age of childbearing so I
laughed to myself thinking, "After I am worn out and my master is old, will I now have this pleasure?"
But nothing is impossible with God. The Lord was gracious and brought me laughter. I, at ninety years
of age, became pregnant and bore a son.
NARRATOR: Isaac was the father of Jacob, whose mother was Rebekah
Insert Rebekah monologue
REBEKAH: I grew up in the town of Nahor, but was married to a man almost 500 miles away. Once I
left home I knew I would never return. As I left, they blessed me saying
"Our sister, may you increase
to thousands upon thousands;
may your offspring possess
the gates of their enemies."
But it seemed like it would never happen. For twenty years we tried to have children. It wasn’t until my
husband Isaac prayed that I became pregnant. I had twins, Jacob and Esau.

But things were still not easy for me. The boys did not get along. The older one was godless, marrying
disgusting Hittite women. He held a grudge against Jacob and consoled himself with thoughts of
murdering him. I did not want to lose both in one day, like Eve did when Cain killed Abel. So I sent
Jacob away for 20 long years. Yet I managed because nothing is impossible with God.
NARRATOR: Jacob was the father of Levi and Judah and their brothers, Leah and Rachel were his wives
Insert Leah monologue based on Genesis 29-31.
LEAH: Do you have any idea what it’s like to never measure up? To try your best but always fall short?
To live in your sister’s shadow your entire life?
I do.
All the while growing up I was second best to my younger sister Rachel. She was the beautiful one. She
was the beloved one. She was the one Jacob asked to marry and gladly worked for seven long years to
have her. And for seven long years I was unloved, unwanted, (Agonized Sniffle) unchosen by anyone.
(Crying)
My father despaired of ever being rid of me, so he devised a plan, a plan to trick Jacob into marrying me
so he could be rid of me, his daughter, the one who never quite measured up. (wipes away tears)
When God saw that I was not loved, he opened my womb. (hopeful) I gave birth to a son and named him
Reuben, thinking, surely my husband will love me now. (hopes dashed) But he did not.
I conceived again, and gave birth to Simeon. (hopeful) I thought “the LORD heard that I am not loved,
so he gave me this one too." (happy) And after Levi was born I thought, "Now at last my husband will
become attached to me, because I have borne him three sons."
(hopes dashed) But he did not. Not after four. Not after five. (Crying) After my sixth, Zebulon was born
I thought, "God has presented me with a precious gift. (slightly hopeful) This time my husband will treat
me with honor, because I have borne him six sons.
But he did not. (Through tears) I gave him a daughter. (with heart wrenching desperation) I gave him
everything I could but it still wasn’t enough.
Was I ever loved? Ever chosen? Yes, because nothing is impossible with God. The Lord does not judge
by outward appearance but by the heart. And the Lord chose me to be the mother of Judah, from whom
the kings of his people and the Messiah descended. The Lord chose me to be the mother of Levi, from
whom the priesthood descended.
NARRATOR: Levi was the father of Kohath
Kohath was the father of Amram
Amram, who was married to Jocabed, was the father of
Aaron, Moses and Miriam.

Insert skit about Midwives and Moses
PHARAOH ‘S WIFE (Concerned) These Israelites are multiplying faster than flies. No, not flies. Flies
are an annoyance. They multiply like locusts. Swarms of locusts that will descend on Egypt and eat our
crops and leave us to starve.
(Heartlessly to unseen minions) Use them ruthlessly. Use them up. Make their lives bitter with hard
labor. Let them build store cities for you, (with pride) the Pharaoh, the most powerful man in all of
Egypt. No, in the entire world.
PHARAOH: Let it be so.
SHIPHRAH: (Leaning towards audience as if drawing them into her confidence to share a secret)
Pharaoh has decided that when I help Hebrew women in childbirth I should kill the boys; but if it is a girl,
let her live. What kind of a monster is he? Is it not enough that we toil under the sun, building his cities
and pyramids? Is it not enough that the whip lashes us like we are cattle? Must he take away our only
joy, our precious children as well?
(Drawing herself up straight, firm in her conviction) I am Shiphrah, Hebrew midwife, not Shiphrah,
assassin for the Egyptians. They may force me to cook their food, wash their feet, accept their blows but
they will never force me to kill the babies of my sisters, my friends, my daughters.
Never! (Looking up and to the right at the Pharaoh) Do you hear me Pharaoh? (Raising her fist)
NEVER!
PHARAOH’S WIFE: (Exasperated to audience) No matter what we do, the Hebrews multiple like rats
and if we are not careful like rats they will gnaw away at Egypt until there is nothing left but these
accursed Hebrews! The more we oppress them, the more they spread. If war breaks out, those Hebrews
will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country. (hands on hips) That must not happen.
(Slyly) But do not kill them. No, they are far too useful as slave labor. (To unseen minions) Use the men
ruthlessly. Use them up. Wear them out. Make them unable to raise their fists against us. (Walking over
to stand above the seated Puah who appears to be cowering) When they give birth, kill the boys but keep
the girls alive to serve us. (Laughs at her own cleverness)
PHARAOH: Let it be so.
PUAH: (Some Outrage, some sarcasm) I have new orders; despicable orders. (Stands, looks around to
make sure she is not overheard and directly to the audience, imitating the voice of Pharaoh’s wife) Every
boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live. (Switches to own voice) Those are
the new orders.
The old orders weren’t being obeyed so now we have the new orders. (Mocking the voice of Pharaoh’s
wife) “Throw those babies in the river”. So the crocodiles can feed on Hebrew flesh and blood? I think
not. Do they think we fear them so much we would stand by, watching a helpless baby be swallowed by
the Nile? I think not.

I may only be a slave. (With as much pride as Pharaoh’s wife had) But I am a Hebrew slave. I may be
beaten, even killed for disobeying. But I, Puah the midwife, will not obey the Pharaoh. (Resumes her
position on the floor as if she is cowering and afraid)
NARRATOR: God was kind to the midwives. Because the midwives feared God, he gave them families
of their own
JOCABED: What shall I do? Pharaoh has decreed that boy babies be thrown into the Nile. But this child
of mine, this precious baby boy, is no ordinary child. Miriam, we will hide your baby brother.

MIRIAM: I’ll help. (Freeze for two beats to show the passage of time)
JOCABED: We have hidden him for three months but we can do so no longer. God must protect him
now. Get me a papyrus basket. We’ll coat it with tar and pitch. That will make the basket waterproof so
when I place him in the Nile, he won’t drown.
MIRIAM: Mama! Those crocodiles will eat him or the basket will tip and he’ll drown.
JOCABED: Nothing is impossible with God, my child. Let us wait and watch and see what God will do.
MIRIAM: I’ll stand at a distance to see what happens to him when you put him in the water.
Pharaoh’s daughter and her maids enter. Pharaoh’s daughter points to the basket.
PHARAOH’s DAUGHTER: Fetch me the basket.
MAID 1 gets the basket and brings it to her.
PHARAOH’s DAUGHTER: (opening the basket) it’s one of the little Hebrew babies. He’s crying. (She
lifts him out) I think I will keep him and adopt him as my son. I will call him Moses because I drew him
out of the water.
MIRIAM: Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?
PHARAOH’S DAUGHTER: Yes, go.
MIRIAM: Mama, Pharaoh’s daughter is going to adopt him. God saved our baby. It is just as you said –
nothing is impossible with God.
JOCABED goes to and bows before PHARAOH’s DAUGHTER
PHARAOH’S DAUGHTER: Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.
JOCABED: (to audience) So I took my baby and nursed him. When Moses grew older, I took him to
Pharaoh's daughter and he became her son. But he never forgot who he really was. By faith, when he had

grown up, he refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter. He chose to be mistreated along with
the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time. By faith he left Egypt, not
fearing the king's anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible. The LORD would speak to
my Moses face to face, as a man speaks with his friend. He led our people to freedom because (with
MIRIAM) nothing is impossible with God.
NARRATOR: Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar, who after being
widowed twice, risked her life to have those children
Insert Tamar monologue
TAMAR: Judah’s son Er married me. But he was wicked in the LORD's sight; so the LORD put him to
death. His brother Onan treated me badly and the Lord also put him to death. Widowed twice, I was
banished to my father’s house rather than wed to the youngest son, Shelah because Judah was afraid he
might die too.
I could have died alone and childless but with God nothing is impossible. He was with me when I risked
my life to become a mother and because I was more righteous than Judah, he blessed me with twins.
NARRATOR:
Perez was the father of Hezron,
Hezron the father of Ram,
Ram the father of Amminadab,
Amminadab the father of Nahshon,
Nahshon the father of Salmon,
Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab, the prostitute of Jericho
Insert Rahab monologue
A: Mommy, mommy. Tell us the story of how you became an Israelite.
RAHAB: One day some men from Israel came to my house. The king of Jericho found out and
commanded me to bring them out because they have come to spy out the whole land.
I said, yes, they were here. I had no idea where they came from. I’m a prostitute, not border patrol. At
dusk, when it was time to close the city gate, the men left. I don't know which way they went. Go after
them quickly. You may catch up with them.
I had hidden the men on the roof and spread flax over them to hide them. And then I told them how they
could repay me. I said….
I know that the LORD has given this land to you and that a great fear of you has fallen on us, so that all
who live in this country are melting in fear because of you. We have heard how the LORD dried up the
water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and that you completely destroyed Sihon and

Og, the two kings of the Amorites. When we heard of it, our hearts melted and everyone's courage failed
because of you, for the LORD your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below. Now then,
please swear to me by the LORD that you will show kindness to my family, because I have shown
kindness to you. Give me a sure sign that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers
and sisters, and all who belong to them, and that you will save us from death.
Then the spies said “Our lives for your lives! If you don't tell what we are doing, we will treat you kindly
and faithfully when the LORD gives us the land. Just make sure this scarlet cord is hanging from the
window.”
The next day I let them down by a rope through the window. My house was part of the city wall. I told
them to hide in the hills for three days until the men sent to hunt them down returned.
The king shut the city gates so no one went out and no one came in. I gathered my whole family in my
house. For six days all the Israelites did was march once around the city, carrying this golden box. Can
you guess what the box was?
A: The Ark of the Covenant.
RAHAB: That’s right. I was not easy keeping everybody inside. Your grandmother wanted to go home
and one of the cousin’s thought we were being stupid, having a scarlet cord hanging out the window like
laundry drying. On the 7th day, the Israelites marched around 7 times, shouted, blew their trumpets. We
felt a rumble, then all around us the walls were falling. The army marched in and took over but the two
young men who I hid brought me, my parents, brothers and all who belonged to me to a place of safety
outside their camp. You know why we were saved?
A: Faith
RAHAB: Yes, but a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone. Even though I knew the
LORD our God is God in heaven above and on the earth below, I had to act on my belief and save the
spies.
A: But mommy, how could the city walls fall down with just shouts and trumpets?
RAHAB: Nothing is impossible with God.
NARRATOR: Boaz was the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth, who was widowed, barren and yet
went to a foreign land.
Insert Ruth Monologue
NAOMI: (to Ruth and Orpah) My daughters go back, each of you, to your mother's home.
ORPAH: We will go back with you to your people.
NAOMI: Return home; I am too old to have another husband or more sons.

ORPAH: Alright (exits)
RUTH: Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay
I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there I
will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you
and me.
NAOMI: Then to Bethlehem we go.
WOMAN: (RAHAB): Can this be Naomi?
NAOMI: Don't call me Naomi. Call me Mara, because my life is very bitter. I went away full, but have
come back empty. I am a widow, my two sons are dead. I have no land, no home. All I have is my
daughter in law Ruth and she’s not in much better shape. She’s a widow too, unable to have children and
a foreigner who must pick up leftover barely wherever she can so the two of us don’t starve to death.

Technically a monologue since there is only one speaker. The other, silent person needs to have 4 sets
of bandages - Strips about 4-6 inches wide. One will need to be 3 feet long; the other three can be 18
inches long. You can use toilet paper possibly for the bandages if the audience is far enough away and
you are careful when you handle it.
(Voice changes as child grows older. It is important for the voice tone only to change. Use the exact
same wording over and over for greatest impact. Mocking voice must be deeper than any other voice
used)
(Voice tone, mannerisms are that of a 5 year old) My father is no fun. He makes up all these rules
just so I don't have any fun. He said, (Change voice to indicate you are mocking father) "Don't
play with matches." (Back to child’s voice) That's a really dumb rule. (More enthusiastic) Fire's
so cool so when Tommy came over we got out some matches and played with them. (With
great enthusiasm) Boy did we have fun.

Don't ride your bike in the road." (Back to child’s voice) Now that’s dumb. Everyone knows
that’s what the road is there for. So me and Tommy went riding our bikes down the road
when my parents weren't looking and Boy, did I have fun.

(Voice tone, mannerisms are that of a 9 year old) My father is no fun. He makes up all these rules,
rules just so I don’t have any fun. My father said, (Change voice to indicate you are mocking
father)" Don't tease the dog next door." (Back to child’s voice) Really dumb rule. It’s allotted
of fun to see how mad we can get that old dog. So one day I climbed over the fence and got
that dog REAL mad. (with less enthusiasm than last time) Boy, did I have fun.

a little sarcasm creep in) What do they think I am, a baby? I'm old enough to play with the
gun myself. So one day while they were at the mall I got out the BB gun.

(Pause. Change voice and posture to indicate an adult) You know, when I was younger I
thought my father made up all of those rules just so I wouldn't have any fun. Sometimes I
thought God wrote the Bible just so I wouldn't have any fun either. (Pause Look at bandages.
Look straight at audience) I think I am beginning to catch on.

MY FATHER
Technically a monologue since there is only one speaker. The other, silent person needs to have 4 sets
of bandages - Strips about 4-6 inches wide. One will need to be 3 feet long; the other three can be 18
inches long. You can use toilet paper possibly for the bandages if the audience is far enough away and
you are careful when you handle it.
(Voice changes as child grows older. It is important for the voice tone only to change. Use the exact
same wording over and over for greatest impact. Mocking voice must be deeper than any other voice
used)
(Voice tone, mannerisms are that of a 5 year old) My father is no fun. He makes up all these rules
just so I don't have any fun. He said, (Change voice to indicate you are mocking father) "Don't
play with matches." (Back to child’s voice) That's a really dumb rule. (More enthusiastic) Fire's
so cool so when Tommy came over we got out some matches and played with them. (With
great enthusiasm) Boy did we have fun.

Scene 1
NARR: People around the globe know December 25th is a celebration of the birth that took place
a long time ago - Jesus, son of Mary. From there, what Christmas means varies from one
family’s traditions to the next, from retailers’ end-of-the year balance sheets to kids anticipating
school breaks to the socialite’s schedule of parties. Christmas carols, cookies and decorations
transcend language, culture and religions.
(Profoundly) But what is the essence of Christmas?
That cannot be answered in an hour or two (lightening considerably)so don’t expect this
production to be some earth shattering, miraculous revelation that once and for all makes the
meaning of Christmas crystal clear. (moves a couple steps stage right)


2
On the other hand. (with a twinkle in the eye) The first Christmas was earth shattering. And
miraculous. (pause) And miraculous, earth shattering things happen to those who believe. Even
to the black sheep in the family of God.
God promised imperfect people a savior, a perfect sacrifice, his own son. He even worked
through imperfect people – the black sheep of the family – to bring the Lamb of God into the
world.
Knowing us and our imperfections well, God also gave ample signs – prophesies – so we would
recognize the Messiah, the promised, perfect one, when he arrived.
Who were these people? These black sheep? What were the prophesies given to these black
sheep that pointed to a perfect lamb?
Among Jesus’ ancestors we find the destitute and a prostitute. Outlaws and in-laws. Many were
children of promise themselves – born in unusual circumstances to unusual people.
Let us start at the beginning.
Lights out.
Scene 2
NARR: The very beginning.
NARR: In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was formless and
empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the
waters. And God said,
VO: Let there be light.
Single diffuse light upon center stage that steadily grows brighter
NARR: And there was light. God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from
the darkness. God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night.
VO: Let us make man in our image.
NARR: So God created man in his own image. (simultaneous video 1)
ADAM: The LORD God put me in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. He created
woman so I would not be alone.


3
EVE: We lived in paradise. We had no idea what pain, suffering or death meant. But it was not
to last. We fell prey to temptation. Sin entered the world and death through sin. The result of
one trespass was condemnation for both us and all who followed.
ADAM: Yet we had hope. God made a promise to us and all the generations that would follow.
VO: I will put enmity
between Satan and the woman,
and between his offspring and hers;
My son, your offspring, will crush Satan’s head. And Satan will bruise his heel.
ADAM: But the promise carried a heavy price. Though God's abundant provision of grace and
of the gift of righteousness would reign through the one man, Jesus Christ. That savior that God
made flesh, would have to die. (ADAM and EVE cross to down center; end video 1)
EVE: Before he could die, he would have to be born.
Yes, the son of God, being in very nature God,
did not consider equality with God something to be grasped or held onto,

ADAM: He would make himself nothing,
taking the very nature of a servant,
being made in human likeness.
And being found in appearance as a man,
he he would humble himself to be born in the flesh.
EVE: Only to become obedient to death, even death on a cross! It was only after I had sons,
only after one killed the other, that I truly understood what death was. Not only that, I also
understood with absolute clarity and absolute agony how much it would cost God to lose his son.
(ADAM and EVE cross back to down right)
Scene 3
NARR: Adam’s son Seth, fathered Enosh, who fathered Kenan, the father of Mahalalel, the
father Jared, the father of Enoch.
ADAM: Enoch walked with God 300 years and was commended as one who pleased God. Then
he was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death. (simultaneous video 2)
EVE: God took him away so he did not have to face the fate of a world grown wicked, corrupt in
God's sight and full of violence. The LORD saw how great man's wickedness on the earth had
become, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time. The
LORD was grieved that he had made man on the earth, and his heart was filled with pain.

4
ADAM: But Noah found favor in the eyes of the LORD. By faith, he and his family were
saved. God told them to be fruitful and multiply, but once again, sinned multiplied as well. (end
video 2)
EVE: Yet one man, Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness, and he
was called God's friend.
Scene 4
VO: Abram, Leave your country, your people and your father's household and go to the land I
will show you.
I will make you into a great nation
and I will bless you;
I will make your name great,
and you will be a blessing.
All peoples on earth
will be blessed through you.
ABRAHAM bows to the voice, ABRAM and SARAH move down center (simultaneous video 3)
SARAH: By faith 75 year old Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as
his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going. By faith he
made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country; (SARAH exits)
ABRAHAM: I lived in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with me of God’s promise.
For I was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and builder is God. (end
video 3)
VO: You will be the father of many nations. No longer will you be called Exalted Father; your
name will be Abraham – meaning father of many. I will make you very fruitful; I will make
nations of you, and kings will come from you.
ABRAHAM: You, O Lord are faithful. You have called me, a mere man, your friend. You are
the God who gives life to the dead and calls things into being that are not as though they were.
This grand, magnificent universe was formed at your command, so that what is seen was not
made out of what was visible.
VO: I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your
descendants after you for the generations to come, to be your God and the God of your
descendants after you
ABRAHAM: I am 90, as good as dead; past the age of fathering children and my wife Sarai is
barren, but you are both faithful and powerful. I know everything you say will come to pass.

5
VO: As for Sarai your wife, I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless
her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her.
Abraham falls face down, and then laughing with delight at what he believes will come to pass,
wipes tears of joy from his eyes as he speaks.
VO: Your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will call him Isaac. I will establish my
covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.
Sarah enters carrying Isaac
ABRAHAM: Now the LORD was gracious to Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did for Sarah
what he had promised. Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to me in my old age, at the very
time God had promised me. I was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
SARAH: God has brought me laughter, and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me.
Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son
in his old age.
Song (SARAH and baby exit, lights out on stage following song)
Scene 5
VO: Abraham!
ABRAHAM: Here I am.
(start simultaneous video 5) VO: Take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go to
the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell
you about.
(Voice Over on video) SARAH: Abraham did not argue or delay. Early the next morning took
our son Isaac and set out. (Isaac enters onstage, Abraham and Isaac prostate on stage)
(VIDEO 5 continued- Abraham and Isaac are building the altar) ISAAC: Father? The fire and
wood are here, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?
ABRAHAM: God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.
Abraham binds Isaac, lays him on altar
ABRAHAM: My son, God has said “It is through Isaac that your offspring will be reckoned.” It
stands to reason that God who created the heavens and the earth from nothing, who formed man
from the dust of the earth, will be able to raise the dead without any trouble. Therefore you will
live, even if you die, so his promises to e will be fulfilled.

6
Abraham raises the knife
VO: Abraham! Abraham!
ABRAHAM: Here I am.
VO: Do not lay a hand on the boy; do not do anything to him. Now I know that you respect and
awe me, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son.
Abraham helps ISSAC up, they embrace. At the sound of God’s voice they fall prostrate. (END
VIDEO 5)
Lights up down center. Abraham and Isaac are prostrate to match end of video. They rise to
their feet during next VO)
VO: I swear by myself that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your
only son, I will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky
and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the cities of their
enemies, and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed, because you have
obeyed me. (Abraham exits, ISAAC moves further downstage)
ISAAC: God provided a ram in my place so from that day forth we called this place The Lord
Will Provide. He would provide not just the ram in my place, but his own son, his only begotten
son, in the place of all mankind.
Perhaps God called my father friend, because in some small way, my father could understand the
pain in God’s heart, the gloom, the agonizing anticipation of sacrificing an only son. (ISAAC
exits)
Scene 6
NARR: Abraham was the father of Isaac,
Isaac the father of Jacob,
Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,
Judah the father of Perez and Zerah, whose mother was Tamar,
(aside) She’s quite a character herself. But another story for another time.
Perez the father of Hezron, (simultaneous video 5)
Hezron the father of Ram,
Ram the father of Amminadab,
Amminadab the father of Nahshon,
Nahshon the father of Salmon,
Salmon the father of Boaz, whose mother was Rahab, (end video 5)

7
RAHAB: A prostitute in the lineage of Jesus? Yes. A prostitute from the city of Jericho. I
and my people had heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea when the children of
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob had come out of Egypt. He had completely destroyed their enemies.
When we heard of it, our hearts melted and everyone's courage failed. So when spies from
Joshua came, I welcomed them, against the direct orders of my king.
SPY 1: The king of Jericho seeks to kill us. Hide us.
RAHAB: I know the Lord your God is God in heaven above and on the earth below. Please
swear to me by the Lord that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and
sisters, and all who belong to them, and that you will save us from death.
SPY 2: Our lives for your lives! If you don't tell what we are doing, we will treat you kindly and
faithfully when the Lord gives us the land.
RAHAB: Agreed; let it be as you say. I will send those who seek your lives on another path and
hide you until the city gates close. After I secret you out my window, go to the hills so the
pursuers will not find you. Hide yourselves there three days until they return, and then go on
your way.
SPY1: Tie this scarlet cord in the window and bring your father and mother, your brothers and
all your family into your house.
SPY 2: But if you tell what we are doing, we will be released from the oath you made us swear.
RAHAB: Could God have saved his spies without my help? Absolutely. But God choses to
work his will through imperfect people. I had faith in the one true God and when he gave me the
opportunity to act on my faith, I took it and was saved. And my family with me. Without faith it
is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and
that he rewards those who earnestly seek him. (simultaneous video 6)
God did not merely spare my mortal life. No, God is able to do more than we can ask or even
imagine. I was adopted into his people, brought into an everlasting relationship with Him. I
married an Israelite man, Salmon. (end video 6) And God blessed me with a remarkable son –
Boaz. Boaz the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth.
Scene 7
RUTH: Like Rahab, I was not born a child of God. I learned of the Lord God of hosts from my
first mother-in-law, Naomi. I had married her son when their family had come to Moab, to
escape a famine. I was married 10 years, 10 long years of barrenness and disgrace before the
devastating death of my husband left me a widow as well as childless.
NAOMI: My daughter-in-law, I have heard that the LORD has come to the aid of his people by
providing food for them. So, go back to your mother's home.

8
RUTH: I will go back with you to your people.
NAOMI: When I return to Bethlehem I will have nothing. I will have to follow behind the
harvesters, picking up what scant gleanings there’ll be after years of famine. And you – you will
be an outcast thrice over: barren, a widow and a foreigner. Return home.
RUTH: My home will be with you.
NAOMI: May the LORD show kindness to you, as you have shown to your dead and to me.
May the LORD grant that you will find rest in the home of another husband here in your
homeland. Now go back.
RUTH: Don't urge me to leave you or to turn back from you.
NAOMI: Am I going to have any more sons, who could become your husband? I am too old. It
is more bitter for me than for you, because the LORD's hand has gone out against me! Why
would you come with me?
RUTH: The gods here in Moab are no gods at all. I admit I will be an alien and a stranger in
Bethlehem. But I am longing for a better country, a heavenly one.
Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your
God my God. Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May your God not be
ashamed to be called my God. (RUTH and NAOMI move to center stage)

NAOMI: By faith Ruth made her home in the Promised Land like a stranger in a foreign country.
If she had been thinking of the country she had left, she would have had opportunity to return.
Instead, Ruth kept her promise, staying with me, caring for me with a faithfulness and kindness
beyond understanding. (Boaz enters)And God was not ashamed to be called her God. (NAOMI
gets baby)
NARR: Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. The Lord enabled her to conceive, and she
gave birth to a son. (NAOMI enters with Obed, WOMAN 1 & 2 step out of choir)
WOMAN 1: Naomi has a son!
WOMAN 2: Praise be to the Lord, who this day has not left you without a kinsman-redeemer.
May he become famous throughout Israel!
WOMAN 1: He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. For your daughter-in-law,
who loves you and who is better to you than seven sons, has given him birth.
NARR: They named him Obed. He was the father of Jesse.

9
Scene 8
MAGI 1: (reading from a scroll) A shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse;
from his roots a Branch will bear fruit.
The Spirit of the LORD will rest on him—
the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding,
the Spirit of counsel and of power,
the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD And he will delight in the fear of the LORD.
He will not judge by what he sees with his eyes,
or decide by what he hears with his ears;
But with righteousness he will judge the needy;
with justice he will give decisions for the poor of the earth.
Righteousness will be his belt
and faithfulness the sash around his waist.
NARR: Jesse was the father of David.
RUTH: Let the Moabite fugitives stay with you;
be their shelter from the destroyer.
In love a throne will be established;
in faithfulness a man will sit on it—
one from the house of David—
one who in judging seeks justice
and speeds the cause of righteousness.
Scene 9
DAVID: King? Yes, I was a king but also an outlaw. I wandered in deserts and mountains, and
in caves and holes in the ground. It was through faith I escaped the edge of the sword; my
weakness was turned to strength; and I became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies. I
conquered kingdoms, administered justice, and gained what was promised.
VO: Behold, the days are coming, when I shall raise up for David a righteous Branch; (DAVID
reverently kneels) and He will reign as king and act wisely and do justice and righteousness in
the land. In His days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely; and this is His name by
which He will be called, `The Lord our righteousness.
He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and I will give Him the throne of
His father David; and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever; and His kingdom will have
no end.

10
DAVID: The zeal of the Lord of hosts will accomplish this. (David rises to his feet, moves to
down center)
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD.
The stone the builders rejected will judge your people in righteousness,
your afflicted ones with justice.
He will defend the afflicted among the people
and save the children of the needy;
he will crush the oppressor.
He will endure as long as the sun,
as long as the moon, through all generations.
The desert tribes will bow before him
The kings of Tarshish and of distant shores
will bring tribute to him;
the kings of Sheba and Seba
will present him gifts.
All kings will bow down to him
and all nations will serve him.
For he will deliver the needy who cry out,
the afflicted who have no one to help.
He will take pity on the weak and the needy
and save the needy from death.
He will rescue them from oppression and violence,
for precious is their blood in his sight.
Long may he live!
May gold from Sheba be given him.
May people ever pray for him
and bless him all day long.
May his name endure forever;
may it continue as long as the sun.
All nations will be blessed through him,
and they will call him blessed.
Praise be to the LORD God, the God of Israel,
who alone does marvelous deeds.

11
Praise be to his glorious name forever;
may the whole earth be filled with his glory.
Amen and Amen.
Scene 10
NARR: What more shall I say? I do not have time to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson,
Jephthah, Samuel and the prophets, Women received back their dead, raised to life again. These
were all commended for their faith, yet none of them received what had been promised. God had
planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect.
MAGI 1: From one man God made every nation of men that they should inhabit the whole earth;
and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live. God did
this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far
from each one of us.
Star appears in the “sky”. The Magi point to it.
MAGI 1: According to Daniel, the time has come for the Messiah. (Reading from a scroll)
Listen! So you are to know and discern that from the issuing of a decree to restore and rebuild
Jerusalem until Messiah, the Prince, there will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks.
MAGI 3: (Agreeing and reading from a scroll) I see him, but not now; I behold him, but not
near; a star shall come forth from Jacob, and a scepter shall rise from Israel.
MAGI 2: (reading from a scroll) And nations will come to your light, And kings to the
brightness of your rising.
MAGI 1: (reading from a scroll) Let the kings of Tarshish and of the islands bring presents; the
kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts... (The other two MAGI pick up gifts) So may he live; and
may the gold of Sheba be given to him; and let them pray for him continually; Let them bless
him all day long.
MAGI 2: (reading from a scroll) You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your
heart. I will be found by you
MAGI 1: Where? Where shall we seek this one, this Messiah, spoken of in these prophesies?
MAGI 3: (reading from a scroll) But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,
though you are small among the clans of Judah,
out of you will come for me
one who will be ruler over Israel,
whose origins are from of old,
from ancient times.

12
Scene 11
NARR: In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged
to the priestly division; his wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron. Both of them were
upright in the sight of God, observing all the Lord's commandments and regulations blamelessly.
But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren; and they were both well along in years.
Zechariah was chosen by lot to go into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. All the
assembled worshipers were praying outside.
ZECHARIAH starts the offering on incense. An angel of the Lord appears, standing at the right
side of the altar of incense. He is startled and gripped with fear
GABRIEL: Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will
bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John. He will be a joy and delight to you, and
many will rejoice because of his birth, for he will be great in the sight of the Lord.
He is never to take wine or other fermented drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even
from birth. Many of the people of Israel will he bring back to the Lord their God. And he will
go on before the Lord, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their
children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready a people prepared
for the Lord.
ZECHARIAH: How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well along in years.
GABRIEL: I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you
and to tell you this good news. And now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day
this happens, because you did not believe my words, which will come true at their proper time.
Scene 12
ZECHARIAH moves to center stage and makes signs since cannot speak. Choir members enter
the scene
WOMAN 1: He has seen a vision!
MAN 1: A vision from the Lord!
Scene 13
NARR: When his time of service was completed, he returned home. (ZECHARIAH and
ELIZABETH move to center stage right) His wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five
months remained in seclusion.


13
ELIZABETH: The Lord has done this for me; in these days he has shown his favor and taken
away my disgrace among the people.
Scene 14
GABRIEL: Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you. (MARY appears
troubled) Do not be afraid, Mary, you have found favor with God. You will be with child and
give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus. He will be great and will be called
the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will
reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end.
MARY: How will this be since I am a virgin?
GABRIEL: The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will
overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God. Even Elizabeth your
relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be barren is in her sixth
month. For nothing is impossible with God.
MARY: I am the Lord's servant. May it be to me as you have said.
MAGI 1 (reading from a scroll) As Isaiah prophesied - The virgin will be with child and will
give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel —which means, "God with us”.
Scene 15
Mary crosses to Elizabeth
MARY: Elizabeth? (Elizabeth grasps her swollen belly, turns to greet her)
ELIZABETH: Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! But why
am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? As soon as the sound of your
greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. Blessed is she who has believed
that what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished!
Scene 16
MARY: (Can be done as a musical solo)
My soul glorifies the Lord
and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
for he has been mindful
of the humble state of his servant.
From now on all generations will call me blessed,
for the Mighty One has done great things for me—
holy is his name.

14
His mercy extends to those who fear him,
from generation to generation.
He has performed mighty deeds with his arm;
he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts.
He has brought down rulers from their thrones
but has lifted up the humble.
He has filled the hungry with good things
but has sent the rich away empty.
He has helped his servant Israel,
remembering to be merciful
to Abraham and his descendants forever,
even as he said to our fathers.

Mary exits
Scene 17
WOMAN 1: Elizabeth has had her child!
ELIZABETH: It’s a boy!
MAN 1: Zechariah is a father. Of a son!
MAN 2: The child should be named after his father.
ELIZABETH: NO! He is to be called John.
WOMAN 2: There is no one among your relatives who has that name.
MAN 1: (to ZACHARIAH) What do you say? (hands him a tablet) What shall he be called?
(ZECHARIAH writes and passes the tablet. Man appears surprised. Reading) His name is John.
ZACHARIAH: Yes, he shall be called John. (People are amazed)
WOMAN 1: What then is this child going to be?
ZACHARIAH: The voice of one crying in the wilderness, `Make ready the way of the Lord,
make His paths straight. He will restore the hearts of the fathers to their children, and the hearts
of the children to their fathers. All flesh shall see the salvation of God. (ZACHARIAH moves
down center, Choir takes their places)
Scene 17b


15

ZACHARIAH:
Praise be to the Lord, the God of Israel,
because he has come and has redeemed his people.
He has raised up a horn of salvation for us
in the house of his servant David
(as he said through his holy prophets of long ago),
salvation from our enemies
and from the hand of all who hate us—
to show mercy to our fathers
and to remember his holy covenant,
the oath he swore to our father Abraham:
to rescue us from the hand of our enemies,
and to enable us to serve him without fear
in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High;
for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for him,
to give his people the knowledge of salvation
through the forgiveness of their sins,
because of the tender mercy of our God,
by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven
to shine on those living in darkness
and in the shadow of death,
to guide our feet into the path of peace.
Scene 18

GABRIEL: Joseph son of David, do not divorce your betrothed. Do not be afraid to take Mary
home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth
to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.
(GABRIEL exits, MARY enters; MARY and JOSEPH move center stage)
Scene 19
NARR: In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the
entire Roman world. So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to
Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. (Shepherds
go to center stage right)
He went there to register with Mary and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him
in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
Scene 20

16
NARR: Shepherds in the fields nearby were keeping watch over their flocks at night.
GABRIEL enters. Maximum intensity light shines on the shepherds who are awakened and
frightened
GABRIEL: Do not be afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.
Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord. This will be a
sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.
CHORUS: Glory to God in the highest,
and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests. Segue into song
SHEPHERD: Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has
told us about.
Song(s). During song(s) Shepherds move to center stage, visit, then go spread the word about
his birth. Audience members are told and a few brought to see the baby.
Scene 21
NARR: On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise him, he was named Jesus, the name
the angel had given him before he had been conceived. Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem
to present him to the Lord as it is written in the Law of the Lord, "Every firstborn male is to be
consecrated to the Lord and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the Law of the
Lord: "a pair of doves or two young pigeons, the offering of the poor who could not afford a
lamb.
Mary, Joseph and baby move downstage right. Simeon sees them, takes the baby and raises one
hand to God.
SIMEON: Sovereign Lord, as you have promised,
you now dismiss your servant in peace.
For my eyes have seen your salvation,
which you have prepared in the sight of all people,
a light for revelation to the Gentiles
and for glory to your people Israel
This child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will
be spoken against, so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce
your own soul too.
ANNA:
For to us a child is born,
to us a son is given,

17
and the government will be on his shoulders.
And he will be called
Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
Of the increase of his government and peace
there will be no end.
He will reign on David's throne
and over his kingdom,
establishing and upholding it
with justice and righteousness
from that time on and forever.
The zeal of the LORD Almighty
will accomplish this.
Mary and Joseph take baby center stage
MAGI 1: As Daniel foretold, the time of the Christ’s coming is at hand. Here is the one who
has been born king of the Jews. We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.
Song(s) They worship and present gifts. MAGI exit. Mary and Joseph lay down. Gabriel touches
Joseph
GABRIEL: Get up, take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you,
for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.
Joseph gets up, takes them and leaves
Scene 22

MAGI 2: (reading from a scroll) And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the
prophet Hosea: "Out of Egypt I called my son.
NARR: When Herod saw that he had been tricked by the magi, he became insanely enraged, and
sent and slew all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all its environs, from two
years old and under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the magi. Then that
which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled. (NARR moves down center)
MAGI 3: (reading from a scroll) A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning,
Rachel weeping for her children; and she refused to be comforted, because they were no more.
NARR: It is of little lasting consequence there was no room in the inn for the Messiah. It will be
of everlasting consequence if you have no room for him in your heart.

18
Jesus is the Messiah. He not only claimed it, he demonstrated it by His fulfillment of every
messianic prophecy we know of, leaving no room for doubt.
What is the probability of any one person fulfilling all the prophesies?
One in 3 million to fulfill just 6 of the 40 prophesies related to Jesus’ birth.
The odds of Jesus fulfilling only eight of the Messianic prophecies as 1 out of 10 17 (a one
followed by 17 zeros). You have a better chance of randomly choosing a specific silver dollar
from a pile covering the entire state of Texas piled two feet high.
Yet all the evidence, no matter how convincing, is not enough. Without faith, it is impossible to
please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards
those who earnestly seek him.
Will you seek the son of God as did the wise men, studying the prophesies then crossing
hundreds of miles following one unusual star?
Would you leave home and family as Ruth and Abraham? Country and nation as Rahab? Live as
an outlaw as David?
Momentarily we’ll ask you to join us in singing O Come All Ye Faithful.
A: If you are one of the faithful and feel so moved, come out of your seat, walk down this aisle
and stand with us, blending your voice with ours.
B: Perhaps you once counted yourself among the faithful but you have fallen away, your love
has grown cold. Draw near to God and he will draw near to you. You too can step out of your
seat and into the aisle and join us, rededicating your life to him.
C: Jesus described himself as the Good Shepherd. He told a parable in Luke, chapter 15, about a
shepherd who loses one of his sheep, who leaves the 99 and goes after the one lost sheep until he
finds it. Then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says, 'Rejoice with me; I have found
my lost sheep.' I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one
sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.
If you want to turn your life over to Jesus, or just find out more about becoming a Christian, step
into the aisle, come down. We have people ready to talk to you, this very night. (Choir and
characters move downstage, to the floor, a person or two in each aisle)
NARR: Please stand as we sing. For whatever your reasons, if you are so moved, join us down
front as we sing.


19
O Come All Ye Faithful
Joyful and triumphant,
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem.
Come and behold Him,
Born the King of Angels;
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord.
O Sing, choirs of angels,
Sing in exultation,
Sing all that hear in heaven God's holy word.
Give to our Father glory in the Highest;
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord.
All Hail! Lord, we greet Thee,
Born this happy morning,
O Jesus! For evermore be Thy name adored.
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing;
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord.

NARR: Merry Christmas and God bless!
